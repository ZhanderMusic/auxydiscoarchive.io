        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I just wanted to say thank you for these people for inspiring me on my Auxy journey, and guys, even if you think you make awful music, listen, it doesn’t need to have noisia’s mastering or skrillex’s insane leads. It’s your music, and that’s what matters. Thank you…<br>

And there’s probably many more. (You can only mention 10 people in a post)<br>
If you weren’t included on the list, don’t worry. I just wanted to say again, anyone who thinks their music is terrible, not many people can write a melody that has rhythm. This goes out to everyone on this forum. Thank you, everyone…</p> ]]></description>

<p>

 So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish is the fourth book of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy "trilogy of six books" written by Douglas Adams. Its title is the message left by the dolphins when they departed Planet Earth just before it was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, as described in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. A song of the same name was featured in the 2005 film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
 While hitchhiking through the galaxy, Arthur De...</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Well written my man.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of apps go the way of the dodo, I’ve been doing this iOS music thing for quite some time:</p>

<p>The worst thing is that each year you just wait to see who draws the short straw when Apple releases a new OS version. APIs and portions of SDKs get deprecated, stuff just stops working. When the 32bit Appocalypse happened (Google it, very real) we lost a lot of good apps. I don’t think we have to worry about anything quite that drastic for a bit, but if apps aren’t maintained all those other changes Apple makes can very, very much break existing apps and then poof, gone.</p>
<p>I do hope they continue to support the app, even if just for critical fixes. I myself don’t use it any more, but from ~2017 through 2018 it’s all I was using, and there’s quite a bit of music I wrote on it. It was nice to be able to dip in and have good chats with younger folks who were eager (sometimes) to learn, and even though things got pretty out of hand sometimes it was all good fun overall.</p>
<p>I salute you <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/auxy">@Auxy</a> - you guys made a pretty killer app that brought a lot of people together, and still does. I’d agree keeping this place open doesn’t make sense, but I’m going to agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mrserpent">@MrSerpent</a> that it might be nice to have some kind of update or blog or something on your site. Henrik, you’re ex Propellerheads right? They nailed it with the blog, mini roadmaps and artist stories. Hell you don’t even need the latter… but even just a blog would be cool.</p>
<p>Unless the app is in strict maintenance mode. Then never mind. But anywho.</p>
<p>This went on a lot longer than I intended, haha, I guess there’s just a lot to say. To this day I’ll confess out of all apps I’ve tried on iOS, everything from “big boy” DAWs to little noise makers, Auxy is the fastest, most cohesive, complete package to bring an idea from zero to completion in a very quick way.

I agree with 100%.</p>
<p>(I’m still personally of the view that the best thing for Auxy might be for Lenberg to sell it, and I’m wondering what a community/DAO buy-out might look like.</p>
<p>It’s my belief that Auxy will just exist in the background for them, producing a steady flow of (now passive) income. There’s little reason for them to do anything new/more.</p>

<p>Imo, there are still some very obvious bits missing from which the app, the users, and the music made using Auxy would greatly benefit.</p>
<p>(I also strongly believe there is good market potential in opening Auxy up to the creation and use of 3rd-party sound packs, creating a side-market, and giving the app a better shelf-life.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Those who joined back when monthly sound packs were part of the <s>offer</s> promise (<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed.png?v=12" title=":raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:" class="emoji" alt=":raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">), and the became ‘locked in’ by having a large backlog of formative ideas stored in a proprietary format (and no batch export/port options) (<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/raised_hand.png?v=12" title=":raised_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":raised_hand:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) is one thing. But having a forever frozen library of a couple of dozen sound packs (of patchy quality and flexibility) and a thousands of often indistinguishable, and certainly difficult to navigate, one-hit samples isn’t likely to drive sign-ups compared to apps which are evidently alive and which shows signs of having new content/assets (and engagement with, and respect for, their own user community) to refresh and expand production options and drive a sense that you’re part of something alive and interesting.</p>
<p>Consequently, Auxy is likely to experience gradual slope off of downloads and subscriptions (it likely already is). Without a Plan B, that only ends one way — and that would really be a shame.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Well, I’ve had some pretty great memories on the Auxy forum. A particular highlight for me was DHO (&amp; stereofield)'s biannual music tournaments that really brought everyone together. I distinctly remember coming home from school one day being super excited that I got put into the bracket for the tournament (in 2017) and I tried to participate in every one that’s been hosted since then.</p>
<p>There’s been a fair bit of (deserved) discussion about the questionable business practices of the Auxy team, and sure, it’s valid (and crucial to the maintenance of the app) to hold Lenberg and company accountable for the mistakes and provide “customer feedback” about what aspects we feel could be improved about the app, which extends to grievances about lack of communication, skipping monthly sound packs installations without clarification, and stuff like that. A lot of points have been brought up and discussed about that and my hope is that as long as this app continues to exist (and have a thriving userbase) we’ll be able to communicate to the Auxy team our frustrations and have some sort of clear cut foundation where we can understand what their general plans are for the app.</p>
<p>The Auxy Collective (now AC Community) has ~1700 users and around 100 really active musicians, “oldies” who have been around since 2017 and newcomers alike, who strive to achieve their creative heights and are doing it primarily (or solely) with Auxy. I am one of those producers, and have been since I found/started using it in 2016. This could come off as a little corny to some of you who take a more casual angle to Auxy and use it in conjunction with other music software but I really, really care about this app. It’s presence plays a huge role in an aspect of my life I consider significant, and the “connections” (friendships) I’ve made with fellow musicians in the community has been really foundational to me. So I guess what I’m trying to say is, I really don’t want Auxy to be taken off the app store. I know pulling the plug on a long-abandoned forum that had it coming for a long time doesn’t equate to taking the app off the app store but I feel like the Auxy devs could really benefit from some more interaction within the community. You don’t even have to be in control of some forum, in fact just popping into user communities periodically or posting on a blog or something is perfectly acceptable. Even if it seems like it would go to waste and people wouldn’t care about it, just know that there are die-hard Auxy users out there – not just people looking at it as a “failed business” but as an innovation in musicianship and artistry, and not superficially either like some kind of tech magazine thing. This app has had such a grasp over me in my continuous use of it in the past five years that were it to stop existing, my music career would either stop entirely or take a drastically, fundamentally different approach. I don’t even think I can explain in words how much this app has affected me, and I don’t think I’m the only person to feel this way about it when I consider my conversations with other musicians in the Auxy Collective.</p>
<p>This has become a really long rambley akabill/ThoughtfulNoise-tier post, but the main point I want to get across is that I have a ton of passion for this app; it got me to take music seriously when I started using it at a young age, it gave me a community of other young people who were going through the exact same motions as me and figuring out their creative processes using the same streamlined and intuitive features, as well as constant updates and forum interaction from the devs during 2016 and 2017 (and going into 2018), which is I guess when they were ironing out the kinks and fine-tuning the App.</p>
<p>I think Lenberg/the Auxy team has been quoted as saying something along the lines of this: that the lack of updates is a result of a natural slowdown / settling into the definitive version of the app. I am actually OK with that. Another groundbreaking innovation from this app would be nice, and like, there are a lot of things that desktop DAWs can do that Auxy cannot, but Lenberg and team are tasked with striking a balance between an App with the functionality of a desktop DAW at the expense of jam packing it with a ton of features that completely stifles the fluidity and immediacy that the app has to offer. E.g - I made and released an album this year in the span of five days. Each song took me three hours at most start to finish. Every song sounds up to (my) standards – music with flair and pizzazz and tracks that I am personally just really satisfied with. I really feel like this is a workflow I can only achieve in Auxy, even when it comes to mobile production --no, <em>especially</em> when it comes to mobile production because its simplicity and intuitiveness really stands out among a lot of mobile DAWs. I’m pretty sure Lenberg knows this, and I actually think Auxy team set out to make a DAW with this level of simplicity and grace because they wanted an App on the market that could achieve what Auxy does. My other hypothesis is that the community came from people who were drawn in by Auxy’s simple learning curve and how easy it was to collaborate, and maybe the community expanded and grew by luck, but I bet it especially grew because the Auxy devs used to be really communicative and COOL, like Auxy was the awesome uncle of electronic music production that gave you sweet sound packs and new features even when it wasn’t Christmas. This is all just me saying I really feel like Auxy had a ton of passion for the App. And while the stony silence we’ve been getting from them for the past few years(!) might suggest otherwise, I have hope that their passion for the niche they created Auxy to fulfill hasn’t fully dried up. Maybe I’m just desperate because I have grown to love this app and can’t bear to imagine it fully just crumbling and having support taken out from under it (although I think Lenberg has explicitly stated that he doesn’t want to do this). In either case, I can do without the nostalgia that I have for the “good old days” of constant Auxy updates and user interaction because I don’t think there’s anything stopping the devs from doing cool stuff with this app. Also, I don’t necessarily think giving Lenberg an ultimatum every other post to “sell the app” or take some drastic decision to “save the community” is the answer to this silence, because that takes the stance that Lenberg and co don’t care about Auxy anymore, which might seem the case from their lack of community interaction, but I don’t want to be a doomsday preacher about Auxy even if maybe the notion that Auxy will eventually become a “dead app” is not completely unfounded. I just want it to be known that there are a lot of musicians who REALLY care about Auxy, and some form of communication like a blog (with FUN stuff, it doesn’t even have to be boring updates!) or just some way for the devs to wet their feet in the treacherous waters without being teared down by unsatisfied consumers – NO. There is more to this community than Unsatisfied Consumerism. There are a ton of artists who capital “L” Love this app and want to see it thrive like it arguably once did.</p>
<p>So, keep the forum alive? Not completely necessary: as you’ve said, there is another, far more active community full of passionate discussion (ok, and a fair share of memes, but the reputation that every Auxy user is 12 might be slightly exaggerated and even if true isn’t <em>really</em> cause for neglecting the rest of us non middle schoolers.)</p>
<p>Join the AC discord? I vaguely remember you joining once and then promptly leaving. I don’t blame you, it can get a little hectic. I don’t know what the consensus on the discord is, but my personal thoughts are that there is a wealth of really insightful disucssion from COOL musicians more akin to the early days of this forum, while arguably having WAY more memes then even this forum did back in its memiest days. So the discord might not be the <em>best</em> way to interact with users, especially since the instant-messaging angle leaves a lot less room for disapproval when someone responds to your genuine thoughts with (generally light-hearted) memery or just outright ignores it.</p>
<p>Create (or alter?) a website (like <a href="http://auxy.co" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">auxy.co</a>?) to have a blog feature with periodical updates and dev-created and -approved content reminiscent of the awesome Auxy promotional videos you did for Auxy 2.0 and the first few soundpacks? Maybe you don’t have to hire a film crew for every update, but it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to let your userbase know your app is still alive and kickin’ it.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not a marketing expert. I have not read a single book or taken a single class about business. I’m simply thinking out loud on behalf of the Auxy devs because I want this App/its surrounding community to succeed. I don’t think these are groundbreaking ideas. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Auxy team has been thinking of these ideas (possibly numerous times, in various levels of “panic mode” in light of the growing (possibly exaggerated) dissatisfaction from vocal app users (who are be assumed to be voicing their opinions out of care for the app and not viciousness)). Yes, it’s true that programmers weren’t made for social media damage control. Yes, it’s true that the mind to innovate and create awesome ideas like Auxy might not necessarily be the same mind that creates and maintains a successful forum surrounding the community. We’ve seen this play out actually - the prime community for Auxy-related discussion was created and is maintained by Fans Of The App.</p>
<p>I’m going to re-iterate that I don’t want to be a doomsday preacher about the “Doomed Fate of Auxy”. I think the state of the app is fine – we don’t actually NEED a pack every month, we were just PROMISED one every month so the lack of monthly sound packs creates this weird inherent dissatisfaction from being lied to (at least that’s how I see it, but I’m not a sociologist either). However, I don’t even think you could argue that the almost non-existent user interaction from the devs has benefited the community. You could <em>maybe</em> argue that the community doesn’t NEED that interaction because Auxy is Stable and Works Quite Well and there Really Isn’t Much Else To Say. Which works at a fundamental level, I guess. I mean, the app still exists. But at a deeper level (pre-fundamental?) the argument becomes kind of weak, because as you can see the disco isn’t NEARLY as fun / peppy / interactable / cool as it was. Why? Did we all grow up? Is it all Lenberg’s fault. OK, maybe we can’t chalk up the reason of the forum’s decline to one particular reason, but the solution to fixing this kind of stuff is to just start trying new things and ideating and doing what feels right. Lenberg and co, I don’t think even you feel comfortable about being silent for so long (beyond the occasional peep in the Disco and a fairly active SoundCloud account). This just doesn’t feel right.</p>
<p>You don’t have to resurrect the Auxy Forums from the dead in some kind of glorious ritual, but if you ever create a blog or update your YouTube channel with some updates and extras for the community, first of all I would eat that up for breakfast because I’m a self proclaimed mega-stan of this App, but secondly I think it would be not only a big help for us “concerned customers” who are actually aspiring artists and creatives, but it would be really fun, and I think some fun is really the key ingredient in the prescription of what this community in general needs to get back on its feet.</p>
<p>This may or may not be my last post on this forum, and if it is, and if you’re reading this Auxy team, please just know that I’m rooting for you guys and I want this app to be a success story because it has kind of been my key to success as a musician. And I leave you with that.</p> ]]></description>

<p>I set up a discourse forum.</p>
<p>I might use it for personal uses anyway, but if you wanna try it, you can.</p>
<p>I know discord has the forum feature but it’s still pretty lightweight and eh I don’t use discord much anyways.</p>
<p>I archived some topics from the Disco there, in case people are looking for them later e.g. wikis, sound pack demos. People can move them from there — was just trying to save some before this place shuts down, and we forget them.</p> ]]></description>
