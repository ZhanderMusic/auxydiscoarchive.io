    <title>Post your finished Auxy tracks here!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/post-your-finished-auxy-tracks-here/136</link>
    <description>BSJ here!  Post your best tracks here and let me give a listen!  My goal is to lift some of the burden off of the Auxy team by helping them repost more tracks so they can focus more on the building of the already AMAZING app.  So every few days I&#39;ll hear your tracks and give my picks to them and who knows!!  Maybe they&#39;ll give you a repost.. 😉  

There is a catch.  I want FINISHED tracks.  Let&#39;s try to keep the thread clean by not posting projects and small tunes!  Let&#39;s DO IT.</description>

Only thing I might recommend is a different kick, the one you have right now doesn’t really fit the song imo.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m very new to Auxy and this is actually my first song ever in it: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/meandmoto/darth-hoff" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/meandmoto/darth-hoff</a></p>
<p>Even though it’s not my usual style, I was inspired by the Jeremy Olander Auxy promo video to just get it finished. At first, I wasn’t feeling it, but as I pushed myself to get it done, I started to really like it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I appreciate what you’re doing here and thanks for listening!</p>

            <p>Ever since the original came into the Auxy feed, it has been by far one of my favorite Auxy songs of all time. I’ve had a blast listening to this song continuously on SoundCloud, so I thought that it was about time to have my take on it be shared with the world. Hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>The original is even better than the remix, so I highly recommend to check it out!<br>
