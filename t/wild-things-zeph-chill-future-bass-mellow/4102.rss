    <title>Wild Things - Zeph [Chill/Future Bass, Mellow]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/wild-things-zeph-chill-future-bass-mellow/4102</link>
    <description>Hello again! Here I am with another track, I will admit, this one was a little easier than other genres I have made. This is a new genre for me though so I don&#39;t expect it to top the charts you know? Anyway, I finalized it in a record 2 days lol, that&#39;s a first for me since it usually takes me around a week or two to finish a track. Hopefully you enjoy it! Don&#39;t hesitate to repost it if you liked it :)
