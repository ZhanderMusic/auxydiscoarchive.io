            <p>Ok I was going through your stuff, and I found the hall of the mountain king thing… THATS SO COOL it’s awesome that you put it in 6/8, that’s such a creative thing that I never could have thought of.</p>
<p>I think in general, after listening to tracks like Blitz and Ruthless, I’m definitely getting the EDM energy, but melodies, chord progressions, and basslines sometimes seem random. I think the melodic patterns is what you should work on to improve, but I think so far, you’re doing very well.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work and neat music!</p>

            <p>“I think youre doing a good job with tge dubstep feel with the bass and such. One thing for me is id change the last half of the first melody loop, the one that was chromatic(?) the second half of that instrument loop felt like it was random while the first sounded really good… just some friendly feedback :)” - my comment on Blitz</p>
<p>Ruthless (vip) was also good. I liked the bass in the stop really well</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/limez">@LimeZ</a> I’m in a rush, so I’ll give feedback on my two favorites:</p>
<p>Blitz: Wow! That drop was really good. One thing that is really important in a dubstep song, though, is variation. The drop gets a little bit boring, so try to switch it up a little halfway through. Also, for the intro, the bass is really loud, maybe choose a different one or turn the volume down? Final thought - the melody seems a bit off - like it doesn’t fit the chords you chose. Overall, though, awesome track!</p>
<p>Cyclone Remix: (I don’t know if I can give feedback on a remix but I will for now) I’ve heard the original before and you turned <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon40211422">@anon40211422</a>’s song into something completely different! The drop was really nice, in my opinion! Not much else I can say except for the fact that the mix was kind of muddy and cluttered. Overall, I think this track is your best yet!</p>
<p>Overall, you definitely have a lot of potential as a great EDM artist!<br>
Keep up the good work!</p>
