    <title>Auxy Forum - Track of the Week #30 [Winner Announced]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-30-winner-announced/19221</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @Mr_Mooo 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Hey! Sorry for the wait, I‚Äôve been dealing with some stuff irl at the same time as this. But I have chosen a winner! This was an extremely tough decision, and I actually had 3 people tie for  very close second, but the winner for this week is‚Ä¶</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/thomaisho">@Thomaisho</a> with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-161462983/in-spirit" rel="nofollow noopener">In Spirit</a>! I absolutely adored this song, Thomaisho never fails to impress me and this was no exception, being extremely original and very complex and well polished. Very well done! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=9" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"></p>
<p>Every single entry was extremely amazing however, so you should all be proud of yourselves for it, and for releasing music more frequently than I do <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_hand_over_mouth.png?v=9" title=":face_with_hand_over_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_hand_over_mouth:"></p>
<p>Congrats Thomaisho!</p>
