    <title>AasHesh - Morning Vibes (Zeph Remix) [chill] [project file] [public use]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/aashesh-morning-vibes-zeph-remix-chill-project-file-public-use/3817</link>
    <description>I was scrolling through my top links and I found this gem: https://disco.auxy.co/t/want-someone-to-remix-or-add-to-your-track-post-it-here/773/8
A remix of @AasHeshâ€™s Morning Vibes BTC (I believe). Unfortunately, I was unhappy with how it was, so I remixed the remix.
It turned out a lot shorter than I had anticipated but it is good exercise ðŸ’ª 
If you want to ~~steal~~ use my ideas and make a full song, you can.
