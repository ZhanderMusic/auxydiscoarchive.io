    <title>Diagnostics Episodic Remix Chalenge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/diagnostics-episodic-remix-chalenge/20515</link>
    <description>As a celebration and a rework of my 2nd album, I’m going to allow you to remix the entirety of Diagnostics, every single track on it! 
Every 2 week episode will include the project. 
Yes you get to mess around with the artwork too!
