    <title>Xxx_d - Rapper required [Collab]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/xxx-d-rapper-required-collab/12600</link>
    <description>I don’t want anyone to steal the beat so I’m keeping it until someone DMs me. The kind of rap? I need someone with not a lot of tone, more like “on a single key” rap. After DM I’ll send it to you, and try to make it Top 50 worthy, I’ll mess with the vocals to make it better. I plan on releasing it on Spotify When it becomes free, if you have a distrokid (any distributer) account, then I’ll let you publish. Any questions leave a comment. I’ll try to reply as soon as possible.</description>
