For any veteran Auxy user, the drum kits may sound familiar. That&#39;s because this track was made back in Auxy 4, before the drum sample overhaul.

This was originally a tournament submission in one of DHO&#39;s tournaments that is unfortunately not gonna happen again due to the drastic decrease in Auxy Disco traffic, at least, that&#39;s how I&#39;m seeing it.</description>
