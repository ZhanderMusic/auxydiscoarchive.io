    <title>Samples getting lost</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/samples-getting-lost/17362</link>
    <description>Does anyone else have this problem?

I import my samples into Auxy in a specific Auxy folder, and somehow, over time, that folder in Auxy gets randomly deleted due to maybe a lost connection, and I have to import all of my samples back in Auxy all over again for my projects.</description>

            <p>I can testify to this happening to me as well, and I don’t know why, but I think it has to do with the type of audio file the sample is? I seem to lose most of my .wav files, but for some reason, have kept all of my .mp4 files…</p>
