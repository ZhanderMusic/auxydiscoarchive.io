            <p>I guess this genre is too niche in the Auxy community that no one wants to even keep general discussion alive. Welp.</p>

            <p>So according to this section, we have some basis on what Eurobeat is like. I read a little bit more of the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Eurobeat as we know it is actually more Japanese in origin than European. Original Eurobeat is more of a type of High-NRG/Italo Disco, but with a few common rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eurobeat primarily utilizes an octave bass instead of any other sort of bass rhythm, though there can be some instances of gallop bass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snare is almost non-existent in Eurobeat, especially J-Eurobeat, which is the style most people are familiar with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The beginning of a track is structured similarly to the chorus and bridge of the track. The riff is basically an instrumental version of the chorus, with a very technical melody that’s usually repeated after the first chorus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the melos (short for melody) can be choruses or even verses, though the second melo (b melo) in any given track is mainly used as a bridge.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While modern music is often recognized by its lyrics, Eurobeat is recognized not primarily by its lyrics. Very much like Eurodance, it usually has extremely silly or utterly meaningless lyrics. This broad genre can create a great number of different subgenres within it because of this combination of harmony and rhythm. Sometimes it can still sound like disco music, and sometimes it can be very “fast and happy” like happy hardcore or speed music, and occasionally features guitars as a method of Saiba.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One peculiar thing about Eurobeat is the fact that each artist is often credited with a variety of different aliases. Artists usually adopt different stage names according to the mood of each song, or depending on who wrote their lyrics. For instance, has stated on the SCP Music website that he goes by the name of “Fastway” on songs which are more upbeat and sprinkled with high-pitched female backing vocals, and goes by “Dusty” on his more “serious” tracks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like most musical genres, (modern) Eurobeat has a fairly specific formula to it:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>beginning → riff (musical synth) → a melo (verse) → b melo (bridge) → sabi (chorus) → riff (musical synth) → c melo → ending</p>

            <p>Hello, all. I propose that we go ahead and blaze a new trail within the Auxy community— Eurobeat. Now, the genre has sort of a meme status thanks to Initial D (which is mainly the reason why it’s so well-known across the internet nowadays), but it’s also a very under-represented genre in general nowadays. Especially within the Auxy community. I don’t even know if someone has done Auxy Eurobeat yet, but I’m willing to be one of the first. Join me, brothers and sisters. Please. Thanks.</p>
