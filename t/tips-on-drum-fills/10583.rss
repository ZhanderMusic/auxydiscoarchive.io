    <description>Hey!

I think that drum fills are a huge part of drops, and rumor has it that you guys are pretty darn [spoiler](sorry christian minecraft server :raised_hands::latin_cross::pray:)[/spoiler] good at making them. Feel free to share your tips!

Definitely asking for a friend,

        <title>Tips on Drum Fills</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been drumming for three years (not long, I know), and I regularly try to use beats I want to make myself on the kit, or have made already. In terms of fills… look up some cool fills on youtube to get your brain going (or I might just link them later on in this post but whatevs).</p>
<p>There’s a big natural aspect to explore in terms of how you can make fills, and a great idea to think about is using the soft (pls can we have velocity control) function to make drum rolls in fills (and this isn’t limited to snares – anything is fair game).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1_dO6AI-e0?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1_dO6AI-e0</a></p>
<p>Here’s the first result for “drum fills” I got on YouTube, so this looks like a decent place to start as any.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihjC7xe52gY?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihjC7xe52gY</a></p>
<p>And here’s an unlisted video I straight up just posted right now with me not really explaining anything and also being mediocre on my old kit.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to how you wanna use your fills. You can build or bridge or do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Don’t know if this helped or not due to me being vague as all hell, but… here we are. Hope it did help.</p>

<p>When in doubt, ask yourself, how would Phil Collins do it.</p>
<p>90% of you probably won’t know who this is. Sorry.</p>
<p>BUT. Partial jestery aside, I think it’s beneficial to watch actual drummers. Watch a lot of drummers. Or get a kit yourself, even a cheapo one, to familiarize yourself with what’s HUMANLY possible. It’s really easy to go cray with programming drums and they aren’t going to sound realistic, which is absolutely what you don’t want in this case. We have two legs and two arms (most of us) - there’s only so many pieces of the kit you can hit at the same time. Understanding this and how each piece works with each other will help you become a better drum programmer overall, and of course, with that will come better fills.</p>

            <p>Like with other artists, it’s really all about how you want your overall track to sound. Definitely listen to other people’s songs so you can get a grasp on how they use drum fills.</p>
<p>Just try not to copy other people, make your song a style of its own</p>

        <title>Tips on Drum Fills</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Matik]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Whenever I have drum fills, most of the time I use different types of toms and put lowpass and reverb on them, with the addition of changing pitches to each tom.</p>
<p>Other times I just use the same tom and have different pitches set for each of those toms and make an ascending to descending progression in triplets.</p>
<p>It all depends on the mood of the track as well. If you wanna have toms in a big drum buildup, I suggest using the second option and slowly rise it by putting volume automation on the entire drum kit until it finally reaches the climax.</p>
<p>For quick drum fills just before a drop or in between the drop and the second interval, I usually use the first option. In addition to this, you can add a progression of ascending to descending or descending to ascending notes that play during the drum fill.</p>
<p>Also, just experimenting with random sounds and percussion and seeing what sounds interesting for your track can work as well.</p>
<p>Not the best at giving out tips, but I hope this helped!</p>
