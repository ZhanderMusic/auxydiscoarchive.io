I&#39;m pointing at the top where it says &quot;41% of free uploads used&quot;. I want to make a lot more tracks in the future, plus I don&#39;t have a job yet, so I don&#39;t know what to do with this. I almost used half of it already. Also the &quot;Try Pro Unlimited&quot; only popped out a few days ago, so it&#39;s fairly recent. You can&#39;t see that bar on the SoundCloud app itself, but when I went to the website version in order to make custom genre, I was dismayed as heck. What do you guys think? The first thing I thought of was to make multiple emails, but then it would be tedious to handle. I&#39;m just very melancholic that the very accessible website now has limitations. Sorry for the long rant. üç™üëÅüëÑüëÅ</description>

            <p>Remember private tracks count as upload time too. I have 95% of my upload time used strictly because I have about 45 tracks that are private. Make sure to go through those if you have any:)</p>

            <p>I deleted some old beats to save up more time because the more you delete your worst beats, the more time you have left in the status bar.</p>
