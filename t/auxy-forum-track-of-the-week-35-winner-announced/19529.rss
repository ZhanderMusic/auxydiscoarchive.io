        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cursed">@cursed</a>. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Somewhat a track of two halves.<br>
The track first started forming around the heavier section at 2:16. I was layering up and just got hooked on the vibe.</p>
<p>I saved that moody section out separately and passively listened to it on loop while working, while I get underneath what I wanted to do with it.</p>
<p>The second part was actually a separate idea I‚Äôd been playing with for a while, but hadn‚Äôt really developed.<br>
The main riff and general vibe was inspired by a mid-'80s instrumental soul track ‚Äì <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Dznd1jJR0" rel="nofollow noopener">Twilight by Maze</a> ‚Äì one of my favourite tracks from that time.</p>
<p>(I‚Äôd also been inspired by the recent DX100 from Mars pack, which is based on FM synthesis that was hugely popular in the mid-'80s. So, I had retro themes buzzing round in my head.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
While listening to the first chord-based part on loop, I started humming the melody I‚Äôd produced for this second idea ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when the two parts came together to ultimately become the track <em>Late Night</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I enjoyed finishing the track out ‚Äî though, as always, I never really stop thinking of other things I could do with it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I particularly enjoy hearing when the track transitions out of the first heavier section. The plaintive horn and the buzzy lead that thins out. It‚Äôs like exhaling, and the air clears and everything gets quiet and mellow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Quietly proud of this one. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks again for giving the track ‚ÄòTrack of the Week‚Äô.<br>
Glad you enjoyed it!</p>

            <p>All the tracks were really well produced, but only one really hit the vibe for this week.</p>
<p>*drum rolls</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/thoughtfulnoise">@ThoughtfulNoise</a> !</p>
<p>The intro sold me. No unecessary details, it feels like the perfect transition from Monday to Friday. Im in love with the heavy, distorted yet mellow chords in the first half and the groovy rhodes-like leads in the second, not to forget the hypnotizing plucks which compliment the rhythm overall. Dont sleep on this!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for the submissions! Keep making awesome music :))</p>
