    <title>Chromatic and Key</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/chromatic-and-key/9165</link>
    <description>I have a question that I haven&#39;t found an answer for.
If I choose to make the whole project chromatic. Why can I still change the key? Or is it the actual tuning I change?
As an example: I chose to write the loop in chromatic and use the notes in the key of C. Then I can go and change the key slider to G. What key am I in now? I understand the feature if you have the loops in non-chromatic as the numbering represents the order of the notes in the choosen key. Shouldn&#39;t the key slider be obsolete if you choose chromatic mode?</description>

            <p>Hi fam!</p>
<p>Sorry for bringing this up again but I really need some help.</p>
<p>It’s just that I can’t find the chromatic mode anymore. I wonder if it was because of the new update that changed the settings or because I am not currently under subscription.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/shadowofunicorns">@shadowofunicorns</a>. I didn’t check that up. I just listned. But as <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> say it’s only true if you stay true to the key that is choosen. I will look at it as tuning the instruments to a key.</p>

            <p>It would be nice however to have a <em>true</em> chromatic option, where the keyboard spans the lowest notes of the lowest key to the highest notes of the highest key. A problem that would occur with this however would be that you wouldn’t be able to change back to the non-chromatic option that you had before.</p>
<p>Why did the team decide that you can’t undo a chromatic loop anyway? They could’ve kept the warning saying that some out-of-key notes would be removed like they used to.</p>

            <p>That’s only accurate if you write in the same key as set in the project preferences - which might be rare.</p>
<p>(I always only ever use Chromatic and never bother touching the key setting. I just dive in.)</p>
<p>When in Chromatic mode, with access to all notes, you’re free to write in whatever key you want - regardless of the key set in the project preferences.</p>
<p>The key setting may say C, but you could be writing in F. In which case, shifting the key setting up/down is about relative changes, rather than actually objective specifying which key your music is now in.</p>

            <p>Still haven’t received an answer about this. However, I’m going to assume the kicks are in the key of C, because that is what they sound to be tuned to at the very least. At least, the ones from the external packs. Pretty sure some of the default (OG) sounds are tuned differently.</p>
