    <title>Safest way to archive an Auxy track?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/safest-way-to-archive-an-auxy-track/12269</link>
    <description>I finished a song. It includes Auxy samples and synths, but also custom samples loaded from my iCloud.

I don&#39;t want to keep it on my iPad forever. What&#39;s the best way to archive it so I could reload it in the future, without risk of missing samples or sounds?</description>

            <p>Yup, or even better, as you’re working on a track, give it a subfolder with the samples used in the track. Cause if you have a mess of Samples in “Auxy/Samples” you’re gonna have a hard time sorting it out. Just don’t make any folders before “Auxy/Samples/(song title)” - will only go down one level under Samples</p>

            <p>If I understand correctly, once you’ve finished with a track, you figure out every sample you use, you duplicate it to a song-specific folder and then re-assign the same in Auxy to point to the one in the song-specific folder? Am I saying that back correctly? Thanks!</p>

            <p>I do this all the time. Well I keep it in iCloud but you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Make a subfolder off the Auxy/Samples folder with the song title or something that makes sense. Fix your drum tracks with the samples to point to this folder. Open up <a href="http://iCloud.com">iCloud.com</a> on a PC or you can even use the Files app on iOS to copy the folder with the samples and the Auxy project file somewhere else.</p>
<p>A little hoop jumpy, but at least you can do it all on your device</p>
