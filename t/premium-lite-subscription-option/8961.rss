    <title>Premium (Lite) Subscription Option</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/premium-lite-subscription-option/8961</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen multiple users on the forum point out how the premium subscription could be a bit much for them, even at $5 a month. Especially for those who live in other countries. Here are a few of them.

[quote=&quot;Twixes, post:727, topic:6582, full:true&quot;]
Auxy’s great but the pricing is very steep for someone who lives in Poland (or any ex-Eastern Bloc country for that matter). 5 bucks doesn’t sound like much but that, after comparing average incomes, is to a Pole like 15 dollars is to an American. That’s why Spotify, for example, costs around 5 dollars (19,99 zlotys, actually) a month here instead of the usual 10. And Auxy at 20,99 zlotys a month is really expensive.

I hope you and Fredrik understand that $50-$60 a year is quite a lot of money for people like me and many others on the forum

Whyyy… :frowning: there is no way I can afford this

Unfortunately there is going to be a lot of young producers being left out and shut out of the app because of this…

I do not know if this update is good . But I believe that many users do not have the money for .
[/quote]

This, by the way, only accounts for those with forum accounts. 

The premium subscription system is apparently necessary both from a purely logistical perspective and also an economic perspective. However, @Auxy @Fredrik a possible solution is that you could make a subscription option for $1-3 a month that would give access to certain sound packs (maybe every other one released) and a portion of the sample library. 

It&#39;d bring back a lot of the crowd that can&#39;t afford the regular subscription, be it geography, age, or desire, while still keeping everything streamlined (i.e. everything still is based on some sort of subscription rather than having an individual sound pack option and a subscription option).</description>

</aside>
<p>Sample import basically renders any effects almost unimportant. Unless they’re synthesized effects, most often you’ll find better effects from loops online or anywhere else. As a sweeper is pretty much only noise, as it should be, having that as itself makes sense, but not necessarily other things.</p>
<p>And yeah, it is a step in the opposite direction :\</p>

            <p>They’ve moved away from the “buy once” SoundPack model, so this would kind of be a step in the opposite direction as to what this thread is suggesting which is modified forms of the subscription payment model.</p>

            <p>Why not have the option to sort of buy a “bulk” pack? Where you can select a minimum of 5 instruments (bass, synth, drum, <strong>effects which we need more of</strong>) and the cost depends on how many instruments you buy, and you basically own them permanently.</p>

            <p>That’s a workaround though, not a solution xD I mean sure but then there’s more issues to be had. The premise of what I was talking about was that the matter of convenience is what would detur importing the entire 3000+ sample library on some sort of lite option</p>

            <p>I can’t test this right now, but, I wonder if you used a kick sample built in with the volume all the way down and then triggered it at the same time as the kick sample you import it would work. Ie does ducking follow just strictly the trigger OR the actual kick sample itself.</p>

<p>Not quite. iCloud loading isn’t the most functional part of Auxy (Specifically, if you have poor connection or a large amount of items on your iCloud as <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/kerfuffle">@Kerfuffle</a> has mentioned, things work poorly). Not only this, but the matter of convenience is an issue, and iCloud samples can’t function as kicks that will register with the ducker.</p>

            <p>I’d find the best solution to be, you play less and you can pick, say, 6 extra sample packs for a month/year. The other ones are still restricted, but the person still gets that freedom.</p>

            <p>To get back on the topic of subscription, I’d like to address this (bit of a necropost, I know.)</p>
<p>I have seen almost nobody on the forum disrespecting the Auxy team’s work (please feel free to let me know of anybody that you have seen exhibiting such behavior). Suggesting more features and sharing opinions on the cost / value ratio for Auxy is much different than disrespecting or putting down the efforts one has put into making a product. It seems that you find the current feature set for the given price point to be reasonable, which is great. That’s the entire reason I proposed <strong>keeping the current subscription plan and also possibly adding another lite subscription plan with a lower feature set but also a lower cost</strong> for those who feel differently than you do.</p>
<p>I don’t disagree that people who have trouble with the current price point could go sell chips at school or work a few extra chores to rack up the $5 per month. But is that really the point? I think everybody in the Auxy community is here to try to improve Auxy to hopefully become more than a niche mobile music making app, not to try to rip off the developers and get more features for themselves while paying as little as possible.</p>

            <p>I know. I meant as far as not synthesizing a wave form but allowing the loading of a wave form. A synth in Auxy (a generative synth) is pie in the sky right now.</p>
<p>A melodic sampler could load single cycle waveforms though and at least provide a functional, tweakable synth instrument.</p>
<p>This is getting less subscription related and more feature requesty lol. I know we’ve all hashed this out already though…</p>

            <p>All the basic presets are based off of very simple waveforms, with certain effects, filters, ADSR and LFO’s impacting them. There’s a few more complex ones, such as Cinema, Bumble, Blob and Twig, but the rest of them are all simple single-cycle waveforms.</p>

            <p>Yep - a melodic sampler would help here if it was considered undesirable to open up the hood so to speak.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking into wavetables and single cycle waveforms, with a very small amount of education and some decent controls they’d go a long long way. (A lot of great synths are wavetable based or at least have options for it- Serum might be one of em, I’m not familiar with it)</p>

            <p>There’s options for curating more synth/melodic instruments, and that would be allowing people to utilize the software that they use to develop their synths. It’s apparently really similar to Serum, so people who utilize that would be able to make some fantastic sounds using it. And then Auxy could pick which sounds to put into the app. As I research the way the sounds are handled myself, it doesn’t seem like it’s that complicated if people are willing to learn.</p>

<p>Sure. But let’s be real–if I had to guess based on what I’ve heard people say, most people would rather have attention focused on melodic instruments even at the expensive of some percussion samples.</p>
<p>And if it’s not possible for such a small team of developers to accomplish this, than that’s one thing. Otherwise, let’s not confuse curation ability with curation priority.</p>

<p>It’s a lot easier to curate drum samples than the synth/melodic instruments I’d imagine, for one. The drums in v4 Auxy were woefully, woefully lacking, and this fixed it. I’m hoping melodic pack content continues to stream in and that future versions of Auxy support either a melodic sampler or perhaps a small time synth engine.</p>

            <p>I wonder if folks would feel differently about the subscription if there were more to it than just access to sounds, like say, access to new app features.  Sounds are cool, but maybe more folks would jump on board the subscription train if we were getting some of that “new ways to make chords and melodies” mentioned in the raising the bar for the future of Auxy post.  Like let’s get some actual new features in here and then I’ll think about a yearly subscription.</p>
<p>I mean what’s with this weird focus on drums and percussion? Thousands of percussion samples, ambient rimshots, tweak every drum sound individually, creating kits, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I still have to trawl through the sound library painstakingly searching for a sound that has the right attack and release to gel in my mix because we don’t do ADSR round these parts or something.</p>

            <p>Maybe via a 3rd-party/affiliate, such as UNiDAYS, that verifies student status?</p>
<p>Don’t know the full details of how it works, but I know Spotify and other subscription services are available through that scheme.</p>
<p>Jus’ spit-ballin’.</p>

            <p>Usually apps or services use an email domain whitelist to determine the validity of a student’s request.</p>
<p>For example, JetBrains (an IDE developer) uses <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/swot">swot</a> (a GitHub repository of email domains) to determine eligibility.</p>
<p>You give them your school email and they send a confirmation to it. If this email is confirmed to be owned by the applicant and is whitelisted as a school domain, the free license will be granted.</p>
<p>This could be done with Auxy too.</p>
