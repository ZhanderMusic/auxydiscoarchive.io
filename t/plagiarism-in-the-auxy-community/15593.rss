    <title>Plagiarism in the Auxy Community</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/plagiarism-in-the-auxy-community/15593</link>
    <description>So I was logging onto SoundCloud today, and I saw that a guy named Aidan McJoseph liked one of my tracks. I don’t usually click on pages like this since they’re usually bots. Anyway, I decided to listen to “his stuff” and realized he stole @MrSerpent’s track “suncaster”. I commented a link to Mr. Serpent’s song, and within minutes, it was deleted. So I got curious. Turns out he stole a lot of other Auxy tracks too. He stole my collab with @Yaad, “starlight” and @Fuujiya’s song “Forest Groove”. And it doesn’t just stop there on his SoundCloud. I saw that he had a Spotify so I checked it out. He “collabed” with a guy named Asleep (which I’m pretty sure is another alias he made up) on @MR_ANDERSON’s song “The Heavens”. I notified the members of Auxy Collective about it, and we discovered that he stole “Sand Castle” by @aUstin_Haga, and some songs by @decruz and @Phluze too. 
Of course, this action isn’t right, and it needs to be stopped somehow. We noticed that the majority of stuff that was stolen was from artists that were reposted on the Auxy SoundCloud. How do we prevent this from happening in the future, and how would you all advise that this be dealt with? Something needs to be done to get this guy to remove “his” stolen songs.</description>

            <p>I get it now. Funny thing is, two weeks later I found A L E X (you) on Spotify and saw like about 4,000 listens on the song. And <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xintrix">@XINTRIX</a> has about 3,000 monthly listeners now. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/crazy_face.png?v=9" title=":crazy_face:" class="emoji" alt=":crazy_face:"></p>

            <p>Hey so to address that, we released it but the distributors accidentally placed it in the wrong A L E X and they didn’t fix it til recently. This is common for people who have the same name.</p>

            <p>it’s because if someone with your same artist name has a spotify artist page already, spotify automatically puts the song on their page. it’s not plagiarism, it’s a rather helpful accident. their song has gotten a lot of plays because it’s on that page.</p>

            <p>Uhhh. Just looked up A L E X on Spotify, and… weirdly, the song “Time by <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xintrix">@XINTRIX</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/a_l_e_x">@A_L_E_X</a>”<br>
Was on this guys account. It was the same name, and spelling. But NONE of the songs sounded like<br>
A L E X. Two days later I go on A L E X’s Account and see that the exact song isn’t there.<br>
Very weird…</p>

            <p>Posting other people’s stuff, posing it as your own, is both sad, disrespectful, and dumb. Of course it will backfire, at some point. One way, or the other, or in several weird and unexpected ways.</p>
<p>When I studied multimedia design, there was a motion design contest, in collaboration with MTV Europe: make one of those 5-20 second artistic bumpers / visual station ID’s (ending with the MTV logo).</p>
<p>There was a guy in my class who entered. And everyone at the event where they got shown and prizes awarded, were very impressed.</p>
<p>One person however, felt he’d seen it before. And before long, he remembered where, and had pulled up the link for the original – a motion design production by a well-known motion design agency.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that guy had lost my respect for the remaining years of that course. And he never, ever did anything to improve on his reputation as a copycat slacker. He was late, didn’t turn in assignments on time, did crappy work due to laziness, etc etc etc.</p>
<p>I mean… What the F… was that guy expecting? Applause? No one would notice? And even if that had been the case, how the F… did he expect it to go down, once that production began airing on MTV? No one noticing?? Applause… for his act of Grand Theft Artistry?</p>
<p>And even IF no one ever noticed: how could he ever look himself in the mirror, and say “I did good. I did well. I’m a cool person.”</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Such people shock me no end.</p>
<p>What did their parents do wrong? Drop them on a hard floor?</p>
<p>On a less serious note:<br>
If we lived in an unregulated society, I’d argue for death by disembowelment, by katana – and a very rusty, blunt one, marinated in salt (from The Dead Sea even <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">)!</p>

            <p>What do you mean? I can’t follow your line of thought. Why pity him? He’s a low-life scumbag thief, with no original thought-process in his little sheep-mind. A pathetic jerk who, with his act, pisses on the creativity of these artistic people who DO have their own ideas.</p>
<p>Few things can piss me off as plagiarism like that can.</p>
<p>But again: I’d like to understand your viewpoint, as you may have a point:)</p>

            <p>Well, I got things sorted on my end. This guy knows he made a mistake and is currently taking down the songs he’s plagiarized. Case closed <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Imma just come in here to say sorry for starting this lil’ war here in the community. I know I said this a couple time before, but PLEASE don’t be too harsh on this person. I mean, yes, please report him and DM him, but I want your encounter of a/the plagiarist to be private, not public. It was just cause an angry crowd which will be hard to calm down.</p>
<p>Trust me, I’ve been there.</p>
