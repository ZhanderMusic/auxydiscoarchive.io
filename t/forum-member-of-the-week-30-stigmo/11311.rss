&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #30: @Stigmo   &lt;/big&gt; 
 
 &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt;tigmo is from the Netherlands :netherlands: , where he sometimes drives his mothers purple Fiat Panda :panda_face:  . He played for a professional football team :soccer: when he was 13/14 and he likes beer :beer: . Hopefully not while driving his mothers purple Fiat Panda. :beer: :panda_face:  

He&#39;s also into DJ&#39;ing and performs live DJ sets.  
&gt;&quot;I usually play for 50-100 people, but I’ve done sets in a club for 500-600 people as well&quot;
&gt;

<p>I love your music, you have a really cool and distinct sound that sets you apart. I really like your electro genre songs with the pitch bendy leads and awesome melodies. Keep it up!</p>

            <p>Hey Stigmo,</p>
<p>Congrats on being our 30th FMOTW.</p>
<p>All of your tracks get my head-nodding and my feet-tapping. Your drops, transitions and automation all sound sweet-as-a-nut. You make bangers.  You’re a banger-maker.  And that’s why I listen to your tracks.</p>
<p>That initial ramp-up in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/cyborg-1">Cyborg</a>.  Man, you can feel it coming and building from miles away. Like “here it comes… here it comes… here it comes…”</p>
<p>Constructive feedback - the leads in the last six tracks all sound great, but the melodies are quite similar. If you listen to the last six tracks in a row, you start to notice how similar.  My suggestion is to drop a <em>completely</em>  different melody, just to keep things fresh.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a cool forum member too.</p>

            <p>I feel like you were one of the first people to do a collaboration with me and were super supportive when I was just getting started. I also believe your soundcloud profile was the first of the Auxy community that I started following and always get excited when I see a new post is up from you. As far as your music, they all have a super club vibe and wish I could be in a club having a beer jamming to your tunes in the background before I couldn’t take it any more and slam my beer back and hit the dance floor. Congrats on this weeks forum member of the week. Hope you get great useful or at least uplifting motivational comments. Keep making those fire bangers!</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot bro! Let me know if you find that video game which Viper reminded you of, I’m curious what that sounds like <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Concerning the bass in Sky High, you’re not the first person who pointed that out, so I’ll keep that in mind for my future tracks. Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<ul>
<li>Viper</li>
</ul>
<h1>Viper was one of my favorite tracks from you! I couldn’t think of a single thing I would do to change it to make it sound more epic because it’s already epic to the max!!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sky High</li>
</ul>
<h1>I LOVE IT!! Except maybe adding in some more bass for the drops would have made the track a bit more epic, IMO. But, overall, great track!</h1>

            <p>Congrats <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<div class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-member-of-the-week-30-stigmo/11311/15">spoiler</a></div>
<p>I’m just gonna say that you have one of the most predominant styles that I’ve seen around Auxy! Alpha, Viper and Next Level are the three tracks that would be perfect in being in some club festival, not even those, pretty much all of your tracks! <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-member-of-the-week-30-stigmo/11311/15">spoiler</a></span></p>
<p>And I gotta agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a>, your remix of Voyage is pretty awesome, I love the intro for that! And the drop was unexpected for me, but it fits your style.</p>

            <p>I feel blessed that you still consider this remix as one of your favorites. You were one of the first people here who really made me feel confident about my music, so I can’t thank you enough for that.<br>
And thank you for the kind words, means a lot! I’ll keep on going <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/muscle.png?v=5" title=":muscle:" class="emoji" alt=":muscle:"></p>

            <p>Ahhhhhhh this guy has still pumped out one of my favorite Auxy remixes of all time - <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/newnames-x-conux-voyage-stigmo-remix">NN and Conux - Voyage (Stigmo Remix)</a> LIT LIT LIT. All Auxy v4 I’m pretty sure too which is even MORE impressive.</p>
<p>Stigmo, keep doing what you’re doing - you <em>are</em> super positive, you seem like a genuinely nice dude and you write killer tracks. Keep on keeping on <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
