<p>Yup, this is pretty much where my head is at right now. The many things myself and MM have tried to keep the pulse beating around here has ranged from spectacular failure to mildly successful.

            <p>Yeah, sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to put it to you like it was your problem to solve.</p>
<p>Wondering if it might be time for a period of ‚Äòno mod‚Äô, to let it become whatever it becomes, even if that means letting it die, and let Auxy deal with it. After all, it‚Äôs a free community attached to <em>their</em> commercial business. The Auxy team are the ones with all the incentives - brand, salaries, etc‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Ä¶or maybe just have a mod or two who are keen but who ,will need to demonstrate their reliability while ‚Äòon the job‚Äô.</p>
<p>Either way, it‚Äôs not something <em>your</em> conscientiousness should compel you to worry about or figure out.</p>
<p>Those who have freely given their time and effort as mods here have gone above and beyond. Maybe it‚Äôs time for the salaried ones to step up.</p>

</aside>
<p>I‚Äôll be super transparent here - the folks I would have said were a good fit have all moved on.</p>
<p>Lenberg is (seemingly) not super crazy about having a ton of people with administrative capabilities (ie, in order to change titles to give out unicorns and discs and stuff, you can‚Äôt just be a leader - you have to be added to a specific permission/role group). Otherwise other folks can be promoted to leader and the discourse platform will allow thread closing/merging etc, but no one would be able to really drive a contest or etc in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>I approached Dadmo about it and I think real life just kicked into gear - it‚Äôs what happens. I know my time ebbs and flows, lately it‚Äôs been a struggle with work projects really starting to take off. I think he sincerely has the best intentions for this place, but yeah - life gonna do what life gonna do.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I don‚Äôt know anymore who else would be a good fit.</p>
<p>I hear ya on discord servers. Myself I‚Äôm in only two cause I just can‚Äôt keep up, and I can‚Äôt be bothered. I think the chaps over there are doing a good job though, the feedback for feedback channel works pretty well, and the weekly feedback streams are very popular. But‚Ä¶ I totally understand your sentiment lol‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>Bit confused why dadmom put their hand up for mod duties if time was v limited. Surely there‚Äôs someone else (as well as, rather than instead of) who can be trusted and is willing to carry some of the weight?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Re: Discord servers</p>
<p>Tbh, maybe my age, but I find Discord servers a bit too all over the joint, and imo, they lend themselves much more to soundbites, rather than something longer and more considered.</p>
<p>I struggle to get a sense that it‚Äôs an experience where meaningful feedback can be shared, and where meaningful growth can be fostered.</p>
<p>Not a boomer, but I certainly feel like one when I walk through those doors. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Still, maybe one more try‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm trying to distance myself from (responsibility around) here, and I know Dadmo is incredibly, incredibly busy with work and life in general, so track of the week may become track of the week it‚Äôs posted, if you‚Äôre picking up what I‚Äôm putting down.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs no secret things have slowed down around here quite a bit, for various reasons. I would point anyone looking for more interaction toward the <a href="https://discord.gg/vTsSNMZ">Auxy Collective</a> discord server. There‚Äôs weekly feedback streams, an award ceremony called the ACCAs where submitted tracks are voted on, etc. It‚Äôs also not Auxy exclusive, which is neat. There‚Äôs a lot of familiar faces over there, a lot of folks you don‚Äôt see around here anymore.</p>
