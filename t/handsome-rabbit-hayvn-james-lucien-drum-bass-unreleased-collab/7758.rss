This demo turned into a full track was created about three or so months ago, since then it had remained dormant until I recently decided to finish it in remembrance of HAYVN and her music. It always inspired me so much to be better with my own music. It brought out true emotion from me where I normally cannot write music with a feeling behind it. I fake emotion in my own music. Emptiness. But to me, this is truly the greatest work I have created, in dedication to my friend. The friend who inspired me, the friend who I argued with to protect, the one who wished me to vanish and the one who wished me to stay. For you, I finish our song. Thank you so much for everything.

            <p>Thanks! Enjoy the song, and both of the logos were created by HAYVN. She did a fantastic job on my original logo before I switched over to E/E.</p>
