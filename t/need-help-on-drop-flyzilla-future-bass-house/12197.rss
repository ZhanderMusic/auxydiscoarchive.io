    <title>Need help on drop - Flyzilla [future bass/house]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/need-help-on-drop-flyzilla-future-bass-house/12197</link>
    <description>Hey guys ðŸ‘‹. I was making this track and I came across a problem ðŸ˜¬. I think that the flutter/wub things collide with the spray saw chords in the drop. I also suck quite a lot at drops so it would be greatly appreciated if someone could help me out. 
Here is the project link https://app.auxy.co/projects/PYQANvk3I_edBjmkmLVbbg==
Thanks ðŸ˜œ</description>
