    <title>Auxy Producers Label?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-producers-label/15359</link>
    <description>Hey. I’m an Auxy user since around 2016 and only really started to make solid house/trap tracks such as “SELEKTA” or “404” under my alias: “2080-FC”.
But this isn’t about me.
I was wondering if someone, somewhere has ever created some sort of platform/label where Auxy users can submit their work for others working on the label to publish to an audience? 
I feel like a team of ppl could make this happen and it’d really benefit artists starting out. 
If you’re interested in this dm me @ 2080-fc on Instagram.</description>
