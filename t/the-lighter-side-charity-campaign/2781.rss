----------

**Dear, Auxy community:**

Today, I wish to share with you my biggest project to date... and it&#39;s not another track. This time, I&#39;m posting and promoting a charity campaign that I&#39;ve been developing for a while now. In this post, I will share with you some backstory for this cause and why it is important to me personally, and then I will tell you how you can participate and show that the Auxy community is not just about making music, but also about making a difference.

_SOME BACKGROUND:_

A little more than a year ago, I met one of the greatest friends of my life. She has changed my life in ways I can&#39;t even begin to explain, and as she has told me, I have changed hers. What you should know, however, is that she experienced a rather afflicted childhood (i.e. abuse of various kinds, a paralyzed mother, starvation, and countless, lengthy hospital stays for several health concerns), all of this while suffering from a lesser known form of bipolar disorder that causes extreme and, often times, long-lasting depression - most of the time without telltale signs or warning. Because of this, there were points in her life when she felt that the only option left was to end it. 

Since I met her, things have turned around rather dramatically and she proudly tells her story of perseverance and determination to live on and make change in the world. The two of us are inseparable (so much so, in fact, that we have tattoos to prove it).

Now, I want to do something more. I know that so many other people did not feel they had the strength to keep fighting, given their severely unfortunate circumstances. Because of this, I want us to show people facing a similar dilemma that there is, indeed, a &quot;brighter side.&quot;

This song that I wrote and produced, [The Lighter Side (feat. Tehillah Henry)](https://soundcloud.com/official_ivo/the-lighter-side), was made for my friend. However, I feel it may have significance to many others alike. 

_THE MISSION:_

Music moves us in some of the most unexpected ways. So, how can one song make such a difference for so many lives?

1. Buy the song. The track is a mere $0.99 on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-lighter-side-feat-tehillah-henry-single/id1267459749?ign-mpt=uo%3D4). And every penny spent will go straight to the **American Foundation for Suicide Prevention**. You can find their website [here](https://afsp.donordrive.com/index.cfm?), where you can find more information about _their_ mission, events, and the impact they&#39;ve made already.
2. Share the campaign poster (above) and let others know about this campaign. 
3. Lastly, feel free to provide feedback! Perhaps there is another nonprofit organization with a similar cause that you feel could benefit from some attention here within our community? Don&#39;t hesitate to grow this campaign and do more to help prevent suicide. 

I give my sincere thanks to all those who have read this far and who wish to participate. I really hope this will help the AFSP and, ultimately, those who really need our help.

Let us show them &quot;the lighter side!&quot;

            <p>It really makes me happy to see people with this type of decency on the internet. There’s is a lot of bad people online who say things they really shouldn’t. Thank you. This reminds me of Logic’s idea with song 1-800-273-8255. (<a href="https://youtu.be/Kb24RrHIbFk" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/Kb24RrHIbFk</a>) Thank you for starting this and thank everyone who is helping</p>

            <p>I am a Proud supporter now, and I support this cause with my full heartesness. I’ll gladly join in a campaign for a remix contest. Music has been my only escape and has helped me remain vigilant and strong so I myself can raise a beautiful boy who is inspired by music himself, this is the future, I stand by this with my heart and soul. My heart goes out to this beautiful person because they too may see the lighter side of things.</p>

I have no job, so I’ll mow a lawn or something and buy it for all my friends</p>

            <p>I did find it on iTunes on my phone by searching exactly “IVO The Lighter Side” if that is any help at all. I’m sorry for that inconvenience. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Apple does make this difficult.</p>

            <p>It seems the only way to purchase it is through iTunes on a computer. I’ll be able to do that later tonight at least. Another disappointment by Apple… ugh &gt;|&lt;</p>

            <p>I’m of course having issues with Apple Music and not finding it anywhere to purchase. Figures this would happen, I’m gonna keep looking around and once I find the link to the actual iTunes Store and not their Apple Music shenanigans I’ll link it.</p>

<p>I’ll post the link above as well. (Being that I’m nowhere close to being a popular artist on iTunes, I understand it’d be difficult to find haha) Thank you for letting me know <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>As someone who’s girlfriend suffers from bipolar disorder with psychosis, I understand completely. I’m buying the song twice right now, one for me and one for her. Thank you so much <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xavior">@xavior</a></p>
<p>Edit: I can’t find the song on iTunes anywhere</p>
