    <title>Auxy Community: Thoughts/ Auxy vs. Other Music Production Apps</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-community-thoughts-auxy-vs-other-music-production-apps/16377</link>
    <description>Does anyone feel like the Auxy community keeps emptying up. I left Auxy disco and took a break for a year or so and now many of my old friends and favorite producers seem to be gone (Ex. @anon73773654, @decruz, and more). I feel as though other producers are moving onto more complex apps such as ableton, but I can‚Äôt seem to make the transition myself. Is it time to do so? Or is there something new that is drawing the attention of producers now? I just want to know what people think because it makes me really sad when I see people‚Äôs last posts were in like 2018 and I never said goodbye. ‚òπÔ∏èüò≠</description>

            <p>learning anything new always takes time and doesn‚Äôt feel great at first</p>
<p>giving up is probably the worst thing you can do here</p>
<p>also, if you‚Äôre not happy with certain features in the app, talking politely to the devs directly will probably go a lot farther than complaining in numerous threads about the same issue‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>I can relate, but it‚Äôs not that bad. I know the sounds don‚Äôt sound as full or smooth, but the overall idea is more advanced in a way. On the other, i need to research distortion to understand how to shape my sounds the way I want which is disappointing considering tone and shape were easier to work with.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I‚Äôve talked about A6 within the Auxy Collective Discord and through Disco for far too many times, it‚Äôs a real chore that I have to keep venting my frustrations with it.</p>
<p>First of all, the update would‚Äôve been great if my old projects weren‚Äôt completely F()()()ed by the new sounds. Little did I know, the new sounds don‚Äôt sound nearly the same as they used to back in Auxy 5.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve talked to other people within The Auxy Collective discord about my situation and they had the same problems I‚Äôm facing; the automation screen feels too loose to even get creative with, and even if we were to get creative, it takes an exponentially longer time to make the same pattern compared to A5</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no way an amateur user can understand what these DAW terms mean without a visual. I‚Äôve complained about this during the betas, and mentioned about it when A6 was first released. I strongly don‚Äôt like the approach where you have to figure it out since you don‚Äôt have a clear understanding on what half of the new settings are, which ultimately kills off a person‚Äôs creative flow. I believe this how a DAW fails, especially when it‚Äôs towards a mobile market, expecting to help teach people what Sineshaper, Clip, or Bitcrusher is.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, this update is extremely beneficial to those who are familiar on how to use a proper DAW like Ableton, Reason, FL Studio, etc. But Auxy was what helped me get a basic understanding on what some of the terms used within the EDM community, terms like Sidechaining, Distortion, Delay, Reverb, etc. Now it feels like what happened when people reacted when Auxy 5 was first released when no one was expecting the app to be subscription based and locked users out when they don‚Äôt pay up for even the most basic instruments, even as going far as removing the ability to use the original sounds if said user doesn‚Äôt have the subscription.</p>
<p>What I‚Äôm saying is that I‚Äôm extremely fed up with the update, especially because I feel destroys creative flow rather than helping users create the kinds of music they want to hear in the present or the future. I‚Äôm done using Auxy until future notice.</p>

            <p>first of all, the majority of people here produce as a hobby, which Auxy is perfect for. I think that most of the time when people disappear/become less active here, it‚Äôs because of other things in their own lives getting in the way of producing. usually producing isn‚Äôt the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> priority, especially here, where most people just produce for fun</p>

</aside>
<p>when people change DAWs, that in no way means that they are leaving the community. I am a perfect example of this. I used to use Auxy exclusively and I was a very active member of this community. in February, I switched to using FL Studio and I have achieved much greater success with it than I did with Auxy, but I‚Äôm still very active with this community, maybe even more so than I was before</p>
<p>overall, I think that the Auxy community is a place for anyone who enjoys producing, or music in general. changing DAWs shouldn‚Äôt be a reason to leave the community</p>

            <p>Omg, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon73773654">@anon73773654</a>‚Äôs back! I thought that considering your last post was in 2018, there was no way you would see this conversation. I‚Äôve very much missed your production. I think there is an immense pressure to make new tracks that impress people, and maybe that is your goal, idk. I think production can be done just for fun even when the end product doesn‚Äôt sound as good, unique, or special as I think it should.</p>
<p>I think that part of production is having times where we have trouble producing. That‚Äôs why most of my tracks come in small groups after a few months. I usually have stagnant periods and then I get inspiration to make a few complete songs that I post, and then I‚Äôm back to looking for inspiration. Hopefully, you could get onto Auxy sometime when you‚Äôre bored and just play around. Make a track or two in your spare time.</p>
<p>People probably didn‚Äôt miss me when I stopped posting for like a year, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve missed your presence on this platform and SoundCloud. You don‚Äôt have to get back to production but I just think it would be nice! Anyways, I‚Äôm glad you saw this post and it‚Äôs reassuring to see that better producers than I have times where they struggle to produce as well.</p>
<p>Last thing, I know this is a super long post. Should I join Auxy Collective in discord, and if I do, how do I join? (I don‚Äôt currently have discord and have no experience).</p>
<p>If you decide to make some time for fun production, I‚Äôll be there to listen and support! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/star.png?v=9" title=":star:" class="emoji" alt=":star:"></p>

            <p>don‚Äôt feel bad, you‚Äôre not a bad person at all! i stopped regularly posting music because everything i tried to make sounded either bad or similar to something I had already made before, partly due to to the fact that i hadn‚Äôt renewed my subscription. i didn‚Äôt want to keep paying for it because i felt there were other hobbies i preferred and i couldn‚Äôt spend 5 dollars on the app every month.</p>
<p>that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve stopped using auxy though! i do still try to make stuff and while i honestly haven‚Äôt had much inspiration as of recently, i might eventually finish and post something <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>‚Ä¶ but yeah, i still listen to stuff &amp; repost on soundcloud</p>

            <p>So in the interest of keeping things on topic, is this about the community or other music apps?</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an ebb and flow of people. Some faces are new, some are old, and some people just move on whether it‚Äôs because they are using other apps, or software, or maybe just don‚Äôt feel like keeping up with an online forum because real life gets busy? Just my perspective.</p>

            <p>Yeah ik, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anirudhkhanna">@AnirudhKhanna</a> do you know when <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon73773654">@anon73773654</a> left? I feel bad because she used to be one of the friendliest people on disco to me. She even replied in most of my few conversation that I started. Wish I had replied back. I feel like a bad person, but back then I just wasn‚Äôt used to replying to people‚Äôs individual responses one by one. I changed how I use this platform, but now I have to come to terms that it‚Äôs too late to be nice to all the people I selfishly ignored back then. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cry.png?v=9" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt=":cry:"></p>
<p>Btw, that was like 1 or even 2 years ago, RIP<br>
I thought <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon73773654">@anon73773654</a> left about a year ago or 10 months. She did repost recently on SoundCloud this month so that‚Äôs a good sign.</p>

            <p>Do you know much about Medley? I remember using it in the past but I think I quit because I felt Auxy was more clean and capable.</p>
