&gt; 8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only

            <p>Not cancelled, as such.<br>
It‚Äôs just that changes in the Mods team means that there‚Äôs no-one really set on ‚Äòrunning it‚Äô from that side any more.</p>
<p>(iammane previous handled it, but he‚Äôs stepping back from his role as Mod here.)</p>
<p>The community could arrange and run it itself, but it possibly/probably wouldn‚Äôt have the little pay-offs such as badges next to user names.</p>

<p>By default, this goes to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yeahmarcyeah">@YeahMarcYeah</a> - I‚Äôll say this though, normally no feedback or reasoning is provided here, but, I think stepping out of your comfort zone was a good choice here, I like what you‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs definitely not your usual style, and pushing the envelope worked out well. This definitely has future bass overtones, not my usual bag, but you approached it with a pop sensibility that makes it more accessible.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay here, I have no idea where Serp is so I‚Äôm stepping in. I‚Äôll update the hall of fame shortly and dispense the disc.</p>

<p>I really pushed myself to create something totally fresh and different on this one - and less of the ‚Äúchill/nostalgia‚Äù thing I normally do.</p>
<p>For me to create a new sound, I actually took inspiration from <em>you</em> guys here in the Auxy community. I listened to a bunch of yalls stuff, and put my own spin on it. I‚Äôm pretty happy with the way it turned out <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/2.png?v=9" title=":+1:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t2:"></p>
