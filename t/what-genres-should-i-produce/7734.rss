        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well there’s this cool genre that’s been around for a couple of centuries. Mozart pioneered it by mixing futurebass, dubstep, trance, trap, house, lo-fi, hip hop, lo-fi hip hop, and moombahton.</p>
<p>He called it sp00pus McBoopus.</p>
<p>Only a select few producers are able to produce sp00pus McBoopus, and those who do must take a perilous quest.</p>
<p>Start by serving a feast of caesar salad, tomato soup, and squashed onions to Lenberg and his family. If they rate it a 10/10 on the richter scale, you’re good to advance to the next step.</p>
<p>You’ll then have to move to Australia. Make sure you find a stable income, house, and all the necessities before you move on. Become acquainted with your surroundings and relax to enjoy your first few weeks in Australia. Those who live in Australia can skip this step.</p>
<p>Once you’re all settled in, locate where Southborne lives. After a nice supper, he will lead you into a mystical cavern, which will curve beneath the ocean and all the way to New Zealand. Dodge the stalagmites and enter the chamber. mistermaster, mister moo, mister serpent, and mister otszil will jump out and start throwing cheese at you. After about 10 blocks of cheese bounce off of you, you will be teleported to New York.</p>
<p>Find shelter and sleep your way through the night. This is possibly the hardest step because of the nightmares that will storm your brain as soon as you close your eyes. If you don’t sleep through the night, your quest will end and the genre of sp00pus McBoopus will die.</p>
<p>If you’ve managed to sleep, you’ll find yourself on a subway in new york. On the chair next to you will be an industry city sleeper. Check the time on his watch. 4:30 in the morning, yikes.</p>
<p>Get off at the third stop and walk out of the station. Walk up to the first 19-year old Lousianian you see and say the phrase, “I wish there was an AP that had screams of the dead as sounds. They’re so pleasing to the ears.” He will nod and touch your left elbow, teleporting you to Germany.</p>
<p>Walk through Berlin until you see a young man in a silver jacket. Ask him where to find the Haven and he will point his finger somewhere in between Northeast and Southwest. Take 100 steps in the direction he points at and sit down, cross-legged. A red ghost will appear and tell you a secret.</p>
<p>This is the final step. After you hear the secret, fly to Austria. After you walk out of the airport, go to a music museum. Head to the Mozart exhibit. Inside the exhibit there will be a couple of Swedish programmers. Tell the secret to the one with the beard.</p>
<p>Congratulations. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-genres-should-i-produce/7734/9">spoiler</a></span></p>

            <p>Yeah, keep in mind to make it really melodious btw. From the lo-fi I’ve heard, it’s usually mainly chords. As relaxing as that is, EDM needs a lot of upbeat melodies. It may take some time. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
