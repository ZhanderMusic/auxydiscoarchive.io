    <title>Vulture - Winter J. Studios [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/vulture-winter-j-studios-wip/15300</link>
    <description>Hey guys! So... I need some feedback on what you all think of this track. 

I’ve put together one of the new spooky sounds that Auxy created today, and it sounds really cool and trap genre themed. 

I also put the track link if you would like to here it for yourself or even help collaborate with the project. Thanks a bunch!
