    <title>We All Know - Just Chill (POP/House)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/we-all-know-just-chill-pop-house/17014</link>
    <description>This track is supposed to give off a happy vibe, and perhaps the melody will get stuck in your head ðŸ™‚
It is also meant to have a poppy feeling and give off a feeling of relatability. It is meant to represent how something is so close to being perfect and it falls just short of the bar.
