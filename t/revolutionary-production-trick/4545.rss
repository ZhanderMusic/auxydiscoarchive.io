    <description>revolutionary for me, anyways

so i had this idea around an hour prior to posting this, and testing revealed better results than i had expected

https://app.auxy.co/projects/q_r8bQXV79B6bemk8DR5lQ==

this is a project with four tracks. the first loops hold the same test melody. the second ones are where i applied the trick.

this idea was born from some boring sound science about overtones. how the trick itself works is that the melody is raised by an octave, and then a perfect fifth above that (13 and 7 spaces in a chromatic loop respectively). the effect, with most sounds, is the instrument sounding more “shimmery,” for lack of a better term, demonstrated in the Corn loop. for some reason, certain sounds don’t work with the trick, as shown in the Owl loop. some sounds, the two i found being Gravel and Stress, react strangely to the trick, producing new sounds entirely.

hopefully this information is useful to you, or even comes up in your tracks.</description>

            <p>What scale/mode is the melody in? Is it dorian with a raised fifth in the second measure of the loop? Sounds pretty nice <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>I’ve been using Stress like that for a while. Turns a good sound into an even more interesting sound.<br>
Maxing out the Tone on Stress results in (what seems like) self-modulation, producing something akin to a ‘metalizer + distortion’ effect.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the sounds were likely designed to offer these possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Btw, good loop. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
