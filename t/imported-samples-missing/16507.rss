    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/imported-samples-missing/16507</link>
    <description>Well i hopped onto auxy and noticed all of my imported samples are gone and a lot of my songs from this year had imported drums and other sounds. all the songs that had imported samples are effected because the sounds disappeared so, the only thing that plays are just the melodic components which are base auxy sounds. Now i have to reinstall all those sounds i had and try to replicate what i had.</description>

            <p>Hey! We think we have found a bug that could potentially clear the imported sample folders in very rare cases. There will be a fix that should hopefully prevent this in the next update so stay tuned and keep reporting if it happens again! Also, as always it’s better to send us an email (“contact support”) whenever something like this happens so that we get log files and can follow up properly. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Have you by any chance moved around the folders that the samples are in? I rearranged my icloud drive to get it more organized and I ended up messing up all the samples. If this happened, you can try to relocate them again using the option from the drum kits and find them in whichever folders you have.</p>

            <p>I downloaded this app called “Mega” to install the samples and from mega i imported them to auxy. I haven’t deleted the app or anything, and my imported folder is just gone too.</p>

            <p>Could you elaborate on how they were imported? Are they still precent in your imported samples folder? Did you recently delete and reinstall the app?</p>

            <p>It’s worth sending an email through the app or just reaching out to <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a> directly. From within the app also attaches a log which is helpful I’d imagine:</p>
<p><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/5/50bfdf086e35b092e5f4eb6015f20eba879dc659.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bwlhlGhfikXgu13LmzeuAnjaVPr" width="231" height="500"></p>
<p>Also, if you are talking about samples that are stored in iCloud (ie, iCloud/Auxy/Samples folder) it’s worth checking to see if they look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/7/7993ab7facac8a27f416d6ac8f7328eea8798f9d.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hlw9CPk5uqI30zgBsv2NVNwjyt7" width="231" height="500"></p>
<p>If they have the symbol to download then I don’t know if Auxy will be able to find them or not. I don’t know how long it takes but iOS offloads iCloud Drive stuff you haven’t used in awhile (it deletes it from local storage but can just be downloaded from iCloud again). Good luck and hope this helps some</p>
