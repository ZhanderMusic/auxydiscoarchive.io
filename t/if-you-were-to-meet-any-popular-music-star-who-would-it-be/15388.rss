    <title>If you were to meet any popular music star, who would it be?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/if-you-were-to-meet-any-popular-music-star-who-would-it-be/15388</link>
    <description>Hey guys! There are a lot of celebrity music stars out there! I want to know, who would you desire to meet? If you would rather vote then I will figure maybe even a contest! 
My music star I would like to meet is either Alan Walker or Jon Bellion.</description>

            <p>lmao oof. i remember that.</p>
<p>But i will say that Alan Walker probably definately has a ghost producer judging by the Alone walkthough.  The guy was clueless on pretty much every aspect of the track and didnt seem to really know the plugins n software he used.</p>
<p>I dont think he can’t produce (he had to get signed somehow lol), just that he is forced to let others produce the whole track because of his contract.<br>
Some people have noted some subtle differences between Fade [before signed] and Faded [after getting signed].  Faded was probably remixed/remastered by some professionals to have a more professional/clean sound.</p>
