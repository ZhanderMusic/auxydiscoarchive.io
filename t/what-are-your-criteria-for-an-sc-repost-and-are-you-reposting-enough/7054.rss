    <title>What are your criteria for an SC repost? (And are you reposting enough?)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-are-your-criteria-for-an-sc-repost-and-are-you-reposting-enough/7054</link>
    <description>Recent observations have made me wonder if, as a community, we are reluctant to Repost a track, even if we think it&#39;s particularly good, and if so, why?

&amp;nbsp;
**What are your criteria for giving an SC Repost?**

&amp;nbsp;
[details=&quot;Why am I asking?&quot;]
**Note: this thread is not about trying to get more Reposts for any of my stuff. Really.**

&amp;nbsp;
So I posted a track on SC (and here) three days ago, which has received a some _really_ positive comments from some here.

It currently stands at 90 plays, 22 Likes – and 2 Reposts.
Tbh, the number of Reposts disappoints me a little, given how good some of the feedback has been. But, mostly it surprises me.

Comments like _&quot;Awesome&quot;_, _&quot;Amazing job &lt;3&quot;_, _&quot;Great track!&quot;_ and _&quot;Just Perfect!&quot;_ simply haven&#39;t translated into Reposts.

I&#39;m not saying my track is unusual in this way. Just got me wondering if we, as a community, are reluctant to Repost a track, even if we think it&#39;s particularly great – and, if so, why?

            <p>Sure, there’s aspiration in there, and comments which point to me wishing that this community was more willing to support each other more proactively – for greater mutualism. Y’know, suck up a little discomfort to help someone else, because they’ll do the same for you – and you never know where your breaks are gonna come from.</p>
<p>(I’d certainly like to encourage that, though tbh, when so few here ‘get it’, I’m not sure it’s a good use of anyone’s time and effort to push for it.)</p>
<p>Either way, you are mistaking those comments as me fundamentally challenging member’s right to define their own criteria for reposts. You are mistaken.</p>
<p>As I said, stuck on semantics.</p>

<p>However, I will instead once again ask you to either be satisfied with the feedback you do get, or don’t, but regardless understand that even though the Auxy community is a tight knit community, people still have standards that they adhere to when it comes to showcasing other people’s music.</p>
<p>It seems like you won’t see eye to eye on this with a lot of the community members here, so rather than saying that what is being portrayed by you is unintentional, try to speak with your actions and really absorb the feedback that you <em>are</em> given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet you essentially say that you are devaluing the value of a music community,</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I’ve given that impression, it’s unintentional.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><em>I appreciate all feedback given</em></span>, and I think the way that I respond to feedback on my music is evidence of that.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I give feedback to others, I try to go a bit deeper, <em>precisely because I recognise and appreciate the value of feedback</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you really accepted people’s reasons for not reposting your tracks despite it being “worthy enough for one”, you would not be questioning the value of other forms of support and leave the fact that people don’t repost as much as you think they should / want them to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know how much more clear I can be that I’m not challenging their reasons for not reposting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
It’s a simple fact that not all forms of support are of equal value. While <em><span class="bbcode-u">all forms of support are welcome and have value</span></em>, some will naturally be more desirable than others.</p>
<p>Reposts hold a premium value as they can actively help expand an audience — which is something that (presumably) everyone here wants for themselves. On top of that, they are especially appreciated as they are an attempt by the reposter to actively help expand someone else’s audience.</p>
<p>I think we’re seeing how rare that is, even within a music community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps my frustration is that this is a loose community based around a shared interest, when in fact, what I would perhaps liked to see happen in this community was more <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/post-writing-and-production-tips-links-embeds-only/2333/17?u=akabillposters">collective</a>-like behaviour, with a greater sense of mutualism and desire to help each other the ladder.</p>
<p>My aspirations for this community are simply out of whack with this place. That’s on me. No-one else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
So, the answer to the question ‘So what now?’ might be ‘somewhere else’.</p>

            <p>My problem with you and this entire post is that you keep contradicting yourself. You say that you acknowledge people’s reasons for not promoting you for free (reposting), yet you essentially say that you are devaluing the value of a music community, if assigning it any value at all, simply because they give all forms of musical support except for a repost.</p>
<p>If you really accepted people’s reasons for not reposting your tracks despite it being “worthy enough for one”, you would not be questioning the value of other forms of support and leave the fact that people don’t repost as much as you think they should / want them to.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Appreciated.</p>
<p>Again, this thread really isn’t aimed at that. I’m just using my own situation as a case study to raise a question.</p>

<p>:sigh: So, it would appear that you <em>are</em> misunderstanding the point, as I thought.</p>
<p>The fact that some users don’t and won’t repost is clear – as are their reasons. Those are simply the facts — <em>and I’m not contesting them.</em> Neither am I challenging their right — or the correctness — of their choices.</p>
<p>You’re misunderstanding my statements, taking them as challenges to their decisions.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">At no point in this thread have I attempted to assert that people are wrong to have the criteria they do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em>The question has moved on.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The question has evolved, becoming <em>‘What value is there (in a music community) for someone who has produced a worthy track when others won’t repost (for a range of reasons)?’</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
In basic terms, <em>‘So what now?’</em>.</p>
<p>If the answer to that question is ‘nothing’. That’s a valid answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Again, to be crystal clear, I’m not expecting the answer to involve getting people to change their attitudes towards when they do or don’t repost. That’s off the table — <em>and I’m fine with that</em>. Clear enough for you?</p>
<p>If the ‘what now?’ question is not something you want to respond on, that’s fine. It’s not directed at you specifically. It’s an open question.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your concern. Regardless of whether or not the thread was originally unnecessary, it can safely be deemed as unnecessary at its current state. Many people have given him their insights as to why they are more reserved with reposting vs other kinds of music support, and my slight issue seems to be that he still doesn’t understand despite this (which is why I provided a comprehensive summary).</p>
<p>Neither of us said it was against the rules, nor did we say we were going to take it down. Nor did we try to “instantly strike other people”. If you’re going to portray us in a certain light please do it accurately.</p>

This thread might not be necessary nor needed BUT.You thinking that this thread is unnecessary is nothing more than an unneeded comment.HE wanted to see why people didn’t want to repost other peoples posts.If he wanted to he can make a thread about anything he wants unless its not good with the rules or unless the MODERATOR thinks its unnecessary and takes the thread down not you guys.What im trying to tell here is stop trying to instantly strike other people by their minimal flaw or unimportant stuff.Stop.</p>

            <p>You continue to ignore the feedback given on this thread that you claim to seek out. I suggest that you re-read the comments left here so that you can better understand where people are coming from. I will summarize what I interpret to be people’s viewpoints on reposting atleast in the Auxy community:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a difference between commenting that something is good and listening to it, and taking up a spot on their own <em>personal</em> profile with your track.</li>
<li>Some people who enjoy your track don’t feel that it is their style of music that they produce, and therefore don’t repost it.</li>
<li>Certain people don’t repost tracks period, whether it be to keep their soundcloud profile “cleaner”, or to highlight their own tracks more without cluttering it up with highlights from other people’s music.</li>
<li>Reposting can be viewed as a type of free promotion for whoever is reposted. That’s not something to necessarily take super lightly. It’s why huge promotional SoundCloud accounts exist. Individual Auxy users can be viewed as a “miniature” version of that.</li>
<li>Sometimes people like your song enough to give you a like or a comment, but not enough to repost it. That’s just a plain and simple fact.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also note that growing your audience does not involve tons of reposts (while it can involve it, it’s not necessarily true.)</p>
