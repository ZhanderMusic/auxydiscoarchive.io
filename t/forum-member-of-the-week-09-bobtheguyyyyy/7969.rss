    <description>&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #09: @BobTheGUYYYYY   &lt;/big&gt;

![5439e5910a4b22c74bff021e11a6a8d465b0b95f_1_499x500|499x500](upload://5sflQZOQclc8HSyXl35KzUjQ12I.png)

&lt;big&gt;BobTheGuyyyyy &lt;/big&gt;  is a forum regular from America.  A top contender in the [rapping thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-game-the-rapping-thread/6590), he plays drums and describes himself as:  &quot;a mediocre auxy user, but I have fun with the app.&quot;  His love of Video games influences his music, with arcade themes featured in his tracks. He&#39;s also a guy with five Y&#39;s in his name.

&gt; &quot;My beats are fire, my beats are bright
&gt; My beats be burnin’ at 700° Fahrenheit
&gt; Yet every word from your mouth is so lame,
&gt; I almost forget this is a [Forum game].
&gt; Of any game, it’s like a game of thrones
&gt; I’m sitting on platinum and you’re sitting on bones
&gt; So step it up or get out the way,
&gt;  Cuz I’ve taken my roots and I’m here to stay.&quot;
&gt;

            <p>BobTheGUYYYYY, I enjoy your stuff. I do think sometimes you should focus more on your own tracks than remixes. Keep it up!</p>

            <p>Sorry, been busy, now started to listen your stuff.<br>
Just listened 5, and I really like it!<br>
I’ve been waiting for these type of orthodox and groovy beats made by Auxy.<br>
I will listen more of your works. Keep up <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Great music! I’m especially impressed by some of your drum patterns, they’re really cool. The piano in As Light Fades is also really good, and the track itself is chill, good job <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

<p>Very nice buildups, unique drum beats and sounds, good use of delay and reverb, and great drops! Overall 9/10 ! +Follow</p>
