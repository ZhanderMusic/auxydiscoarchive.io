    <title>Have you ever made a track in Auxy with only samples?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/have-you-ever-made-a-track-in-auxy-with-only-samples/12016</link>
    <description>I’m intrigued has anyone done this? I use a fair few samples in my tunes but I’ve never created a song from just samples and none of the Auxy instruments.</description>

            <p>I’ve probably only ever used up to 40% samples. I’d be interested to see if I could make a track with 100% samples.</p>
