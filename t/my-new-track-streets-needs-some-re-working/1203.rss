    <title>My new track &quot;streets&quot; needs some re-working</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-new-track-streets-needs-some-re-working/1203</link>
    <description>Anyone down to collab to help me finish this new project of mine? I think this can really be a good track, but it&#39;s either missing something, or it needs something taken out.
Thanks for the feedback guys!

            <p>I don’t know if needs that much work other than perhaps shortening some sections that repeat one too many times, etc.  but everything that’s there is real solid and you have a great vibe going. Really enjoyed it</p>

So I tweeked a few things but overall your song is great. Let me know what you think. (I added some ducker to the drop chords, reduced shape on coin in non drop parts, and reduced filter on dollar in some areas.) Very chill song.</p>
