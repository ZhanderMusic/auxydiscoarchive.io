            <p>It’s really good and full of flavour and I have no complaints at all except for the intro and end.</p>
<p>The intro felt drawn out a bit before the sound modifications kicked in. If they played a bit sooner it would be a much better start. Adding an ambience to it in the start also is very beneficial.</p>
<p>The end was also great, with the orchestral instruments blending in with the electronics, but the ending felt abrupt. I didn’t expect for the song to end there.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s amazing and flows through perfectly.</p>
