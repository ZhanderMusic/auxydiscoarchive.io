[Night Club Showdown](https://soundcloud.com/plhector/night-club-showdown)
FINALLY FINISHED WITH THIS TRACK! It took me a couple months—not being it was a complicated track, but because I was focused on other tracks while making this one. Anyway, this will probably be the last track I upload this year. Enjoy! :&gt;

(The reason why the drums are kinda sporadic is because it’s suppose to be like a fight. You don’t really know your foe’s next move.....unless you’re really good. The kick and snare are representing punches or attacks in general.)</description>
