    <title>Tie Dye Third Eye - Breezymode [Future Bass]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/tie-dye-third-eye-breezymode-future-bass/11744</link>
    <description>hey everyone! I dropped my new song: Tie Dye Third Eye today. I cant express to the forum enough how impactful it has been to be a part of this. I would not be growing as an artist without such a tight knit community. I worked my tail off to make this track as good as it can be, i hope you like it :)

            <p>This song definitely opened my tie dye third eye.</p>
<p>Very weird and funky. Not sure if I would call it future bass, but at this point Idk what future bass is.</p>
