So. The bizarre thing here is that Panopticon Flow is currently private, yet it was played. Has anyone else experienced this?</description>

            <p>Ahhhh and the permissions were allowing that, so maybe maybe, that makes sense. It’s all good will go back to normal this Friday anyway, just thought it was weird</p>

            <p>Wondering if it might be someone who has SoundCloud Go/Go+, which allows for downloading for offline listening. Possible someone grabbed it for offline listening when it was public, played it today and it still registers as a new play.</p>

            <p>I’m always logged in though, I don’t think those plays count. I didn’t anyway though… very bizarre. It’s not a huge deal, it’s just weird haha</p>

            <p>They were public yeah… I’ve set to private because I replaced all the audio files with re-mixed (not REMIXED, but just more carefully mixed) and finalized versions. I don’t think I’ve ever shared the private link with anyone <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fearful.png?v=5" title=":fearful:" class="emoji" alt=":fearful:"></p>

            <p>Has it ever been public?<br>
Also, I’m not sure this shows plays or not but do you have private link sharing on?</p>
