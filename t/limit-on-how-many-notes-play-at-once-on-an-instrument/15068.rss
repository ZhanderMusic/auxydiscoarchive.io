    <title>Limit on how many notes play at once on an instrument</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/limit-on-how-many-notes-play-at-once-on-an-instrument/15068</link>
    <description>This may sound like a bit of a random, off-the-wall question, but something I’ve been noticing is that there potentially is a hard limit on how many simultaneous notes can be triggered at the same time on a single instrument. Has anyone else experienced this, and perhaps @Auxy could potentially shine some light on whether or not this is indeed the case?</description>

            <p>Well frankly it’s just fun to spam mono synths with notes to see what kind of whacky sounds come out.  You may get a nice surprise.  It’s really not necessary.    Now as for live recording,  don’t not do it.</p>

<p>If you are frustrated with Auxy you should consider not using it instead of nagging us about how you want things to work. Every person has a different view on what should be added and not, so if you’re just feeling frustrated the app is probably not the right choice for you.</p>

            <p>:\</p>
<p>It’s <em>why</em> I <em>do</em> use a DAW, and why I get so frustrated with Auxy all the time. I want to see Auxy be the best it can be. Options like this only add and enhance the experience, and they don’t take away from it. I get that you want to keep it simple, and I do appreciate that, but there’s a certain point where Auxy can do so much more and be so much more amazing because of it and I don’t always feel that interest from you. I’m sorry if that sounds rude, but it’s how I feel about it and I don’t know how else to express the frustration I sometimes feel.</p>

            <p>Indeed! Although we have a thing we call “auto note off”, which is a setting that is enabled for a lot of sounds, especially basses. It does this exact thing, i.e. cuts off any tail of the previous note. So it’s the best of both worlds. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Monophonic instruments function a bit different than this. If a note has any release, it would be cut off by the next note in a monophonic setup, which is a good thing in some instances depending on the use case. It’s sort of like the instrument is its own choke group, to give some practical context.</p>

            <p>There is some “smart” voice allocation that limits the number of simultaneous notes, yes. This is necessary and hopefully done in a way so you won’t have to think about it. Did this cause any actual problem for anyone?</p>

            <p>Thank you for showing this, this is exactly what I was talking about. I’ve been rather busy the last few days so I’ve been sort of ghosting things, but this is exactly what I meant when I posted this.</p>
<p>Something I’ve noticed is that even though it appears to be doing this, actual audio seems to show a bit of a difference, leading me to think it’s a visual glitch rather than an actual limitation. I have to try and experiment more.</p>
<p>As a side note, a way to make instruments <em>mono</em> as in no polyphony and each note is cut off by the next, would be a cool and useful addition.</p>

            <p>It’s something Lenberg should answer. Knowing the voice limit of the software one is using to make music is normally reported by its developers.</p>
<p>I know the polyphony of all my VST softsynths, and hence make choices as to which one plays what. I don’t use my u-he Repro 5 (Prophet-5 emulation) to play thick chord progressions / pads, with 7th chords + extra root note in the bass (i.e. 5 simultaneous notes/voices) with long release times, as that will always result in voice stealing (which I find to be a 100% unacceptable practice) – I use my VirtualCZ (32 voice polyphony) for that. And so on.</p>
<p>Overall, Auxy’s secrecy / opaqueness regarding its inner workings can sometimes frustrate me a bit, tbh.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think there should be a limit to voices per instrument, in Auxy. It should simply choke and display a message if one is overloading it too much. Just like video editors often report “frames were dropped during playback”.</p>
<p>If one wants to make a a simple song with a hugely stacked viola instrument playing 15 notes simultaneously – and their device handles it fine: I don’t see why Auxy should limit it.</p>
<p>Afterall, Auxy IS remarkably efficient, CPU-wise. On my iPhone 7 Plus, I’ve pretty much maxed it out 100% when I did Auxylate (a track I posted “Finished Tracks” the other day) without any problems – and often even in Low Battery mode:)</p>
<p>At least Lenberg should answer it succinctly / concretely. And write it in Auxy’s specs / description and Help docs (if there is any… I’ve never needed it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">)</p>

            <p>I can’t recall which exactly, but I’ve noticed this in the past with a few specific instruments.</p>

            <p>Hmm. That’s not good. 10 isn’t much for it to stop playing notes already</p>

            <p>How many notes is it before it locks out? sometimes I’ve noticed it not outlining the notes but they are still audible, and sometimes flickering in and out of the settings while a note is playing causes the note to stay highlighted longer than usual. I do think this issue could be fixed by an option in the settings for how many notes can play at a time for an instrument using a bar similar to the tempo bar.</p>

            <p>This is a somewhat unscientific test, but a sixteen note chord <em>appears</em> to only play ten notes…</p>

<p>Also, looks like higher notes get preference when voice stealing.</p>

            <p>I think that kind of depends. I’d say probably not - usually a voice limitation is imposed on the hardware level or at the synth itself. We’re not talking about offline rendering being better (more capable?) than live playback for something with a really complex effect chain that you’re trying to listen in real time with low latency… Voice steal will voice steal no matter what I’d think.</p>

            <p>It could have been just in playback, but renders would be fine</p>
