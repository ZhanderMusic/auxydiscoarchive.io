&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist / Janitor #13: @xavior   &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;IVO&lt;/big&gt;  is a Germany-based artist who loves Moombahton and Minimal Techno. His track [Civil Disobedience](https://m.soundcloud.com/official_ivo/civil-disobedience) was apparently the first track ever featured within the Auxy App. IVO later took on Southborne in the popular battle-track [Even Louder](https://soundcloud.com/official_ivo/even-louder) and hosted Beat the Clock #20 with the &quot;Heavy Drop&quot; challenge. More recently, he released his album [Structure](https://disco.auxy.co/t/ivo-structure-album/7393) which took several months to produce.  He uses his own photographs and artwork on covers and is a janitor (moderator) for this forum, while also doing his studies. 

**What&#39;s IVO stand for?** 
Doesn’t stand for anything really :man_shrugging:t3: 

**Describe your sound?** 
I’ve found three key elements in the majority of my tracks that make up my signature sound:  A slow tempo, a prominent bass line, and piano.

Check out IVO&#39;s music and leave some feedback! 

**Week starting: 26 Mar, 2018.** 
- Please listen to at least one of their tracks (or more) 
- Provide at least one Soundcloud comment / feedback about their music during their week.

Where to start… You’re definitely one of the most well-known auxy producers, and rightfully so. I love your style man, it’s really energetic, yet you also experiment with more relaxed tracks. You really nail those bass-heavy tracks and classic deep pianos (both in buildups and drops) which are characteristic for your style. If I had to choose my favorite tracks of yours I think those would be Mothership, Blink, Lazarus, Montezuma, Even Louder and Ra; yes these all have dem big drops I like <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">. Also Dream Within A Dream is so good, it’s so well crafted, it’s pretty different from what you usually made but it’s still your style. Everything you release is pure quality, so please continue this way.</p>

            <p>I love your works since civil disobedience. Their simple but strong distinctive base lines, dark piano sounds always facilitate me.<br>
Also, your works are getting more sexy these days… I don’t know “sexy” is the right word, but your song is not only cool, but also glamorous. Your last album is one of them.<br>
Plus, you did lots of collaboration which is why I love IVO. You enhance your and the collaborators’ potentials through each collab, I reckon. Even louder is always my favorite (your voice is so sweet), mothership is freaking cool, and Lazarus beats perfectly matches with songs.</p>
<p>Look forward to your next song.</p>
<p>PS. Love your photos as well. People look so attractive in your portrait.<br>
Love the black and white style.</p>

            <p>Lazarus and On The Road are two of my Favs.  So good.</p>
<p>Your tracks work really well with vocals / raps.  Perhaps the slower tempo’s allow room for vocals?</p>
<p>Strangely, I only noticed the frequency that you use slow tempo once you pointed it out. Because your tracks don’t feel “slow.”</p>
<p>Piano-work is “cool” and edgy.</p>
<p>Words that come to mind:  High quality, unique, polished and piano.</p>
<p>IVO music sounds authentic. Not just reproducing a genre. Feels more “artistic” than that.</p>
<p>Not scared to wade into more taboo topics / language, but without being vulgar or offensive.</p>
<p>Your Album ‘Structure’ is a real achievement, with months of working with others to deliver on your vision.</p>
<p>Obviously one of the most popular artists in the Auxy community.</p>
<p>Look forward to checking out your new VLog once it’s out.</p>
<p>You recently used the word “Loon” in a sentence!?!</p>

            <p>I’d like to add that you went above and beyond in adding effects to your songs, even before Auxy 5 came out. It’s obvious that you spend time on your music and artwork, instead of just releasing it as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Ok.</p>
<p>Mothership can I just first say is an awesome name. I love the mysterious feel to this song. The chords fit right in with the feel. I love the sample at the beginning. The voice of the man is so perfect. I love the mysterious piano because it doesn’t sound traditional, it sounds kinda glitchy. These samples are awesome btw. They really add to the song. That drop is SO AWESOME! Everything about it from even the drums are top notch professional. I love it! I also love how it isn’t all just the same, with a tiny bit a variation in the second half which is what I’d do. The short bit of piano after the drop is a perfect transition. And omg those drums after that are just amazing the way you used pan and pitch on the snares is amazing. I love them so much! The piano after that imo doesn’t really fit into the song, but it’s actually fine because of the background noises. OMG THAT SECOND DROP IS SO LIT!!! There are so many elements to this! Just… HOW DO YOU DO IT? That was so awesome! An amazing song. At first I didn’t like the guitar at the end but I actually really like it now because it kinda feels like peaceful now the song is over. Amazing. Just amazing. I loved it.</p>
<p>Structure is awesome, I really like it. The peaceful breathing, the intro makes me want to go to sleep. Who is that singing? Those vocals are nice. And also how did you get delay on those vocals? Did you play the sample twice and make the second one a lot quieter? Anyway, that melody afterwards is awesome. This song sounds really professional! That drop is awesome. These drops in your song are not really my style of creating so I don’t know what elements are good or bad but I listen to some similar stuff when I want to, so I enjoy listening to it. The vocals are just so awesome! I love the… um… I think it’s climb? Or something from 7 skies I think. Once again the drop is awesome. I love the pitch. The piano after the drop is really emotion sparkinging. It reminded me of the first nine years of my life when I lived in the UK. That ending sparked SO MUCH emotion. It brought tears to my eyes. My favourite so far, let’s see the next one.</p>
<p>That intro is really nice and groovy. Not too repetitive, I didn’t get bored. I love how you do things with sounds which I would never have thought of. This isn’t <em>really</em> auxy community friendly but I don’t care. I love the beat and the background sounds to go with the rapping. The way you added the vocals is so professional. I love how it isn’t a really dark song, like when the rapper says haha nah just joking. That part when the rapper raps really fast is so cool! Not really much to say about this because the vocals are the main part of this song, and I have already given my feedback about that. Great song!</p>
<p>Lazarus is another song with vocals which is awesome. I love the detail in the background of this song. I love how the vocals include your names like In professional songs… bot that your songs aren’t professional but you know what you mean. I love how Lazarus sounds before the second drop! How did you do that? These songs are not really my style but I like them. My feedback on them isn’t the best as I have literally no idea which I’m saying with this.</p>
<p>Ahh, don’t save me. One of my favourites from your album. The kiss (I think it’s kiss) at the beginning is awesome. There is so much going on already! It’s hard to tell what’s what and give feedback. But then that drop is simplistic but awesome! That bass is heavy. Not really my settle again but awesome. That impact after the drop is really cool. The piano goes right in with the song, and now there is less going on I can realise how cool those chords are. Your style is just so different to mine so it’s really hard to give good feedback! That song was pretty cool though. Really professionally as always. Good job!</p>
<p>Blink has a nice start. Not really my style again but really cool, it feels mysterious. That sample is so awesome, and that drop is heavy! I love that you used piano in it. You like heavy bass don’t you? That melody after the drop makes me feel weird! I don’t know, it just makes my body feel funny… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> did you use subway? I like it if you did! I like for the second sample you didn’t just use the first. Awesome. That drop is heavy again, and has nice piano again. The piano melody in the second half is awesome. Not much else to say… except that the drums have been really amazing in this song. The ending is also amazing. Well done!</p>
<p>I’ll stop there. Your tracks are amazing. So professional. And the drums and bass in them are epic. My favourite was structure. Keep on producing, you are amazing! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Love the atmospheric feeling of mothership. Matches the theme so well! I also love the speeches you add, reminds me of <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/moemx">@moemx</a>. You Germans have that in common. But it’s so awesome. What is it called?</p>
<p>Also you are one of the most unique people in the Auxy team. With wobbling basses and slow moving tracks. And hard hitting drops. You da man!</p>

            <p>I’m a fan of your vocal tracks, especially <em>Apologize</em>. The drums there are well done and not too complex, and the piano parts are breathtaking.<br>
I generally don’t like bass as much, but your songs are done in a way I can appreciate.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

            <p>You probably already know this but here we go:</p>
<p>I’ve been a fan of yours for more than a year now, ever since Civil Disobedience (RIP) was featured in the Auxy feed, I’ve been following your soundcloud since at least summer 2016 <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I really enjoy your music, especially <em>Lazarus</em>, Even Louder_, <em>Montezuma</em>, and <em>Ra</em>. I love the deep dark bass and piano as well as the moombahton drums. Keep it up!</p>
