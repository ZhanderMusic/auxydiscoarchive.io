    <title>Shimin - From Home to Sydney (debut album)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/shimin-from-home-to-sydney-debut-album/18099</link>
    <description>Konichiwa! I am Shimin, a Vietnamese singer-songwriter currently based in Sydney and been an Auxy user since 2017.

I actually released this album last July, 2019 but not until now am I able to make a post about it.

So the whole album contains 10 tracks which document my study abroad experience in Sydney, thus it is a bit personal and maybe not very relatable. But I would appreciate it if you guys could give me some feedback as I used AUXY to produce some of the tracks (3, 6, 9) on the album.

Give me a few cents by listening to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4F3BwP1m0NRYh5GKb4Qulx?si=cq7dV_qQQs-B-gBxpq_lMw)

or it&#39;s public now on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/danshimin/sets/from-home-to-sydney)

P/S: I love to swing on here and listen to may of your works, which give me so much inspiration and motivation!</description>
