    <title>Paper Airplanes in Zero Gravity - Digital Dumpster Fire</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/paper-airplanes-in-zero-gravity-digital-dumpster-fire/10166</link>
    <description>up until about 2 and 1/2 years ago, I had never even remotely experimented with creating music in a medium like this. 

I had (still have) no clue what the hell i was doing, but over a period of 20+ months, I worked over 120+ collective hours working on this (and one other) track. 

an incredibly large portion of that time i attribute to me, learning my way around the program and figuring out how to manipulate the sounds provided. 

Please take the time to give this a listen, and make sure to wait for that drop. 

(and if there is an issue with posting a youtube link as opposed to soundcloud, i apologize, i didnt see anything saying not to do so.)
