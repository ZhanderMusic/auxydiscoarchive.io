    <description>Hey guys, I have never been one of the more prominent Auxy producers. I have always tried to lay low in the things I do, but I just wanted to announce my updated SoundCloud.

https://soundcloud.com/zephsound

I made a lot of my first songs public, updated artwork, made a new banner, and reuploaded newer versions of my tracks. 

I have been making music for almost two years now, and I think it would be amusing for both of us to listen to how I started haha.

It feels like around half a year ago, my music jumped in quality and I was comfortable making things I liked. Now, I am delving into new genres and styles that I figured you guys would enjoy listening to. I truly appreciate every play I get :)</description>
