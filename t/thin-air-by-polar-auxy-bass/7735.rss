    <title>Thin Air - by Polar [Auxy Bass]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/thin-air-by-polar-auxy-bass/7735</link>
    <description>Finally got a new track out. I remember working on this song since before Christmas, idk why I took so long on it, but maybe that&#39;s a good thing because imo this is my best. Please give feedback, and I would appreciate some likes, comments, and/or reposts!

Also, what genre is this? I made it in the attempt of chill trap, but it came out a little future bassy. I still think its chill trap but what do you think?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>I usually have no clue about genres, so I can’t tell you anything. This is a really great track though. Good job!</p>
