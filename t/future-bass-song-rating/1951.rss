            <p>i think the drums could use a little more, if you know what i mean. overall tho im D I G G I N the chord prog, and maybe a more distinctive bass. also, id completley cut out the silk (no volume) when it is just the stress playing (0:43), and slap a shxtton of reverb on the stress during that section.</p>

            <p>8/10 everything was amazing except for one thing. If you have can hear it, there is dissonance with the bass line and the lead in the drop. But keep ip the awesome work! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p>Use less shape on the silk to make the wubs more defined.<br>
Second verse is great.<br>
Drums could transition in better tho.<br>
Overall decent.<br>

            <p>I rated 8 because I really liked it! It was very chill! But one option to be more appealing is to have a snare, it doesn’t have to be very hard hitting, but I feel having a drop with a thumpy kick and a snap doesn’t satisfy me. I get you wanted to keep the vibe but a clap with a tiny bit of sidechain (ducker) would sound legit. Song was amazing nonetheless. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
