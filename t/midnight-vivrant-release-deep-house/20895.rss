    <title>MIDNIGHT - Vivrant release [Deep House]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/midnight-vivrant-release-deep-house/20895</link>
    <description>Everyone has given their spin on the Sound of Vivrant pack; I figured it was my turn to put my spin on it with modern day auxy elements. 

Me and my dad listen to a lot of Eric Prydz and Jeremey Olander&#39;s music and I feel like this is a pretty good combination of the two. I don&#39;t primarily post on soundcloud as much as I should, but I&#39;ve been pretty active on spotify. 

Let me know what you guys think of Vivrant

            <p>Not my genre, but nice vibe.</p>
<p>Kinda wish you’d created a sequence in there that made more use of the growling bass (e.g. 1:37).<br>
That sound brought a nice alternative vibe into it. Might have been nice to explore that for a mid section.</p>
<p>Either way, Liked <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
