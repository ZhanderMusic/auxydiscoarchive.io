    <title>What was your first track EVER?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-was-your-first-track-ever/5274</link>
    <description>I know there is already a topic which says your first Auxy track, but I’m talking about what was the first song you ever made (online or in an app).

Just post a link :smiley: Here’s mine: 

https://soundation.com/user/DeliEatsAHotDog/track/fortronic

I had changed my name to LimeZ just because I wanted to :P (My first name was Trasx, then DubbTrasx (which was my SoundCloud for a while), then others like Jetpack, Venomous, and then...Delphi, and...well I had a lot (don’t post your previous names [if you had any]).</description>

<p>I don’t have access to my first ever(which was almost 10 years ago <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/scream.png?v=5" title=":scream:" class="emoji" alt=":scream:">). But here’s one I made in 2009-10 back when I was rapping and making crappy beats for my crappy raps(Fair warning <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/warning.png?v=5" title=":warning:" class="emoji" alt=":warning:">️).<br>

            <p>This was the first song I ever developed further than a loop in Auxy (it’s still just 1:20 long lol…). I made this approx 10 months ago, and then when I made a Soundcloud account I decided to upload it (no idea why though lol).<br>

<p>Long before I made music as IVO, I worked under the alias “Razemm” - This is the first track I released on soundcloud. Embarassing? Maybe. However, I can’t find it in me to delete this account. So, feel free to peruse, make fun, enjoy. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

            <p>I know there is already a topic which says your first Auxy track, but I’m talking about what was the first song you ever made (online or in an app).</p>
