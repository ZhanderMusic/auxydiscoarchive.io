    <title>Lost Beauty - By Chiroto</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/lost-beauty-by-chiroto/12789</link>
    <description>This is my new track. It speaks (to me) about loss, loneliness but also nostalgia and optimism.
Kind of a sour and sweet feeling. Inspired by so many different musicians and the loss of a friend.
