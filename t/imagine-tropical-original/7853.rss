    <title>Imagine - Tropical Original</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/imagine-tropical-original/7853</link>
    <description>Hello everybody! This time time posting a song that isn’t on my album. This will be a regular song for everyone to enjoy.

Thanks to Bradley Saint James for putting the five sounds in the track. I edited the sounds if you were wondering. This is more of an ambient genre themed music. It sounds very nice when listening to the song.

Here’s the track!

Soundcloud: [Imagine - Tropical Original](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/imagine-tropical-original)

If you would like to do vocals please hit me up with a message and I will see what I think. I’ll be doing vocals myself soon. For now this is the instrumental part. 

Have a great day!</description>

<p>It’s honestly whatever you prefer!  I made them to help give inspiration and I didn’t expect any recognition from them <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>Your call, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/tropical_madman">@Tropical_Madman</a>!  The shout out in the description is good enough <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

            <p>I personally think this should be labeled as a remix, because you are using the same melodies as in the project, and not your own. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/bsj">@BSJ</a> What do you think?</p>
