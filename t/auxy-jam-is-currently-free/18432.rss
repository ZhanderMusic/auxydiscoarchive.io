            <p>For me the best thing about Auxy is not having to deal with the endless tangle of midi connecting on iOS. There was a time where I would have liked it, but with almost unlimited sampling ability now, it is very easy to record parts in other soft synths or whatever and import them into the Auxy workflow as samples.   Another thing I do is export the Auxy tracks as wave files into Auria, and then I can start building on them with basically anything I want via overdubbing.</p>

            <p>I was playing around with the original Green Auxy,  and I have to say I miss lemon as well as wind. Also, as I noted elsewhere, the filter sweeps are much better in this than the main app.  The live workflow is better for jamming out ideas I think, the main Auxy studio is better for detailed composition.   I don’t know, but the ideas I get with the simple version or different than the ones I execute in the main version. Both have their advantages.  I still like it enough that I maintain it on an old iPad running iOS 9  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I am suspecting the reason why many sounds have not reappeared is a licensing issue. Call it a hunch, but it would explain why so few of the sounds made it out of Auxy Classic into the initial Auxy 1.0 app, then why even more sounds got dropped when moving forwards (namely drum kits). Also, the developers tend to clam up whenever a licensing issue comes up, so that could explain why they’re unwilling. Why be upfront when it’s outside their control after all?</p>
<p>Also, to be honest, Auxy Jam is highly lacking in any strong saw-based synths at the moment. It further devalues the app, especially with the removal of MIDI functionality, which was a feature I wish I had gotten to try on the old app and one that I’m sure I could now make use of.</p>

            <p>Yes, Wind was the best sound for pads, you could almost get vocoder like voice out of it too… So bummed that it’s not in Auxy jam or Pro…  I thought the idea was to keep some soundsi exclusive to the original Auxy, but now that it’s been left out of Jam, can we please add it to the main Auxy music ?</p>
