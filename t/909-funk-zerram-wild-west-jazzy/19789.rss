    <title>909 Funk! - Zerram [Wild West/Jazzy]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/909-funk-zerram-wild-west-jazzy/19789</link>
    <description>Hi, this is my first song that I&#39;m posting in this forum.
https://youtu.be/lOSbJzuRd0I
I will copy and paste the video desc. that tells you about it:

*I made this song with the main drumkit being the 909 Dirt kirt. I have a bit of 808 clean for the fills every four bars as well. The bassline is sort of an echo of the high Wild West sound that I have going on with the bright horn. (I think it&#39;s a trumpet or a trombone), which you can hear starting at minute 0:16*

*I kept it very minimalistic with this one, with only one loop per track (although they all also have two or three automation loops as well, due to the break). I hope you like it! ~Z*

Please give me feedback and suggestions and stuff.
Thanks!</description>
