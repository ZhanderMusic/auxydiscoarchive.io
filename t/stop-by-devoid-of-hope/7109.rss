            <p>Nice though, yeah I think you’ll enjoy the sample import and the sample tweaking options are definitely expanded. Good to see (hear) ya though! Hopefully things have settled down some</p>

            <p>This track is pre update, just ran it through a bunch of pedals in GB. I just updated it last weekend but haven’t gotten to in depth with it yet, but I’m excited to mess with the drum modulation now, maybe I’ll actually use the drums more often now.<br>
But yeah, I’m feeling delay and reverb heavy these day’s, so expect some heavy mellow drone stuff As per usual. Kind of bummed I haven’t had time to make anything recently.</p>

            <p>Heyyyy! Yesss very nice. Updated version of Auxy? The built in sampling would be of very good use to you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As always, insanely heavy and rhythmic. Very nice sir</p>
