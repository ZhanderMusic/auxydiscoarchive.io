    <title>Obex G- “No Fear!” Megacollab!</title>

Hey everyone! This song is based on Shakespeare’s NO FEAR reference. 
I got inspired by reading a chapter book about him talking about what it’s like to have no fear. 
Which is rare. Because we all fear. But the way he said it on the book was so emotional and real. 
It was really cool.

This will be part of my new album I will be releasing! Everyone who participates in the Collaboration will get an even amount of payment for the money we get from the song. (That will probably be sorted through PayPal)

Here are a few tips:

1. If you haven’t Collaborated a lot, maybe this will be a chance to really show what your passion for music is! 
2. If you don’t want to collab, hey! That’s ok! You can always give feedback and tips to the song! 
3. Please no vocal samples. If you have any questions, please dm me. 
4. This will be open to public. So you can make some edits even if you haven’t even seen this thread yet! 

Also, thank you to Auxy. You guys really inspired me to some songs from the demos. 
I’ll give you equal payment when I release the album. 

Thank you everyone!</description>

            <p>Well, it’s not necessarily a future bass song, it just has some stuff that sound like it.<br>
It’s more like a Valid song. But it does have some future bass in it too.</p>

            <p>This is pretty cool! It sounds like it could be turned into a really good future bass song with a bit of tweaking and maybe a faster BPM</p>

            <p>First of all I want to say this could be the foundation of an awesome track, however I have only been producing seriously for a year now and have never done an orchestral track like this and don’t feel I could do much for it. Good luck anyway!</p>
