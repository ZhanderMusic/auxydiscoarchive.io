    <title>After Rain - Bacs</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/after-rain-bacs/18140</link>
    <description>I finished this track just yesterday. I was playing around with “Crude” from Martland Guitars Pack. I was trying to learn how to play Guitar in Midi form which is fun learning with Auxy App. And added in some tweaks and deep bass in throughout the song. I actually did two bass form which it did a perfect fit especially in the chorus. Vocals from the old pack. I’m still debating whether this is gonna be the final version which I did a uploaded one demo before the this one but im quite liking the outcome. Hope you guys like it. Send me some feedback btw :slight_smile:
