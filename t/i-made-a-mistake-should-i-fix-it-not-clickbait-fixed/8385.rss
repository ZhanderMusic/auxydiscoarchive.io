    <title>I made a mistake, should I fix it(not clickbait)(FIXED)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-made-a-mistake-should-i-fix-it-not-clickbait-fixed/8385</link>
    <description>So as many of you know, one of my albums just got into stores. I found an error in one of them(silly me, should&#39;ve triple-checked), and now I&#39;m wondering this:

Do I leave the messed up song in stores or do I take it down** and re-upload? Is it worth it? Will anyone care anyway?

The error is in the second drop of Memories. See if you can find it. Did you care? 

Anyone else struggle with perfectionism? *is perfectionism a struggle*

**I would have to take down the entire album
EDIT: A friend convinced me, imma do it</description>
