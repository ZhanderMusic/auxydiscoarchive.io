    <title>Question about Imported samples, filenames, etc…</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/question-about-imported-samples-filenames-etc/19521</link>
    <description>Sorry to @ you @TheRealJFalc @iammane, but you might be the most able to answer…

&amp;nbsp;

The *&#39;Imported &gt; From iCloud&#39;* folder only has one level. i.e. every sample imported from iCloud goes into a single folder.

&amp;nbsp;
Scenario:

I start a project, and look for a kick in my own iCloud Samples folder/library. I add a kick called &#39;Kick_1.wav&#39;. That &#39;Kick_1.wav&#39; file gets imported into the *&#39;Imported &gt; From iCloud&#39;* folder.

Correct so far?
&amp;nbsp;

Later, I start another project. I import a different kick from a different iCloud folder, but it&#39;s also called &#39;Kick_1.wav&#39;.
Because it has the same filename, when it&#39;s imported into the *&#39;Imported &gt; From iCloud&#39;* folder, will it overwrite/replace the &#39;Kick_1.wav&#39; that&#39;s already in there?

If so, does that mean that the previous project will now be using the newer &#39;kick 1&#39; sample, because it&#39;s overwritten the previous &#39;Kick_1.wav&#39; that was in the  *&#39;Imported &gt; From iCloud&#39;* folder?

&amp;nbsp;
Reeeeally hoping that&#39;s not how it works.</description>

Could you possibly explain the process?</p>

<p>That’s what I do. Organised around my own preferences.<br>
Could be more organised, but it’s better than scrolling past 5,000 neurobass/brostep/etc… samples. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I’d never been in the <em>Imported &gt; From iCloud</em> folder until today, and it made we wonder.<br>
I’ve never knowingly ‘imported’. I just assumed it simply referenced the file in my custom iCloud folder.</p>
<p>Never thought too much about the process underneath.</p>
<p>So, I’m now assuming that all samples/files sourced from your own iCloud folder get imported to the <em>‘from iCloud’</em> folder automatically, and stored in the app’s local storage.<br>
Looking in there now, I’m not seeing signs of custom suffixed to avoid overwriting — e.g. <em>Kick_1 (1)</em></p>
<p>So, either I’ve been very lucky so far, or it’s simply overwriting — and there’s a good chance that Auxy has silently been screwing up my Auxy projects for quite a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’ll try to do a test to confirm soon, but if that’s the case, that’s pretty bad.</p>

            <p>I never used imports enough to know whether or not this was a thing. Only things I ever imported were things from other users for other projects, and a weird sfx thing. That’s honestly about it. Naming conventions never were an issue.</p>

            <p>I never tried importing file names with the same name, I’m not 100% - my guess would be it would overwrite it, <em>or</em>, it may rename “Kick_1” to “Kick_1 (1)”… I’d be willing to test but can’t. The best bet I think would be to not use the imported from iCloud folder, but make folders divvying up your sound types.</p>
<p>The way I always handled this was to just do a final project export from the main menu (which DOES include samples) and then clean everything out when I was done. If for some reason I was gonna swap out a sound in a project with samples included I’d do it and then just export the project again (plus overwrite original).</p>
<p>In all fairness, a lot of other apps behave like this (single level folder). Cubasis 2 comes to mind, though, they fixed it in C3! So, it’s not impossible.</p>
<p>Given the way things work (how I remember at least) I always just try to keep Auxy app sandbox as clean as possible.</p>
