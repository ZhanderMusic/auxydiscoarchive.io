    <title>Heartless - Zeph (4th addition to album)</title>

I don&#39;t have a name for the this type of style, but it has trap groovy drums, strong melodic lead, interesting future bass chord progression, and a dark drop.

I currently have 7 other songs that I am planning on releasing in the near future for my album that are somewhat similar to this song and the previous 3 songs I have posted on my SoundCloud, so stay tuned! They are a deviation from my current future bass style, but I hope you enjoy them.</description>

<p>Uniqueness: 9/10<br>
Predictability: 8/10<br>
Complexity: 9/10<br>
