    <title>Question about one of my Albums</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/question-about-one-of-my-albums/1399</link>
    <description>So, a few months back, I released an album called &quot;Night of the Neon&quot; on SoundCloud, which consisted of all the original demos in the older version of Auxy. So I was wondering if it&#39;s okay to completely rename it to &quot;The Auxy Riot Remixes&quot; and change the song names and cover images, just to avoid copyright. @Auxy</description>

            <p>I might actually rename it to that, because that sounds like a good rename!<br>
But we’ll wait and see what <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> says first</p>
