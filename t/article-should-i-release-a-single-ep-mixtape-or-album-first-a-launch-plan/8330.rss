            <p>I’ve been looking at this thread, and as I’m concerned, it’s a godsend. I have been wanting to release an EP for a long time now, and now I have better understanding of what an EP is and how it works. Thank you for the post, OP!</p>

<p>Yeah shoot, I mistyped I meant regularly. And everyone is going to have a different “regular”, which is cool. I’ve noticed that when I’ve posted stuff every two weeks or so there’s constant activity on the whole catalog. I used to just upload a full album or EP or whatever at a time, and people would listen and then that’d be it.</p>

<p>That’s the thing that concerns me.</p>
<p>From the reading I’ve been doing in recent weeks, I’d say it’s better to release regularly, though not frequently/rapidly. A steady trickle of releases.<br>
The key would be to put proper effort into promoting each release to give each one a longer shelf-life and better chance of getting the kind of traction that can start to build and sustain growth.</p>
<p>I still plan to analyse the release patterns of artists/bands that I admire (within similar genres) to glean whatever I can from their lead.</p>
<p>If I give it a good shot, but the best I can achieve means that I have to release something new every 7-14 days just to stay in the minds of an audience, then, tbh, I’ll probably ditch the idea that this will ever be more than a hobby.</p>

            <p>I’m torn-</p>
<p>I see the value in releasing standalone and rapidly. But for something of more a “concept,” or theme related, I see the value in something like an album or EP.</p>
<p>The landscape has changed very much in even the last twenty years it feels like. The album/EP still holds weight (to me at least), but everything feels so disposable it seems like a steady release of singles might be better.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s not really a <em>right</em> answer. I think I’m just thinking out loud now…</p>

            <p>It’s worth noting that opinions vary, especially it seems about the value of EPs and albums.</p>
<p>I was watching a vid in which a guy was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg1IsA19e7A">talking down the EP as a format</a>.<br>
(He seems to equate putting your music on Spotify as giving it away for free.)</p>
<p>I don’t actually agree with his thinking or his conclusion. I think he’s simply failed to understand the value or their potential role in the scheme of things – and failed to understand how Spotify works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
To my thinking, the value of an EP is that you can drop a small range of tracks early on to both establish a consistent ‘sound’ in the mind of the listener, but also to increase your chances of one of the tracks resonating with the listener, while you have their attention — hooking them into your audience.</p>
<p>If they stumble on you via a track in a playlist, then you have a selection of current tracks for them to then go and check out.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you release just a single, and you don’t land that listener on their first listen, then that might well be your one chance spent. They might never stumble on you again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even so, he still produced a vid series about releasing EPs, though I’ve not checked it out yet.</p>
            <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLOXWqQ91GCOsxelFZ7o2KkoybSXQc62aH&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=1&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation">
            </iframe>

<p>(Incidentally, he’s in the rock genre, but presumably there’s enough general info to be useful to electronic music producers.)</p>
