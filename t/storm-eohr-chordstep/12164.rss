    <title>Storm - eohr [Chordstep]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/storm-eohr-chordstep/12164</link>
    <description>So I got the free trial for Auxy and now that I have all these cool sounds it was possible to make something slightly more outside my genre and comfort zones without working any harder than if I had made a song in my style with the sound packs I had before now.

All that probably didn’t make sense, but here’s my new track, Storm. Have fun listening and let me know what you think!
