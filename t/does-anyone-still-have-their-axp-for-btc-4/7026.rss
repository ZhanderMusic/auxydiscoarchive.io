            <p>Yeah but doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t do anything for the BTCs. I think them having a host saves time from listening to every entry, but they still do a lot of technical work</p>

            <p>I’m theorizing they are waiting until a week after the update to make sure people have time to get ready with the new update to host a BTC, otherwise people would claim that beta testers have an unfair advantage.</p>
