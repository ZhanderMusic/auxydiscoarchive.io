            <p>I really like the track art. I think the two instruments at 50 seconds that come in are too chaotic and I maybe would have suggested only bring one in at a time… I think it works better at 1:23 because the instrument sounds much different. At 2:20 ish I like the calm outro you have. The last twenty seconds are bang on, I think too many artists don’t have a good end to their songs. You do here. Hope that helps. Fun listen. Thank you. Again, love the track art</p>
