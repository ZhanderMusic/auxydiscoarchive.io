    <title>What does a star on a soundcloud profile mean?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-does-a-star-on-a-soundcloud-profile-mean/6392</link>
    <description>I have seeen a few producers that have stars after their names on soundcloud. For example, @Auxy and @blackocean. Do you know what this means? Does it mean they have a lot of followers or are good at something?</description>

            <p>I have Pro (not unlimited). Like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blackocean">@blackocean</a> was saying, more upload time and detailed stats. Now, you may be wondering, why someone like me would have it. I’m glad you asked (seriously I’m bringing this up because I wish I had known this sooner <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"> ) The SINGLE reason I have it is because you can upload updated versions of tracks without reposting, so you don’t have to delete and repost when you hear those little issues you want to fix after posting. There was one time awhile back when someone reposted one of my tracks and there were some comments, and I was so honored. And then I realized the kick was too heavy on certain speakers so I deleted it and reposted, and lost all that. Pro is great for those who have that OCD-like drive to make your tracks perfect. It’s $7.00/month.</p>
