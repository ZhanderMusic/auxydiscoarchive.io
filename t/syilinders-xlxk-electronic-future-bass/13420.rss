            <p>Cool track! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Not too much a fan of the chords before the drop, they don’t seem to fit very well as a progression. The beat is nice, but very repetitive. I don’t mean to sound super critical, but the track overall seems like you were playing around with the piano roll, not like there was very much inspiration or feeling to it. The mixing isn’t bad but maybe play around with chords and melodies some more to find a good progression.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
