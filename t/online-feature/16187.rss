    <description>Wouldn’t it be cool if there was an online feature that allowed multiple people to work on a project at the exact same time? I feel like it would make collaborations so much more easier. What do you guys think?</description>

            <p>what about live jamming right so people together decide what they do , so I believe that making it easy to find out who is doing what , in what key and all that so I believe making it very easy and clear is good , like a game where you play as a team you can still play the game on your own but for It to work you would need to talk . I feel like making music with someone should be like a conversation you take turn but it is easy to do, so I feel a app that makes it easy to send the ideas back and forth like a messaging app so you make something and you don’t link it you just the new model</p>

            <p>On paper, it seems like a good idea to collab with other people through one file, but depending on the amount of people you have, that’s straight up impossible.</p>
<p>You can only have 20 total layers and majority of that’s going to be used for layering.</p>

            <p>That would be awesome, but really confusing/hard for the two or more people actually working on the project. I believe there has been an in-depth discussion of this idea on a different thread as well, if you want to check it out.</p>

            <p>Would agree. First off, the framework for making something like this works sounds like a nightmare. Would rather see more features in what we have (open ended synthesis, audio loops, performance fx, midi input etc).</p>
<p>There is an app called Endless I think, it’s in beta… and it’s a similar idea except people work on a project and stack layers to build a project. All I could think was what happens really when it goes totally sideways? It’s not like a text doc and even on those platforms you can see where people are working - how would I know what scenes or knobs someone else is using??</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think it’s live yet, but apparently Audiotool is getting this functionality. Sounds like a nightmare lol.</p>

            <p>Right, I’ve collabed with other twice and it’s much better if we have some form of communication like Discord as we already have at least one Auxy-themed Discord server.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t seem like it would be that useful either. Music is a lot different than a text document. And a lot more complicated.</p>
