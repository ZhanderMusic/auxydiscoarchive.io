    <title>4 Hour Auxy Only Beat Tape - brandnaqua [Youtube]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/4-hour-auxy-only-beat-tape-brandnaqua-youtube/12355</link>
    <description>I started using Auxy last year around June. I compiled all that i’m made so far. Good, well mixed tracks, works in progress, wacky volume 12 second concepts, full 5 min tracks, alternate versions- EVERYTHING that i’ve produced in Auxy up to yesterday and it came out to 4 hours, 9 minutes, and 38 seconds. I will take Auxy to the mainstream charts. Can’t even get 10 views, but I have faith things will change for the better. I layed the foundation. Some of these tracks will become albums, some will be cut, but none of this would’ve been possible without Auxy and of course God allowing me to find such an amazing tool/online community! ❤️ Can’t wait to record vocals and put out videos!
