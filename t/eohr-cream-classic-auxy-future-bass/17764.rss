    <description>Hello Auxians!

I&#39;m back again, for a while. I&#39;ve been quite busy this year and not had as much inspiration/motivation to create, but I finally managed to finish some music I&#39;ve been working on for way too long. This track is a collaboration with my good friend Jack, who sent me a few chord and drum loops. I worked on them and fleshed out a full song.

I hope you all enjoy it.</description>
