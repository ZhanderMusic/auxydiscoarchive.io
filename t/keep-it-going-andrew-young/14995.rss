    <title>Keep It Going! - Andrew Young</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/keep-it-going-andrew-young/14995</link>
    <description>I used loops from Odd Makeup by Rob Martland, Euphoric Memories by Airbase, and the Destiny sound pack.  There&#39;s also a sweeper effect at the end of this track.  https://soundcloud.com/andrewyoung300/keep-it-going</description>
