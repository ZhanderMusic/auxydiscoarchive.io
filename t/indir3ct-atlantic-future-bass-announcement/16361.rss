    <description>Hey yâ€™all! First things first, hereâ€™s the link, lol 
https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/atlantic

My premium subscription is coming to an end and I donâ€™t know exactly when I will renew it, and IF I will renew it. This semester I will be starting college and will have a pretty full plate. I will still try to stay active and help out around here. And please, feel free to send me any of your tracks, or WIPs. I donâ€™t mind, spam as many SoundCloud links as you want, Iâ€™ll need something to listen to during the school year ðŸ˜‰ 

Also, if you havenâ€™t check it out yet, about 2 month ago I finished my very first album, [Resonate]! I would love for you to check that out. (https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/sets/resonate)

My soundcloud profile only has 14 public tracks, but I have a bit over 50 posted tracks and projects. If you want to listen to an older song of mine, you can check them out on this [Playlist](https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/sets/old-tracks/s-0fCyW). Also I have a little Alt account that I am fairly active on, you might be able to catch an old WIP or project on there in the near future. The accounts name is [Heniel](https://soundcloud.com/heniel).

Right now Iâ€™m going to focus on the community, and promotion. I really want to focus on building a real following with artists who share the same perspective and love for music as I do. Thank you all for your help with my journey so far. Stay tuned, so much more is to come. 

Ciao! ðŸ‘‹</description>

            <p>Bruh, college at 16 is definitely genius level if not prodigy level. Most people start at 18. If youâ€™re extra smart they start at 17.</p>

            <p>Thanks man! Donâ€™t know if I really qualify as a genius though haha<br>
Because of my birthday being in October, I turn 16 halfway in the first semester, instead of going into the semester already 16 lol.</p>

            <p>Shouldnâ€™t that make you 16 tho?  Iâ€™m on the early side of school too (college at 17).  Even if you were on the younger side of school ages, shouldâ€™t that just put you one year younger unless u skipped 2 years?</p>
<p>But I guess youâ€™d know yourself better than anyone else lol.  Thatâ€™s pretty damn impressive tho headed to college so early.  Guess I was right calling u a genius.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all your support guys! And yeah, Iâ€™m still only 15. My birthday is in October, which is a weird time that kinda throws off when you can start school when you are younger. However I got tested out when I was 4 and got into Pre-K a year early.</p>
