    <title>ONE HUNTER - rebranding</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/one-hunter-rebranding/15496</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

I&#39;ve been a bit absent the past few months due to school, and these few months away from production have led me to explore new music genres.

I&#39;m switching up pretty much everything. I am now &#39;skyswimming&#39;, and I will be producing lofi/chillhop beats primarily. I have some tracks in the works, but I&#39;m not up to full speed at the moment due to school.

I&#39;ll be back soon!

Thanks for sticking with me, and any feedback on the new logo and banner and stuff is very much appreciated!

            <p>It’s getting old and stale, at least to me. Whenever I do rebranding, it’s more of a brand evolution than completely abandoning everything.</p>
<p>Real talk, I’ll <em>always</em> be tornait. I can’t think of another name to change to…</p>

            <p>Why does everyone seem to think it’s a good idea to completely abandon their old identity and rebrand themselves…? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_facepalming.png?v=9" title=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":man_facepalming:"></p>
