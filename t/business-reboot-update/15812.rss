    <title>Business Reboot // Update</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/business-reboot-update/15812</link>
    <description>As of June 1st of 2019, I have begun, or is thinking of doing, a reboot. This means that I will do a restart upon the management of my music producing business. My second ep, “Summ3rX”, releasing in stores upon early August, will help me set up this restart of my career. Am I saying I will change my name once and for all? Most likely, yeah. But the change is going to be minimal, since the only names I will be changing will be on streaming websites like Spotify or Apple Music. I am genuinely sorry if this is out-of-the-blue or something like that for you. I just feel like at this rate if I keep this up, it will just get me nowhere, y’know? Now, about the name change, I am stuck amongst the names “X-rank”, or “TraX”, or maybe just making it “Svmm3r”. Any suggestions below would be wonderful. Thanks everyone for your support, your criticism, your fixing, and your admittance to not only me but the Auxy Community.

Stay tuned this summer!

            <p>Good advice here. I honestly think <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Xicon">@Xicon</a> is a good name. Easy to remember and slick. If you do wanna change though make sure you’re prepared to start from scratch.</p>

<p>I’m curious as to how many people are in this. Do you have a whole management team? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Also, I definitely prefer Ekstrak but it’s up to you.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Xicon">@Xicon</a> Choosing and sticking to an alias can be one of the hardest things to do when it comes to how you want to be identified as an artist. I know how much random $#!t I got for ‘changing my name’, but Arimyth is right; I did it because IVO didn’t mean anything to me, and it was getting buried under all those with the same name or variations of it. (Granted, being ‘IVO’ was pretty cool and sometimes I miss it. The clout has drifted lol) But seriously, if you don’t connect with “Ekstrak” the way you used to, there’s no harm in making a change.  When you’re still growing and learning as a producer, you still have the room and opportunity to play with different personas (that includes sounds / styles too). But don’t sell yourself short! You don’t deserve a gamertag as a name <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Yeah I like your current name honestly<br>
My advice with names is a. choose an original name and b. try not to have your name sound like an epic fortnite gamer tag</p>
<p>Your current name is original, and the new names you suggested sound like gamer tags so I don’t see why you should change it. Arimyth brought up some good points as well but I don’t think I need to restate them here</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>All for you making a new EP this summer, but I’d recommend sticking with your current name for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebranding with your alias can often result in confusion on behalf of your fanbase</li>
<li>Personally, I find your name to be very memorable and unique (almost to the point where I hear “Drum and Bass” thrown around in the Auxy Community and think of your alias)</li>
<li>You’re currently on the first page of google search results without having an overly obscure name which I guarantee will not happen with a name like “TraX” or “Svmm3r”</li>
<li>Any collaborations or label releases you’ve done will no longer be tied to your current name without chasing down your production partner and having him make the change for you</li>
</ul>
<p>It often helps to have a purpose when changing up your music production alias, as there is always a cost to doing it and therefore there should be a benefit equal or greater to said cost. hipdrop7, while known within this community, was probably not the most memorable name outside of it, and so he became <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a>. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xavior">@xavior</a> felt that there were too many IVOs out there to make his mark, and so he chose a name that he felt was personally meaningful and calls himself “Xavior” now.</p>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
