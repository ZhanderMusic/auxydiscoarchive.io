    <title>Record notes with a playing surface in Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/record-notes-with-a-playing-surface-in-auxy/368</link>
    <description>Some way of inputing notes in real-time instead of having to manually draw them in.  Even if it&#39;s a new kind of X-Y pad or something similar to the Korg EMX pitch ribbon/slider.  Would be a lot more natural way to create melodies and the like for me.</description>

            <p>I was thinking of something like a “naturalizer”, like swing except it offsets the notes a little to make things sound more natural.</p>

            <p>I don’t know what the XY approach is but you can number the chords in the key 1-7 and place them in succession I guess.</p>

            <p>We have some ideas for this that we’re hoping to be able to explore soon. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>ABSOLUTELY.  I’ve tried to imagine an Auxy playing surface before and come up short in my imagination.  Nothing really nailed the smooth aesthetic of everything else.  But I’m sure the team could come up with something cool.  Personally I agree with the XY esque approach.  Figure and ikaossilator being the prime examples of that.  The big question is how do you handle chords? Unless it was somehow made clear that it’s just for melodies. I dunno. But yeah, would be AMAZING.</p>
