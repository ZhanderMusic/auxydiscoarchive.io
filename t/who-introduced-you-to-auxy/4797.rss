            <p>I was at my friends house and we were bored. I looked up music making apps and found Medly. I thought medly was the best app ever and made a bunch of terrible songs with it. My friend and I made a weekend out of messing around with Medly.<br>
A week later, I learned about Auxy because I was really bored with Medly. Once again, all I did was look for music making apps and voila.</p>

<p>In which case, you are correct. Originally, Auxy’s app icon was AOXY, but then changed because someone thought they were playstation icons</p>
