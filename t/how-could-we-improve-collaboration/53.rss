    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-could-we-improve-collaboration/53</link>
    <description>I hope the &quot;share project as link&quot; feature has made collaboration easier. Do you have any ideas for how we could improve collaboration further? What&#39;s creating the most friction when collaborating on a track today?</description>

            <p>I’ve only collabed a little, but I kinda put short notes in the scene titles (e.g. Chorus Need Better Drums), though there’s usually not enough room in there, and you can’t see the whole title. I wouldn’t mind some in-app note taking.</p>
<p>A cool feature would be: near the play/export area where there could be a little notpad icon. When activated, the notes could appear next to the scene you’re on. Something like:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250.jpeg" title="67CC0BB3-2AC4-40F9-872E-D96C8FE6F6AA.jpeg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250_2_281x500.jpeg" alt="image" width="281" height="500" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250_2_281x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250_2_421x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250_2_562x1000.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/d/df199bd0e21e2fd585a9a538fc22f5d4bda9c250_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>And when you play the track, the notes could move onto the next one.</p>

            <p>Live collaboration (a track several people can edit at once) could be cool (kinda like google docs.) If not that at least shared tracks. Only one person can edit at a time but like anyone who shares the project gets any edits made. Could make it easier for people to collab without constantly sending each other links.</p>

            <p>I know that people have already requested this, but this is an old thread and just want to restate.</p>
<p>Live projet editing through multiple people would be nice. A built-in voice chat would be great also, but If that’s not possible, talking to the collaborator through discord or facetime, (As Auxy is an iPhone Exclusive) is a viable option.</p>

            <p>I feel like keeping track of projects is a big trouble, and also the dates. If we could have details such as project length in the browser (and next to the title inside the project) and date, that would be helpful. An addition of groups of instruments and files would be especially helpful as well so we can organize. I frequently find that actually deciding which is the newer version of the linked project and its multiples is an uneeded waste of time.</p>

            <p>Well when I collaborated with Decruz I created the platform of the song, the layout of what song is going to be. He then added to what I made. When we finnished sharing the project back and forth we made a pretty bad ass song. I say have an outlet of numerous platforms of songs where someone can just demo the song. If they feel they can really do a great job of finishing it they can contact the creator and they can start collaborating if they both agree it would work out together. I think this would be also a very great way for people to find more inspiration. A lot of my songs are inspired by what I create from the BTC because they force me to create something. Limitations can create so pretty amazing things. So if we all have a great network of public transactions people can still see what others are creating and find a hint of inspiration of each project they find. You can add a terms of agreement contract if by all means making people more comfortable to share their projects public to assure their trust from copyright.</p>

            <p>You could make an additional part of the feed that has projects people have posted for download/collaboration and they could include a brief description of what they need, etc but I think the main issue is how does one keep track of all the different versions of projects and who did what and so on? I don’t really know the answer but I believe that’s the big question</p>

<p>The idea is: you can make a project for more persons, so you can work in the project with two persons at the same time. Maybe you can add a chat so you can discuss the project.</p>
<p>I hope this is useful. If it’s not, I tried at least…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I did a design project last year on music collaboration. A lot of people I talked to really liked the idea of being able to post tracks and use tags to specify what they wanted help with (i.e. <span class="hashtag">#lead</span> or <span class="hashtag">#chorustransition</span>). There already is a way to share tracks to download into your Auxy in the feed. You could use this same function to let users post their compositions and ask for help and then have other people download the track and create their version, tagging the original artist in their version when uploading. I think this would be really fun because it’s more than just collaboration between 2 users who are already connected but collaboration in the community as a whole.</p>
