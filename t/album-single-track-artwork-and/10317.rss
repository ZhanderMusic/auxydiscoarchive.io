    <title>Album/Single Track Artwork and </title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/album-single-track-artwork-and/10317</link>
    <description>Hey there guys! I am fairly new to the Auxy community and I am already overwhelmed by the amount of active users that are constantly collaborating with others. I posted my first track today and ended up getting caught up in the fun of making album art. Drawing/Design was my first passion and I love making logos/album art/ etc. I can make a logo design for you based on the criteria you would like as well as in a variety of different ways. 

I can be reached via email at mbarry2233@gmail.com if you would be interested in seeing some of my work and collaborating on some art/music i am always around!  

You can also check out my soundcloud (My first official track was finished and posted today). All of my track artwork was created by me so if you want a quick sample give me a follow and check it out! 

Keep thumping y&#39;all
