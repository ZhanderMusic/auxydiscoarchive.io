**&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #25:   @Mr_Mooo  &lt;/big&gt;** 
 
&lt;big&gt;M&lt;/big&gt;OOOOOOOOO!

Hay there, 

Sam is a 13-year old artist from down-under in New Zealand. His twin is the same age. He previously called himself TriY, Captain Cow and MooMusic, before settling on Mr_Mooo (with exactly three O&#39;s). The image below is a totally real cow, posing casually in New Zealand.

In 2017, Mr_Mooo won a Unicorn for being voted the Auxy Forum’s 4th Most Supportive Forum Member of the year. No bull!  He recently celebrated 5000 plays and is beefing up his tracks so they might be re-posted by Auxy and widely herd. The steaks are high, but he would be over the moon. And would milk it for ages. 

 Check out his moosic here:  :soundcloud:  https://soundcloud.com/user-460338301/tracks

            <p>Mooo,</p>
<p>My fav parts from your most recent tracks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mayo - Catchy hook and nice use of vocal samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Golden waves - That rooster intro! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rooster.png?v=5" title=":rooster:" class="emoji" alt=":rooster:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gemini - Showcasing that Auxy automation! Nice quiet interludes between the busier parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glitch - Nice snare in the intro. Was wondering if it would actually be glitch (given the title).  And then: Extra glitch! Also liked the piano.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sing For You - Nice change of pace from the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sonder Dreams -   The title.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Noun. <strong>sonder</strong> (uncountable) (neologism) The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one’s own, which they are constantly living despite one’s personal lack of awareness of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what? All of the above tracks in the last month! Plus collabs and a couple of other tracks. You’re prolific!</p>

            <p>Hey, Mr. Mooo. Here’s my feedback. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>You have a lot of talent compositionally. But I feel like you overlayer (with really heavy synths) which kinda makes it unpleasant to listen to. This is especially a problem when there’s no automation leading into it. Try to make use volume more. And also, when it comes to packing your song full of synths and layers, remember, less is more (though I do admit to using tons of layers sometimes as well <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:">.)</p>

            <p>Thanks for all your feedback! Like I said earlier, bass IS my weak point. I really need to work on that ahah. It’s totally fine about you beating me, you deserved it! Your track was awesome, no need to apologise. As for the collab, I would be more than happy to, anytime.</p>

            <p>Alrighty, here we go!</p>
<p>First off, I think it’s amazing how much of an improvement you can hear over a very short period of time in your tracks! Your song structure and composition has greatly improved from your earliest tracks! I think it’s awesome how involved you are with other artists on the forum! You’ve got lots of collabs, and I think that’s great! One of my favorites has to be Oasis with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/st3r30">@ST3R30</a>. You two did a fantastic job with the melodies and chords in that one. Tides is overall one of my favorites - very well put together. I also think your track Sonder Dreams is really awesome. I feel like the bass could be a little more emphasized, or maybe the addition of a low sub-bass could help. To be completely honest, I feel that a handful of your projects would benefit from stronger bass - but it’s not a problem! Overall they all sound very nice, and I’m looking forward to hearing some new tracks! Also I’m really sorry about beating you in Auxy Tournament a week ago - your track was great ;-;</p>
<p>Congrats again on FMotW! Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>If you’re up for it, would you like to do a collab sometime? I feel like our styles could mix pretty well!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback! I will take it into account. Bass has always been my weak point… in my early songs sometimes I left bass out of the entire song because I forgot… oh jeez haha those were big mistakes</p>

I’ve been listening to quite a few of your songs, and they’re dope man. I especially like those big bass heavy tracks, and which you sometimes mix with future bass. The experimental stuff is dope. I think my favorite tracks of yours are Mayo, Gemini and Glitch. These tracks are chaotic in a good way <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/v.png?v=6" title=":v:" class="emoji" alt=":v:"> but be careful not to overdo it lol.<br>
In terms of feedback, there were a few things I noticed when listening to your tracks. First off, some of your tracks could use a little more sub bass in my opinion. For example, the drop in Gemini lacks power which could be solved with some sub bass (I think lol). I also feel the riser in the drop is a little too loud, so pay attention to volume automation.<br>
I love how much feedback you always provide for others, your contribution to this forum is great. Also, keep making music, and keep improving, you have some potential. Keep it up man! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

You’re no <em>cow</em>ard, you give so much great feedback, it’s <em>udder</em>ly ridiculous; you’re a <em>steak</em> holding up the whole Forum Member of the Week system, so it’s about time you got that recognition. You’re so cool and nice that nobody has <em>beef</em> with you…. yeah I’m done</p>
