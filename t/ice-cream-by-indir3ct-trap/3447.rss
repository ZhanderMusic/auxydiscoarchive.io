    <title>Ice Cream by INDIR3CT [Trap]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/ice-cream-by-indir3ct-trap/3447</link>
    <description>Hey! It’s INDIR3CT! So...not too fond of the new way of posting tracks but...

Here is a new track I have been working on for a long long time. It was inspired by @aUstin_Haga’s song Fuse, and @IAATOE’s song Alien.   I’ve been working really hard on many chords and automations to help make this song sound professional, unquie...and most importantly, fun!

https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/ice-cream

Please take a listen, any comments, and  feedback would be awesome. 

I really worked hard on this and would love your honest opinion; I was debating wether or not I should start putting my music on ITunes and Spotify. Please if you listen to the song, use this poll to help me decide :smiley: it would help a bunch!!

Should I start putting tracks (starting with this one) on ITunes, Spotify, Etc.?
