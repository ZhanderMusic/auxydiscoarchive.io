    <title>Amuse [releases] take up a bit of storage?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/amuse-releases-take-up-a-bit-of-storage/11415</link>
    <description>So I’m testing out amuse and I make and then delete some projects just to see how it works, I don’t submit anything. They’re entirely blank projects. But somehow those apparently don’t get deleted, even though I tapped delete, and take up a few mb of space?

I’m confused. I’m very confused.</description>

            <p>Contact Amuse support? Seems like the best choice. Have not yet experienced anything like this myself on anything I’ve put through there</p>

            <p>Okay, they’re not <em>projects,</em> they’re releases. But when I delete a release, it seems to not go away because the number of megabytes just increases and I can’t fix it.</p>
<p>I dunno, maybe it will solve itself?</p>

            <p>Either you meant to type <em>Auxy</em> instead of amuse, or you are more confused than I can comprehend.</p>
<p>Amuse is a distribution service. There <em>are</em> no projects.</p>
<p>If, however, you’re talking about <em>Auxy</em>, then when you delete a project, there will always be a backup version in the “backups” section. Those take up some space.</p>
