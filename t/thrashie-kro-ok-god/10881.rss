    <title>Thrashie/Kro - Ok God!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/thrashie-kro-ok-god/10881</link>
    <description>This is probably gonna be the darkest I’ll go when it comes to music. I scared myself with the arrangement of samples in this. Seriously I had second thoughts about uploading it, and of course I uploaded it at 3:33am on the dot without even realizing it.  Where’s my Bible?!?!

            <p>Damn now THAT’S friggin how you do a logo!! That is awesome.</p>
<p>I could totally see this being music to something like Se7en, Saw, something along the lines of Silence Of The Lambs. Terrifying in a great way. This a new name to replace Thrashie?</p>
<p>Thought it was maybe a new project name but then saw I was following already lol…</p>
