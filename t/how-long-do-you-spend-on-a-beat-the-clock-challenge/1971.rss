    <title>How long do you spend on a Beat The Clock challenge?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-long-do-you-spend-on-a-beat-the-clock-challenge/1971</link>
    <description>Wondering about process and duration of sessions of you guys. For me judging by the last two challenges it took about 3-4 hours per track. Maybe split Into 2-3 sessions and some small adjustments here and there afterwards. 

But I believe the more often that happens (pressure-wise), the better and more efficient sessions get. 

How about you? Let&#39;s find out (in average hours per challenge)

            <p>I wouldn’t really say that they randomly choose someone. I think that they just choose someone that they really like and admire as an Auxy user. Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>That sounds like a healthy way to get that education in <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> but I have the same feeling at work sometime, spending every free minute in the phone on a song I can’t stop thinking about <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I think 4 hours somehow is the magic number here… heard that from lots of Youtuber’s / producers as well…</p>

            <p>Technically on some of them I spend multiple hours/days on it as I constantly think about it during classes when I can’t sit down and write out the music. When I’m interrupted though it usually wouldn’t take more than 4 hours.</p>
