    <title>:100: Auxy Ideas (For if you are bored)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-ideas-for-if-you-are-bored/11225</link>
    <description>I was looking for fun things to do in Auxy. So I decided to spend 2 hours of my life creating this: 
![Auxy%20Prompts%20(2)|353x500](upload://hw76F431qlsbeQS1ucfisKP0OYk.jpg)
I created this to inspire myself, and the community of Auxians, to create. It&#39;s _extremely_ hard to read this on the disco, it was made to be printed out, but because I&#39;m looking to waste more of my time here is the list written out:
1. Create a song with chords that only use sharp notes.
2. Create a song on 300BPM.
3. Create a song on 60BPM.

95. Create a fast paced DnB beat.
96. Create a simple but impactful beat for a drop that you could dance to.
97. Create a song to make someone smile.
98. Create a catchy chorus.
99. Create an intense buildup.
100. Create a song. Just go wild and do it.

So how it works it that if you are bored, write the numbers 1 - 100 on paper, cut them out and pick one randomly (or in the more modern age, use an online random number picker) and then create whatever the list tells you to create.

I know some are very similar but it was hard coming up with 100 ideas.

I&#39;m very sorry for making the image version have a title that sounds like it came from a cheesy kids&#39; TV show.

**Feel free to post links to any tracks you have created using this list as inspiration.**

Ask me any questions you have about it.

Enjoy! :grin:</description>
