[Sequence and Series](https://soundcloud.com/icsleepers/sets/sequence-and-series)

Wrapping this up, a few months in the making. More an EP I guess not really a proper album. You&#39;ve all heard these songs already, but I figured I&#39;d try to give it a proper artwork treatment. 

If anyone wants to remix I&#39;m more than happy to provide the samples and axp files. I&#39;ve also set all the songs to downloadable just because. Mostly because I wanted to be able to listen to them offline, but if anyone else wants to grab them too, it&#39;s cool :slight_smile:

You&#39;ve probably already heard INITaux as well, I gave that album a proper cover (sort of proper) but nothing&#39;s changed there. That&#39;s all pre update Auxy 4 stuff (again, more than happy to share those project files for remixing and other abuse).

WHAT NEXT? I don&#39;t know. This stuff has been fun but there&#39;s other sonic areas I want to explore. I&#39;m open to collabs if anyone can deal with how slow I can be. I figure I want to take a bit of time to collect my thoughts on the ICS stuff before starting anything there, but of course, I still want to work with music :) so if anyone feels like some broken beat, drum and bass, glitchy, clicky IDM type stuff, I am game.

Thanks for following along if you&#39;re still here.

<p>Re-introducing “Sequence and Series” - also now on Spotify!</p>

<h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6c1ulz4quA0A6Pc912dDtg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sequence and Series</a></h3>

<p>Sequence and Series, an album by industry city sleepers on Spotify</p>

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>I wasn’t entirely happy with the mix, and with the help and guidance of <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> I settled on a nice pair of monitoring phones and spent a weekend tweaking and actively listening to all the tracks. Made my adjustments, piped everything through Grand Finale and replaced all the audio files.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to have this stuff on the iTunes store and Spotify, was always a personal goal of mine and it makes me happy to see it come to fruition <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Artwork has been done again as well. I’m not super thrilled with it, admittedly, next time around with the knowledge I’ve gained around here I’m going to give a real proper treatment. I was anxious to get these re-mixed versions back up and into Amuse.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy! Stay tuned for what comes next, still working out where I want to head but kicking some ideas around and have a new iPad on the way so I’m sure that’ll be a game changer (been using an iPhone SE this whole time, yikes! My thumbs hurt!)</p>

<p>Just wanted to share quick, I really do appreciate the feedback I get and the love these tracks have gotten over the last week has been really nice <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Again, if anyone wants to collab/remix/repurpose any of the tracks just let me know, I can throw everything up on drop box or maybe get my <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/poop.png?v=9" title=":poop:" class="emoji" alt=":poop:"> together and see about Google drive.</p>
<p>Again, many thanks <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/pray.png?v=9" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:"></p>

            <p>The least sample heavy track is Panopticon Flow, it’s only one sample. The rest are maybe 25-50%.</p>
<p>The MOST sample heavy is Dubplate Array (maybe about 70% samples)</p>
