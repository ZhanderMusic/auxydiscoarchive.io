    <title>What are some apps you used before Auxy?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-are-some-apps-you-used-before-auxy/8393</link>
    <description>Some apps I used before Auxy were: yello.electrofied which was an app where you could record sounds and turn it into music.
Beatwave which was really underrated. Similar to Auxy but different aswell. Had really cool dynamics and gave you lots of emotion when making a beat. 

Then.... I discovered auxy!</description>
