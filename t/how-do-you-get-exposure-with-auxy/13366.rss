    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-do-you-get-exposure-with-auxy/13366</link>
    <description>üòïSoooo,I have a pretty decent following on SoundCloud but no support from auxy or fellow Auxy users. I‚Äôve been using and investing in Auxy for the last 2 years increasing my skills of creation. I want the creators to see how far they have taken their users.  
house/techno/edm isn‚Äôt the only music that exists..üôÑ</description>

            <p>Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message people. Don‚Äôt DM spam people your links, that‚Äôs almost always a bad idea ‚Äì building actual relationships with people works a million times better, so people don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre just there to get their reposts. And I don‚Äôt say this primarily as a technique just to get plays; it can be useful for so many other things. Just know that people will be a lot more positively disposed toward you if your limited Internet relationship is more than just repost trading.</li>
<li>As for specific forum engagement ‚Äì posting your links unfortunately won‚Äôt do much. You may get support from a couple super dedicated members but overall you won‚Äôt grow too much. See point <span class="hashtag">#1</span>!</li>

            <p>Hi! Agreed with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xavior">@xavior</a> as above - engaging around here. There also the Auxy Collective on Discord with quite a few folks from around here, and some from not around here.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve got a following on SC already you probably don‚Äôt need to worry much, but there‚Äôs plenty of friendly folks here to provide feedback and to and receive from.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs quite a few people not writing house/techno/EDM I think you‚Äôll find <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
