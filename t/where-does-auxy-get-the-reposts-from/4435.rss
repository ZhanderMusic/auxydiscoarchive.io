    <title>Where does Auxy get the reposts from?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-does-auxy-get-the-reposts-from/4435</link>
    <description>Auxy has been reposting loads of songs recently, but where do they get the songs from? Since I haven&#39;t been on the disco for long, I was just wondering. Does Auxy get the songs from the disco which people make threads about or do they get it from the people they follow on Soundcloud? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quite obvious but I was just curious :smile:</description>

            <p>Tracks uploaded directly from Auxy automatically include the tag <span class="hashtag">#Auxy</span>. That makes auxy tracks easy to find and that’s how they discovered me.</p>
