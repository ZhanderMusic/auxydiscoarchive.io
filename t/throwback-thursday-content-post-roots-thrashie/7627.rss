    <title>[Throwback Thursday Content Post] Roots -Thrashie</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/throwback-thursday-content-post-roots-thrashie/7627</link>
    <description>So I thought I might experiment with post ideas while I finish the album so I’m gonna try this. The song itself is somewhat new and a bit old mainly because this was made as a nod to my old alias “RainbroThrash” and sound I had back then. (Gossip spammer lol) 
Anyway here you go. Hope you enjoy ^-^

            <p>Real cool! I don’t think there’s anything I’ve heard from you I didn’t like though.</p>
<p>All I can say is keep doing what you’re doing because it is sonically interesting, very textural. Which plays hard into my wheelhouse <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
