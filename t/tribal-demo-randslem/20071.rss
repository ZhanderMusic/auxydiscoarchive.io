            <p>No, I think that first section after the intro might work better without that vocal at all. (though keep the other vocals [grunts, etc…])</p>
<p>The main vocal feels like it could be one of the main hooks of the track. You’ve teased it in the intro, so hold it back for a little. Don’t spend it too early. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The 0:35–0:54 section is where you set up the main vibe, so no need to over-play the vocal yet.</p>
<p>You could start teasing it again at the 0:54… section, just lightly, like you’ve currently got for the 0:35–0:54 section, but only teasing it.</p>
<p>You’ll want to hold the main vocal back until you drop it big for the first big drop/chorus moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
It might be time to get the full length track sketched out. That’ll help you get a feel for when to go big, including the main vocal, and when to pull things back a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Do you have a clean version of the vocal? You might want to use that for the big drops.<br>
Alternatively, consider ways to layer that up on itself, to give it more beef for those bigger drops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Anyhoo, just some possibilities. Hope it’s helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
From the bits you’ve got so far, the vibe really offers some promise to the listener and feels like it could have real potential to a really great track.</p>

            <p>Love that intro!<br>
Really feels like it wants to break into a vocal track, even if it’s only using the same vocals from the intro but without the pitch-shifting. Especially as distorted/glitched/pitch-shifted vocals in the intro is a popular way to pre-use some of the main vocals in a track.</p>
<p>As the intro builds, it feels (to me) like the bass should also be building.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing the final piece. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
