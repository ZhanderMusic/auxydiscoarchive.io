This might as well be the way I announce that I&#39;m going under a [new alias on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe) since I&#39;ve ran out of Soundcloud minutes since around the middle of December. I&#39;m going to be focusing myself on music from now on, and keeping my head out of any trouble. Hope everyone is having a fantastic New Year and I will work on continuing to improve my music.

Enjoy, everyone.
