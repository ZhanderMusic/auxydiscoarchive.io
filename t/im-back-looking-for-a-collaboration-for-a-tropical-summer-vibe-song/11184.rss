    <description>Hello guys its good to be back! After all that 1 year exam rumble and being away from Auxy and auxy disco for nearly 7 months i am back at auxy and music production. I realised that somehow my music talent is worse now i cant do nothing for some reason? Is it really because i didnt create music for 7 months? Anyways i would be glad if you have any advices for me about that.

By the way if anyone is interested i want to make a collab song that has tropical and summer vibes! Since summer is here you know ðŸ˜›.If you want to collab with me just comment or send me a message.</description>
