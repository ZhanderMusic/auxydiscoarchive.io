    <description>What would go down would be that viewers would submit their tracks, maybe a guaranteed review for a small amt. of money and “someone that’s big in the community and talented” would listen to the tracks and offer critical feedback. People like deadmau5 and Ramzoid do this, could an Auxy specific one work?</description>

            <p>Gotta disagree. While you are right that they seem to have one genre / set of genres that they really like, they definitely still give good feedback, whether it’s mixing, song structure, sound choice, or whatever. I’ve played my WIPs numerous times &amp; gotten great feedback every time — and the types of music I’ve had played are almost the opposite of the genre that they seem to prefer.</p>

            <p>Feedback streams were the best. It gave me a chance to actually know what people had to say on my unfinished projects so I can further work on them. I think some of the advice I had gotten on there really helped me a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting things I’ve noticed about the collective streams is that there are often a mix of both auxians and musicians that use other DAWs, so you’ll get both feedback on specifically how to use the app better as well as feedback from other producers on how your music holds up to other daws and more generally to the music industry in general.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a lot of value in this. There are a lot of concepts that can be applied across platforms, and it’s always good to be aware of all your choices and how various techniques can and will apply to those platforms.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As stated by <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/el1011">@El1011</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/hydrans">@HYDRANS</a>, and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/polar">@Polar</a>, we host these on (some) Saturdays on the Auxy Collecive discord voice channels. One of our New Years resolutions for the collective was to host these more consistently, and I’m planning on delegating the hosting and organization of said streams to a few people so I can disconnect my availability with the availability of the streams.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things I’ve noticed about the collective streams is that there are often a mix of both auxians and musicians that use other DAWs, so you’ll get both feedback on specifically  how to use the app better as well as feedback from other producers on how your music holds up to other daws and more generally to the music industry in general. So that’s one thing to note that I find valuable Atleast.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are interested in joining the next stream we do you can find our listing in the discourse discord directory topic (not gonna plug it here. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:">)</p>
<p>And if this is not what you were referring to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/produk">@Produk</a> then definitely let me know–but from what I can tell about what you’re describing, there’s a pretty good solution that exists.</p>

            <p>Thats basically what the Auxy Collective feedback streams are. We take submissions (free of course) 15 minutes prior and give feedback to them.</p>
<p>We try to do it every Saturday, but it’s not a guarantee.</p>
<p>Another, more popular and reliable version of this is on phuture collective. They have way more people, way more experienced people, and a lot more feedback. They do it every Sunday. The problem with them though, is the queue is a LOT longer and you could wait hours until it’s your turn, unless you are apart of their Patreon ($10/month)</p>
<p>An official Auxy version of this wouldn’t be bad but we kinda already have it.</p>

            <p>I cohost the Auxy collective feedback streams and I think they are helpful</p>
<p>I could probably help with with something like this, I think it’s a good idea</p>

            <p>obs and sound-flower.<br>
if you have a Mac, you can plug in your phone and open up quick time and choose the phone as a recording device and change your audio input to the computer so whatever goes through the phone goes through the computer which goes through the stream.</p>
<p>(I actually have both of those set up already for my home computer lol.  I did some small game streams a while back)</p>

            <p>I’ve been actually thinking of livestreaming (once I figure out how <em>that</em> works) making a song, but that’s different. I really like this idea, we could let different people regardless of skill level come and host, like a radio show.</p>
<p>…Actually, this would literally be straight up a radio show with commentary criticism, and that’s not a bad thing! A little bit of feedback is nice to anyone. I’d be totally down to submit tracks, or maybe even host an episode if we go there!</p>

            <p>maybe.  But we already have that, albeit very rare, on the Auxy collective discord</p>

            <p>What would go down would be that viewers would submit their tracks, maybe a guaranteed review for a small amt. of money and “someone that’s big in the community and talented” would listen to the tracks and offer critical feedback. People like deadmau5 and Ramzoid do this, could an Auxy specific one work?</p>
