    <title>My brother got SoundCloud! (He makes music too)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-brother-got-soundcloud-he-makes-music-too/17824</link>
    <description>My brother got a SoundCloud account! He’s seen me making music for a while, so he subscribed to Auxy to try it himself. He’s actually really good (and I’m not just saying that because he’s my brother) and usually makes synthwave, house and tropical music. His SoundCloud is https://SoundCloud.com/dtracksounds.

Thanks for reading!
