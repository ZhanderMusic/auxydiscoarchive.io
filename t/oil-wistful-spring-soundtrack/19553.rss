    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/oil-wistful-spring-soundtrack/19553</link>
    <description>I pitched this and a couple other songs I made for a videogame. While none of them actually made it into that one, one of them did get accepted by another developer. We’ll see what comes of it.

Hope you enjoy.</description>

            <p>I figured. I’m just new to the whole thing of producing for money and for someone to ask what I charge for my music is really cool. It’ll become more normal to me as time passes, but it’s something big and something to start with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even got paid!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That statement really should be this one…</p>
<p><em>Got paid.</em></p>
<p>(It should be something that doesn’t trigger surprise or an exclamation. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Your friend will expect to make money/get paid if his business experiment comes off.<br>
Unless you’re joining in on the risk (e.g. working for equity % in the app), it’s perfectly reasonable that you get paid a flat fee upfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Fwiw, working for equity is sometimes a good gamble.</p>
<p>Fun story… Old acquaintance of mine did some graphic design for a friend’s startup mobile games company. He did it for low single-digit % in equity.</p>
<p>The company went well, really well, and launched a mobile game that became huge. Eventually the company IPOd — and he became a multi-millionaire overnight.</p>
<p>So, don’t necessarily rule out working for equity. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It was an indie project on Casting Call Club. The other developer’s a friend of mine who’s done a bunch of graphics work for esports and does other kinds of design commissions, on top of being a damn fine programmer. He liked my music so he approached me and asked to use some in a game he was planning on making. Even got paid! I’ve got a few friends who’re also studying game development, as well. Guess networking really do be doing its thing</p>
