            <p>I’m not too sure actually, a lot of my track’s, i dont feel, would really fit well in a game, But i think the best one that would somewhat even fit is an unreleased track of mine that i kinda revolved around some deadmau5 stuff.<br>

            <p>I don’t know if this could be in a video game but it could be in a 4 minute game trailer. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user_176587898/cyberspace" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/user_176587898/cyberspace</a></p>

            <p>I don’t think my songs are usable at all for video games, though a previous beat the clock entry of mine might be, or at least <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stereofield">@stereofield</a> commented that it sounded like video music haha.</p>
