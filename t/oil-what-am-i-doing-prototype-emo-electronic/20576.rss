    <title>OIL — What Am I Doing (Prototype) [Emo, Electronic]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/oil-what-am-i-doing-prototype-emo-electronic/20576</link>
    <description>I found a clip I really liked on YouTube so I downloaded it, chopped it up (with varying success cause it wasn’t completely consistent in time), and slapped it into Auxy. I kinda like it.

[Here it is!](https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/cWVVxZNs68T11xRa9)

The link to the original video is in the description of the track, so please show the guitarist some love if you check it out &lt;3</description>
