    <title>Final Breath [WIP] (in need for some criticism)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/final-breath-wip-in-need-for-some-criticism/15481</link>
    <description>Hey y’all

I know I already posted about an earlier version of this project, but I’m just about ready to post this and I want to know what changes could potentially make this song better.

Any feedback/tips would be much appreciated.

Thanks
