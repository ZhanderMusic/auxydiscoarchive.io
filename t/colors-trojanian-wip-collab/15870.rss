    <title>Colors - Trojanian [WIP, Collab?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/colors-trojanian-wip-collab/15870</link>
    <description>Hey, y&#39;all. It&#39;s me. Anyone wanna see what they can do with an old project of mine that didn&#39;t work out too well? I made it to fit a melody I was to write but couldn&#39;t. I kinda wrote a chorus, though. Kinda... It&#39;s under the sound called Fragment and starts at Scene 5, but I forgot to turn it on. You can mess around with that, too. Also tried to add a drop but was an **epic fail**. Enough talking for me, though. Let&#39;s see what happens with this.
