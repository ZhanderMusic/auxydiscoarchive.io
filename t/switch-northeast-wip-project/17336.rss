    <title>Switch - NorthEast [WIP, Project]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/switch-northeast-wip-project/17336</link>
    <description>That’s right, after a 2 year hiatus, I’ve returned with a new iPhone. Now, being me, I’ve already downloaded Auxy and made me a bit of a tune. However I’m not very intrigued with how it sounds just yet. Give me some tips on how to make it sound better? (Note: my being gone did make me a bit rusty, so don’t throw a whole bunch of advanced terms at me...)

Treat it with care, cuz I don’t know how active I’ll be whenever this drops. Gotta get on a plane going back to Hawaii. Thanks!</description>
