    <title>Old Stuff - Lex [Collection]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/old-stuff-lex-collection/8195</link>
    <description>So along with the EP I released onto my bandcamp today, I also put up a huge collection of songs I made way before Auxy got a makeover and I joined Auxy Disco.

They’re VERY unprofessional, but still sound okay I think!

Feel free to check them out here:

It’s a very mixed bag... some ambient, some experimental, some straight up crazy stuff. Let me know if you like any!</description>
