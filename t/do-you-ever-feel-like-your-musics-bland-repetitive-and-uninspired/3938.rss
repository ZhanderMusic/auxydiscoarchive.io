            <p>make a song using only AP-006. Instant satisfaction guaranteed. Or collab with someone who contrasts with your style! It might take forever (ahem sorry <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/otzsil">@Otzsil</a>) but it will kinda broaden up your alleyways, knowwhatimsayin?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As I desperately try to make my music “better” I often start finding it bland and repetitive. This is because I’m of a rather unpopular opinion in terms of style, music tastes and composition techniques as compared to most of the people on the forum. It’s especially discouraging knowing that others will get loved regardless of what they think of their own songs due to who they happen to be, or that a song I like won’t be loved no regardless of how good I think it is. But I keep moving forward keeping in mind that I write music to make myself happy.</p>
<p>(note that this isn’t to say that my music isn’t loved, it’s just an example. I’ve had tracks that I thought were the best I’ve done that got torn to shreds by others for being “dissonant” or “repetitive drums” and the sorts)</p>

            <p>In this case, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/produk">@Produk</a> maybe expirement in other genres. I mean we all can agree that you are one of the best future bass producers on this forum, so maybe try implementing future bass elements or your style into house, dnb, etc.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear stuff in the house section. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>This is pretty much my approach, except with one small modification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen to music</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
<li><strong>Still make crap music</strong></li>
</ol>
