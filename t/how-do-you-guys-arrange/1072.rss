            <p>For some odd reason I work backwards. If I have a set idea in my head (often the bass drop) I’ll make that first and then I’ll make the build up and so on and so forth.</p>

            <p>I find it’s easiest (for me) to start with drums. I make all the drum lines I think I’ll need for a song first, and then once you have that sort of metronome in your head, making the melodies and chorus/drops is a bit easier. After that I’ll sequence it. But that’s me.</p>

            <p>It’s just easier in later stages of the song when everything is in order.  Especially when I’m adding fills that need to go from one pattern to another.  Being able to just click the next pattern to finish off whatever drum notes I’m adding is a no brainer then.</p>

            <p>Good response. Seems like having the visuals be in order is pretty important for you.  Makes sense. Projects do tend to get messy</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I get a basic groove going first, just one pattern in one scene with a bunch of instruments and drums.  Once I get a really solid groove going that I like, I duplicate all the patterns into a new scene.  Then in the second set of patterns, I start making changes to what I already had.  Remove some (or a lot of ) notes, add some notes, use a new melody line, make everything stacatto, whatever.  Once I get something there I like, I duplicate all the patterns again.  Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Once I get about 8-10 scenes worths of all these different variations, I go back and play them back to back in different orders, trying to work out the song structure.  This is where things get messy for me in Auxy though I have to admit.  Once I get a song structure together out of all those pattern variations, I want to see if visually progress one pattern after the other in order as it plays.  And usually the patterns are all over the place in relation to each other once I have a song structure figured out.  So generally at this point I take a deep breath and carefully put all the patterns in the right order so the song plays back correctly, then adjust the scenes to trigger the patterns in their new, correct playback order.  Whew, wish there was some sort of “Reorder patterns based on Scenes” function <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now I’ll go back and add any transitional notes to individual patterns to help thigns flow more smoothly and not just sound like a bunch of loops played sequentially.  Drum fills to signify the coming of a new pattern, a crash perhaps to highlight a particularly large transition in the song, etc.  Something to make it flow a bit more linearly and not just Loop A, Loop B, etc.  Ditto for the transitions (and soon to be automation), I’ll add some of that to highlight builds or parts of the song where I’m scaling things back.</p>
