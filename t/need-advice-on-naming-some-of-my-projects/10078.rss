    <title>Need advice on naming some of my Projects!</title>

    <description>I would like to hear your opinions on what I should name these songs I&#39;m stuck on naming. 

First Track- https://soundcloud.com/its-chef27/devoted-whale/s-siTAa
My friend said it sounded like mega man. Maybe that&#39;ll help?

Second Track- https://soundcloud.com/its-chef27/bossy-snail/s-GLEaS
This one I got no clue. Reminds me of racing. Perhaps &quot;Blur&quot; would be good.

Last Track- https://soundcloud.com/its-chef27/moody-alpaca/s-2RcPQ
&quot;Moody Alpaca&quot; gives me an ocean vibe. I&#39;ll probably go with &quot;Coral&quot; or &quot;Jellyfish&quot;

Any other feedback is wanted. Thanks for your time!</description>

            <p>One thing that I do is shut the lights off in my room, close the blinds, sit on my bed and clear my mind. Once this is done, I play the song through my headphones and let it take me on a journey somewhere (kinda like a story) because like books, each song has there own story. Once you “come back” from your journey, think of what happened, maybe even write it down. You can now think about the overall journey and figure out a good name that summarizes up the journey. That’s how  I figure out names for my songs.</p>
