            <p><big> <strong>‚ì¶ho is the winner?</strong> </big></p>
<p>Our judge this week was <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dadmother">@Dadmother</a>, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt was honestly a tough choice, but I have to go with TC64 - <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tc64music/paradise-87" rel="nofollow noopener">Paradise ‚Äò87</a>. The musicality and structure of the track is incredible. It‚Äôs so much fun, super dynamic, and is a great example of how an artist can really take Auxy by the horns and push it to the limit. Plus the sample work was ON POINT.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TC64">@TC64</a> for winning Track of the Week.  He receives a  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:"> icon next to his forum name, right next to his unicorn. And his name is recorded as a <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961">Track of the Week Winner</a>.</p>
<p>The thread for next weeks competition will be posted soon.</p>

            <p>This track is mostly focused on melodic elements with a light beat accompaniment. It goes from a darker mood to a light one in the first chorus. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Also I used a snap sample.</p>
