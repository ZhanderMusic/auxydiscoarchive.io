&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #11: @NotMiles &lt;/big&gt;

He&#39;s from Chicago and a British citizen. He used to be called &#39;Kilometers&#39; and made music using with the Figure app &amp; by blowing hard into a trombone. Nowadays, he basically lives here in the Auxy Disco and makes Auxy music while the trombone gathers dust. 

The upside-down ginger cat is named &#39;Cooper&#39;, apparently. Although the dangling be-spectacled feline could equally be called &#39;NotMiles&#39;. Of course, technically speaking: -   **WE. ARE. ALL. NOTMILES**.  
Unless your name happens to be &#39;Miles&#39;, in which case you are probably...  &#39;NotNotMiles&#39;.

And guess who won the highly-coveted Auxy Star Wars Beat-The-Clock Challenge? Yep, NotMiles. 

**Week starting: 12 Mar, 2018.**

            <p>Alright, left a bunch of comments across your latest tracks. I love how original they are!</p>
<p>That drop you made with Coops was insane. June has always been one of my favorite tracks, so relaxing! Elixirs is quite nice, but I think it might need a little more high-end, but that could just be me. (Yeah it probably is lol). Cinq takes on of my favorite jazz songs to a whole new level.</p>
<p>I love how your tracks are often experimental but you ace the genre every time. Great job, NotMiles. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I think it depends on what you want to make, since you mastered basics.<br>
If you want to try out new genres, listen more of them and get some tips from them.<br>
If you want to polish your works more, studying music theories couly help you.<br>
If you don’t know what to make next, I would like to request you to remix any of your favorite song <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And we will always support you to improve your music!</p>

<p>Ayyy NotMiles!!! My old meme friend from corn field… always nice to chat with you here.<br>
Some of your songs grab my heart and I can’t stop listening to them.<br>
My favorites are June and Cinq.<br>
June, is kinda nostalgic and chill tune which reminds me lots of towns in video games. Repetitive, but I never get tired of it. I even hum the melodies <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
About Cinq, I fall in love with its jazzy fancy atmosphere, but after listening it multiple times , i really impressed by perfectly constructed  melodies. This one is now in my driving playlist.</p>
<p>Look forward to your future songs!</p>
<p>Cooper’s fan</p>

            <p>Man, what an artist you are <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/notmiles">@NotMiles</a>. I love viewing the project files of detailed, complicated works with lots of changes, and I’m almost itching to see how you work. But all good, all good. I’ll let it remain a mystery.</p>
<p>Gotta say, I defs love your moodier works, and by the looks of the above, so does everyone else. I’ll leave as much gushing as I can on your SC, but I wanna say a bit more here.</p>
<p><strong>Quadrant</strong> is like listening to a dope medley. Nothing really overstays its welcome, and you really get to show off the versatility of your style.</p>
<p><strong>Elevation: -3600km</strong>: First of all, km? An American using the <em>METRIC SYSTEM</em>!? Hehe, I listened to the track at the start of the week when I was tired and I was like, “Man, this is good content. I’m going to have to dedicate a night to this guy.” This is along the lines of something I wish I could make, but you just hit the nail on the head. 7 minutes flew by like it was nothing. I’ll see what the rest of your tracks are like, but I think you’re pretty conscious about maintaining interest throughout a song.</p>
<p><strong>Elixer</strong>: MEOW! There’s so much fun here even though it has moody atmospheric synths. I enjoyed the building tension in the middle of the song.</p>
<p><strong>NotMiles X <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dho">@DHO</a>  - Drifting Into The Depths</strong> Man, DHO, your piana here is just lovely. NotMiles just gives it all the room in the world to breathe and be beautiful, while maintaining the style underneath to gently re-enter. Just noice.</p>
<p><strong>Corvus</strong> was the spookiest track for me. Many appreciations for a good spook. All the playfulness was overwhelmed by the spooky dooky. Almost like an unhappy ending?</p>
<p><strong>June</strong>: so gentle, so pretty. Liked it a lot. Can’t be edgy all the time, right?</p>
<p>I’m falling asleep so might have to pick up the rest of your tracks tomorrow. Interested to see how your style changes in your earlier stuff.</p>
