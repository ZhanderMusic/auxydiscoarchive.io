    <title>For those who are trying to find their sound</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/for-those-who-are-trying-to-find-their-sound/1485</link>
    <description>It&#39;s very hard to get a sound that you can call your own, so I think it&#39;s incredible that I can listen to any random auxy song and be like &quot;Oh, that&#39;s Phil&quot;,  &quot;Oh, that&#39;s Austin&quot;, or &quot;Oh, that&#39;s etc.&quot; even though they tread mostly within the same genres. It&#39;s because I&#39;m pretty sure they go in with the mindset that they don&#39;t want to make music that is good, they want to make music that is **them** . If you have passion for your music, it&#39;s inevitable that others will too. So don&#39;t focus on impressing the masses, focus on impressing yourself. If you can&#39;t make a club banger to save your life, but you make long, beautiful, and melodic songs, more power to ya. Take your time and create something that you can be proud of, whether that takes a day or a month. And if you truly love music, your passion will shine through in every song.

            <p>I’d like to be surprised if a well known Auxy artist uses a different genre.<br>
Like imagine DeCruz making a drum and bass song instead of what he does now once in a while.</p>
