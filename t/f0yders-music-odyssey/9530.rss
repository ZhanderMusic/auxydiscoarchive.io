            <p>Like the intro. I suggest not having a kick when the snare hits. Nice pads. I see you are using the new pack.</p>
<p>At some points I think there was too much going on and frequencies were bit too high. But the pads were quite good.</p>
<p>Buildup was good, maybe change in bass line?<br>
And before the drop have a little 11/kick, 12/snare 14/hi hat.</p>
<p>I think would of been a good transition.</p>
<p>Drop was pretty cool and different.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work buddy. Just maybe try not too have too much high pithed stuff in one spot. And just donâ€™t go too high in general.</p>
