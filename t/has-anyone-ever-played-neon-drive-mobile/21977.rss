There was a mobile game called “Neon Drive”  and it was one the best experiences i have ever had, it is a driving arcade on 80’s style. Everything was bright and the visuals are very VERY smooth and it was getting updates regularly with new levels and music added to it.
Sadly it got removed from Appstore for some reason and to this day I have no idea why or what happened to the game and I missed it alot.

Weeks ago I remixed one of their soundtracks and I would like you to have a look at it. Also you may take a listen to the soundtracks of the [game](https://youtu.be/QJef05f8tOI) because they are very unique and amazing.

Here is one of them that I made, a remix of [Level 1 Soundtrack ](https://app.auxy.co/projects/1aLm7ABuIq6BnqENs7qiAg==)</description>
