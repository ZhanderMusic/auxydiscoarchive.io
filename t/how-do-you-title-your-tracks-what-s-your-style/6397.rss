    <title>How do you title your tracks? (What’s your style)?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-do-you-title-your-tracks-what-s-your-style/6397</link>
    <description>I find it interesting how different artists use different motifs to title their tracks. Me personally I like to name my tracks about how I’m feeling, or things that have happened to me.
 for example:
Cureless pain, young love hurts, fully torn.
 or generally things to do with space or where a track sounds like it’s going. 
For example:
New Dimension, beyond, gone wild

What do you use to create a title?</description>

            <p>The process i like to go through to name a song is imagine a music video that would go with the song. I imagine the story that would go with the song and try to base it off the main ‘feel’ of the track. Then i try to make my song title based on the video idea i came up with. However, sometimes the title is taken straight from what the song sounds like. My song ‘Cascade’ was named after the main melody. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/r-jrdn/cascade" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/r-jrdn/cascade</a></p>

            <p>I like naming my tracks off of the most random things. Like, the most random things ever. For instance one was named “valley_jpg” (the track had nothing to do with a valley!), another was “vision seq.” (Once again, no resemblance!). Maybe im just really creative. Maybe I’m super weird. I don’t know.</p>

            <p>I try to create an atmosphere with music, so my titles give a name to give a name to the “place/event/feeling” I just created (Usually added after finishing a song or midway through making it).<br>
Or I just pick a cool word and write a song about it.</p>
<p>I’ve only titled a song about my own emotions once (I Feel Like I Can Fly)</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve used that approach before too.<br>
Generally stumble on something that works rhythmically with a significant detail of the track.</p>
<p>That said, a few of my tracks are intended to end up as vocal tracks, so I’m partly just thinking ahead, based on thematic moods, etc…</p>

            <p>Either</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take a nap listening to the song. Then what is literally the first thing that pops into your head when you are partially awake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>words that would fit the rhythm of the melody. Or what lyrics could be to the hook if I had vocals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the first letters from the auto generated title and use that as a starting off point for word association to fit the mood of the song. For a made up example: Moody cow —&gt; more clouds -&gt; Mostly overcast, or maybe rain, or must be grey.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>Usually I’ll have some sort of feeling from it as I’m making it, then when I’m listening to the last few mixes, I’ll start to see some sort of imagery in my head. If I had the time to animate, I would probably make a lot of fantasy music videos for them.</p>
<p>So I title my songs based on the strongest scene in my head.</p>

            <p>I name it ‘Sketch’ and then add a number that’s 1 higher than the last track that I called ‘Sketch’.</p>
