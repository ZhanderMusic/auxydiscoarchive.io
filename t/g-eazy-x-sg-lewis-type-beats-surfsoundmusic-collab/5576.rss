    <title>G Eazy X SG Lewis Type Beats - SurfSoundMusic [Collab?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/g-eazy-x-sg-lewis-type-beats-surfsoundmusic-collab/5576</link>
    <description>Examples of the type of instrumentals I’m trying to arrange new tracks off of are “Some Kind of Drug- G Eazy” and any SG Lewis song- specifically “No Less”

The point of this post:
1. If you are not interested in making full tracks with me- if any one would like to help me try to replicate synth sounds like the intro to “no less” and the beginning of “some kind of drug”, and try to replicate the tunings on the drum kits used, that would help me a lot! :) 

2. If anyone is interested on working on these types of beats by sending our edited projects to each other via Auxy links do let me know. Once completed, I will post them on my social media music accounts (with given credit, and permission from you of course) to try to get our music out there, and potentially sold. I have connections with producers (their accomplishments include producing/ using their vocals for Meek Mill, Rick Ross, Logic and DJ Khaled, and more), whom offered to critique whatever projects I send to them, and maybe pass them on to other artists if we are on to something! 
Let me know down below if there is any questions- and let’s make some music 💪🏻🔥</description>
