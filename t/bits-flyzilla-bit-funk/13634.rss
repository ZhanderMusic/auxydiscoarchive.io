            <p>Nice track! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>I like the intro, but maybe make it half the length so the repetition doesn‚Äôt get boring.</p>
<p>Same goes for the part with the first drums. Sounds great, good production (reminds me a little of <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fokkses">@Fokkses</a>) but it should be shorter.</p>
<p>Assuming you use 8 bars for the intro without drums, and 8 for the drums without percussion, maybe cut those both down to 4 and then add a melody or something with Bitty or Stress when the percussion comes in.</p>
<p>Listening to the rest of the track, I would just say that overall, your production is great and there aren‚Äôt very many ways you could improve it. The main thing that needs to be improved is the composition &amp; arrangement, since there‚Äôs basically one thing going the whole track. You have a pretty cool thing going and the repetition makes it a little boring. Remember, repetition isn‚Äôt bad by definition, but it can be if the track becomes boring because of it!</p>
