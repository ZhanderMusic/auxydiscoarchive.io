    <title>Bases that actually can be used as melodies</title>

    <description>Yes, there are a few, believe it or not. Some basses, on high notes, can sound like normal leads. Now I&#39;m not gonna talk about the disgusting ones, like Freak(nasty)(bad bass ever), but I&#39;ll focus on the more applicable ones.
Let&#39;s start with Bee.
You hear Bee in a lot of DeCruz&#39;s earlier songs, and it can be used to create a bright and uplifting feel when paired with a lead sound like Mist. The bee should use high notes. Don&#39;t use Bee in darker songs, as it doesn&#39;t fit as well.

Basically none of the ones from Vivrant work well, but 7 Skies is where it gets interesting.

Cube makes for a great pluck lead, you can hear it in the drop of Akyut&#39;s BTC#14. Pepper also has an interesting pluck sound. Basically if you want a weird, thick(with 2 c&#39;s amirite) sounding pluck lead, go for 7 Skies. Just try it. P.S. Must be using high notes. Low and mid range notes won&#39;t work as well at all.
RAC is very similar to 7 Skies. Cool leads.

Now for the Future. Basically all of these are great, but some shine above the rest. I used Lobster as a lead in my song Bluetown. Lizard is a great one also, as it can create this happy moving feel. You can hear it in HAYW1R3&#39;s song H M M. Lots of the other songs create really cheerful sounds, so don&#39;t use them for dark and moving songs. I hate to say it, but they create a very &quot;Owl City-ish sound&quot;.

That&#39;s basically it, did I miss any?</description>

            <p>most of the original basses work.<br>
the only real exception i could find was Punch (b/c it’s more of a sub bass type)</p>
