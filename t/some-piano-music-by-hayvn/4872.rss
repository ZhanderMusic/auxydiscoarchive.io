    <title>Some piano music - By HAYVN</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/some-piano-music-by-hayvn/4872</link>
    <description>I woke up extremely exhausted today and apparently decided to write a 5 min and a half piano piece. I hope my emotions while writing this will convey.
This song is the most precious to me.

It&#39;s going to be my last song for some time.</description>

            <p>I don’t want you to give up. As I used to say to all of my friends, I’m the only person who’s supposed to give up.</p>
<p>Taking that into account, don’t give up. Please. Your music is beautiful. And loved. Nobody’s got a style like you… but at the same time, just relax. Don’t push yourself. If you need another hiatus, take it. Just come back next time, raring to go.</p>

            <p>This is clearly your language.  I encourage you to keep speaking it, even if you never share any of it.  Words are insufficient.</p>
