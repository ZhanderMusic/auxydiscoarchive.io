            <p>Perhaps a quick video showing some bass lines would be appropriate?</p>

            <p>As someone whose tracks usually go as bassy as I can make them with Auxy, I can offer a couple personal tips about what I do to create a successful bassline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I refrain from making full melodies with basslines that might unintentionally stick out above other pieces that are more important to the track (i.e. the actually melody). Most of my basslines are rather consistent and highly repetitive and stupid simple.</li>
<li>This kind of transitions into my second piece of advice. I suggest you don’t make it complicated at all. As I said, a bassline (unless intended) shouldn’t stand out. You want something the listener can bop their head to as they’re tapping their foot to the drumline and humming the tune. (At least that’s what I envision and listen for when I’m reviewing my own work.) I typically don’t put more than six ‘notes’ down per measure, because then it might get overwhelming and won’t blend with the rest of the music well. And you can tell when the bass “bleeds” (as I call it) into the melody and causes an incoherent mess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps my advice is to vague, but I hope I could help in some way. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
