            <p>Probably, but what use is it understanding something if it isn’t particularly accurate?</p>
<p>Better, imo, to start from correct, then find a way to expressly simply - without sacrificing accuracy, or at least without leaving important gaps.</p>
<p>But, maybe that’s just me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Some things are just complex.</p>
<p>Explaining alt time signatures is already a complex issue to start with. Trying to explain how to fake them in Auxy only compounds the problem.</p>

            <p>The word I’d use is more ‘accurate’.</p>
<p>What you said didn’t touch upon the ‘losing sync’ aspect and seemed to conflate the number of beats in a bar with the number of bars in a sequence.</p>

<p>‘Impressing’ Lenberg is already hit and miss. There are a great many things that people are putting time and effort into that aren’t moving Lenberg’s opinion on things.</p>

<p>I didn’t have the option for a 7/8 time signature, I did it anyway. Three times actually. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/gaia-demo" rel="nofollow noopener">One time in a demo</a>, then two times in my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/sets/re-mastered-ep" rel="nofollow noopener">Re/Mastered EP,</a>, in the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/re-visiting" rel="nofollow noopener">intro song</a> and the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/re-gaia" rel="nofollow noopener">ending song</a>, which just so happened to also include a makeshift 3/4 time portion.</p>

<p>To clarify, to emulate a 5/4 signature in Auxy, you will need to use 8-bar patterns, using only the first 5 bars, and then set section length to 5 in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this ‘faking it’ approach means your 5-bar (8) pattern will go ‘out of sync’ with the bars UI in the app, as you’ll effectively be delaying the start of the next bar by one beat every time. This causes a knock-on effect that takes 5 bars in Auxy to resolve cleanly.</p>
<p>So, it’s doable, but it’s messy (in Auxy).</p>

<p>It’s doable and messy. But I’d say if you really want to, and have the patience for it, and can make it work, then do it. I don’t think I was able to accomplish it very well but I still did it and I was happy with it. Hey, maybe if someone made it work it would make Lenpai consider alternate key signatures. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/is-there-a-way-to-make-5-4-time-signature/7582/13">spoiler</a></span></p>

            <p>That, on its own, is not what a 5/4 time sig means.<br>
A 5/4 time sig would be like a simple 4/4, but with <span class="bbcode-u">an extra beat per bar</span>.</p>
<p>What you’re suggesting is an extra bar per pattern.</p>
<p>To clarify, to emulate a 5/4 signature in Auxy, you will need to use 8-bar patterns, using only the first 5 bars, and then set section length to 5 in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this ‘faking it’ approach means your 5-bar (8) pattern will go ‘out of sync’ with the bars UI in the app, as you’ll effectively be delaying the start of the next bar by one beat every time. This causes a knock-on effect that takes 5 bars in Auxy to resolve cleanly.</p>
<p>So, it’s doable, but it’s messy (in Auxy).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
If you wanted to do a 5/4 signature, <em>in Auxy</em>, with repeating segments that don’t use 4 bars (actual bars, not Auxy UI bars), then you’re in for a world of pain as you have to use a really horrible patchwork of bars and loop lengths to get it done.</p>
<p>Personally, if you’re attempting the above, I’d use something other than Auxy. It isn’t worth the pain.</p>
