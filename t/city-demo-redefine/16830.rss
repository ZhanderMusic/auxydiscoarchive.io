    <title>City (Demo/Redefine)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/city-demo-redefine/16830</link>
    <description>Hey guys!! So i finally remake this 3 years old track of mine. I did made some changes which is a lot. Im including this track to my upcoming album as well. However, im quite stuck on rebuilding the chorus and some verse that needs some tweak(kind of like under city feels and ambient). Im trying to add some good drop in the chorus. Any recommendations for drums and leads. Im really sure that this one is missing some elements.
