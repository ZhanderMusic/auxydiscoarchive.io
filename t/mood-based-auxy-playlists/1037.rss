    <title>Mood based Auxy playlists</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mood-based-auxy-playlists/1037</link>
    <description>Hi, everyone! So @stereofield and I have started a web-based app that will play Auxy songs based on a mood that you, the user, will choose. Our app runs off SoundCloud playlists.

As well as the playlists, we also curate Spotify compilations! Please note we will **not** release any tracks with out the original artists&#39; consent. A full version of the rules is available on our Discord server. 

Contact me or Stereofield for more information.
Website: auxmoods.github.io
SoundCloud: soundcloud.com/auxmoods
Compilation Submissions: coli.io/auxmoods (select Exclusive Post)
Discord: https://discord.gg/fCXK9GK

Thank you, and have a good day!</description>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>The way Auxmoods works is completely permissons-based. There are two ways to get featured on an Auxmoods compilation:</p>
<ol>
<li>You submit your song through our Coli network (<a href="http://coli.io/auxmoods">http://coli.io/auxmoods</a>) and thus give us permission to use your song. Again, the full terms are available on our Discord (link above).</li>
<li>We request to use your song, and you accept the terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, we’re not going to feature anything that we don’t have permission to distribute. If you’d like to be featured, either we’ll ask. you or you’ll ask us.</p>
