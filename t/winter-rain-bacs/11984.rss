    <title>Winter Rain - Bacs</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/winter-rain-bacs/11984</link>
    <description>So I made this demo track this past few days since it was a rainy week. This melody popped out in my head and played in my keyboard. It seem sounds nostalgic to me when I was playing it so I made into auxy and this is the outcome. Frankly im not quite done with this track yet so i posted this here to get a feedback atleast on what i can improve about this cinematic track. I’m not really satisfied about it yet. Hope you guys like it.

            <p>I could listen to this sort of stuff all day. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/black_heart.png?v=6" title=":black_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":black_heart:"></p>
<p>I’d definitely spend a little more time on the soundstaging.<br>
It felt like quite a few parts were sitting on top of each other to me.</p>

            <p>Really liked it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
Beautiful, simple refrain. Sparse and atmospheric.</p>
<p>A few thoughts…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think the percussion sound levels are a little higher than they should be. Just a little too present in the mix, imo.<br>
Or possibly shave off some brightness by dropping the LPF on them a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 1:24, I was anticipating a counter-melody to enter. Something light and airy, slightly arpeggiated, that wanders around a little, possibly busier, using every note-step as a brief counter to the sparseness of the main refrain.<br>
It lasts for a little while then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d pull back the delay a little. It adds a ‘swing’* that maybe doesn’t work in the context of this simple piece.<br>
* You seem to double-down on the swing at 1:48 with the main piano chords adopting the swung feel, when emphasising only the downbeat on your main 3/4 pattern has worked so well up to that point.<br>
(Not sure if it’s in the pattern or the delay effect.)<br>
May be just a taste thing, but that took something away from the piece for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feels like it needs a little building up to the impact at 1:47. Not too protracted, just something to build the anticipation ahead of the impact/pause. Maybe use the bass note on the piano chord repeatedly and bring up the volume gradually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, I’d remove all the delay on the instruments underneath the impact for the duration of that impact. It will purify the moment, imo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d cut out the section 2:48–3:12.<br>
This would result in going from a ‘peak’ to a sudden stripped back section – heightening the emotional impact.<br>
Currently, you use the above section to start winding down, but I’d recommend trying the sudden option to see if it creates more emotional impact (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/heathenaka/sketch-23/s-yR3gP#t=1:22">e.g.</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
