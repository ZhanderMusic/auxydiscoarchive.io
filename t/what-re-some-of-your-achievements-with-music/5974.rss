    <title>What’re some of your achievements with music?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-re-some-of-your-achievements-with-music/5974</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I’m new to this whole Auxy chat, but I’ve been playing music since I was but a young bull, and have just gained an interest in producing hip hop/ rap beats. In my life so far, I have had some pretty crazy opportunities, and achievements (in my opinion) brought forward through my music. I’ll share my experiences below later- but I was curious to know what everyone else’s achievements have been through either producing or other things such as playing in bands, contest winners, or artist recognitions- etc.</description>

            <p>Aww…thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a>!! You are too kind! Miss you too my guy.</p>
<p>I helped <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/morgen">@Morgen</a> get some songs distributed and hooked him up with some of the radio DJs that have played my music on their shows and he’s been getting some airplay.  He also remixed my song “November High” and I released that last Friday and it’s been getting airplay on several radio shows.</p>
<p>If you ever want to take the leap with us, just let me know and I’d be happy to help. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cheddr">@Cheddr</a> has been amazing with his generosity at helping others get exposure (if that’s what you’re interested in) and I’ve been trying to take his lead on that. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yaneeck">@yaneeck</a> has also been getting airplay and making connections and we’re all supporting each other (plus other non-Auxy artists we’ve connected with in the Twitter-sphere).  It’s been a hell of a lot of fun.</p>

            <p>That’s an impressive list of accomplishments <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cheddr">@Cheddr</a>!!  Agree 100% with everything you said. It’s been a really fun journey since I made the leap to getting my music distributed and self-promoting it on Twitter and other social platforms. Have to credit you for showing me the way and helping me get started.  Also really enjoying paying it forward.  <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yaneeck">@yaneeck</a> has also been making some waves and it’s so refreshing to see other Auxy producers getting some attention out there.  Keep up the good work buddy!!</p>

<p>Check out all of these awesome shows and stations, auxy friends! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/arrow_up.png?v=5" title=":arrow_up:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_up:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/darwinmcd">@darwinmcd</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/morgen">@Morgen</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/danbligity">@Danbligity</a>, and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fireframe">@FireFrame</a>  have been making waves in some of these places too.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about the Auxy bubble. Some general things I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <em>lots</em> of outlets that play creative independently produced electronic music. A lot of them are friendly to people that reach out to them politely, respectfully, and at least semi-professionally.</li>
<li>If you want to really break outside of that bubble your activity seems to need to be 80% promotion 20% production. Maybe or maybe not that is your thing and that is ok.</li>
<li>There are other bubbles, but they are bubbles too. Even within specific social platforms you may find many creative communities completely disconnected from each other. Try to reach into as many as you can if you like. But finding one (or a few) that you like might be plenty rewarding.</li>
<li>The skills for self promotion, pr, sales, project management, interpersonal skills, etc transfer to every single other thing you do in life. Its worth getting better at those things too. I am still.</li>
<li>You get what you give. Promoting other peoples music often gets them to notice yours (assuming its good). It feels good - like you are doing things “the right way”. I gave away copies of music from Bandcamp too people I’ve connected with along the way and have supported me.</li>
<li>Similarly, make sure you promote outlets that play your music (bloggers, playlisters, djs, etc). Its shocking how few people do that and it is important.</li>
<li>I hear it all the time but I’ll say it again, remember Auxy is just one of many tools. Not the sole definition of your music.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Haha i have an experience like that…</p>
<p>Getting a bit personal- my late father used to play this one Beach Boys song when we’d go camping when I was a kid. I loved it and always asked him to replay it over and over- I searched for around 4-5 years for it looking through albums on YouTube (I couldn’t find the CDs he had) &amp; finally found it at a county fair playing on a loudspeaker haha brought back the memories</p>
