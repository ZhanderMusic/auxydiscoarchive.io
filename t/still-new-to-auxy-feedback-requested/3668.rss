    <description>I&#39;m kind of still new to Auxy. I have made over 20 or more songs. I cant seem to wonder why other producers music sound so much better then mine. Just trying to get up with the league. Any tips or tricks that could help?

            <p>Ok, but don’t try too hard, cause you’ll end up with unfinished, flat and boring tracks.<br>
It’s the quality that counts, not the quantity.</p>

            <p>Hey man, don’t feel too bad. When I first started making music, everything was horrible. To be honest, even my parents said they were horrible. But, I kept trying, and then one day, I felt like I had finally done it. Everything requires effort. I’ve looked at your tracks, and they’re not far behind. Keep your head up and soon you’ll be “in the league”- whatever that means. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> And hey, we don’t judge. Anytime you need help you can ask us. You don’t have to be shy.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work,<br>
Voltt</p>

            <p>I recommend downloading some projects other producers have made (via the forum), and look at the techniques they’ve used. Take some inspiration when looking at the projects, and listen to some electronic artists and listen to their style to feel that “Hey maybe I can use this style in my song” vibe. Music to me is all about inspiration, emotion, and multiple personalities, and I feel that the best way to make a song is by first listening to many different songs by different artists to help get those music gears grinding!</p>
<p>Soon you may end up with such an amazing song, it’ll maybe even be put on the apps featured song! Just remember, aim high, do what you can do, and show us what ya got! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Remember, inspiration is what powers great songs, and great songs are made by the artists, weather they’re amazing and known, or lowkey and learning.<br>

            <p>Definitely! I’m sort of new to Auxy too. Just keep on making music and you’ll keep getting better. I’ve only been here like for a month or 2 and it’s already happening.</p>

            <p>Don’t be hard on yourself. I am super guilty of this, I hate most everything I make, but there are a few good ones, which I post. Part of the process of making something that you think sounds good is making things that don’t sound nearly as good. Whenever you feel like something isn’t quite right, ask someone for a second opinion, don’t just give up and say “well that idea didn’t work, I;m just going to throw it in the trash bin”. Also don’t worry about being in the “league”. Trying to make stuff to get you famous gets you nowhere, and fans you gain won;t be as genuine. Create what is <em>you</em> and people who like <em>you</em> will be drawn to your creations.</p>

            <p>Hey, don’t worry about being “in the league”, it just takes time and dedication. When you make a new song, have the mindset that it’s going to better than the last one in <em>some</em> way, whether it’s blending the instruments better, coming up with a cooler bassline, or trying out a new technique you learned. Always look for ways to improve. I’ve been making songs on Auxy for over a year now and I wasn’t really great at making songs when I first started (3 years prior to that I started making music with another app called Figure. My first songs ever were <strong>hot</strong> garbage). Even now I still think I have a ton of room to improve. Instead of hearing other people’s music and worrying about them being better, listen to what they do and see if you can do it too. It’s okay to steal some ideas from others (No, not like plagiarism, plagiarism is bad). I mean it’s okay if, say, you hear some sick wubs in a featured Auxy song and you try making those wubs in your own style to put in your own music. I figured out how to make those sweet, sweet future bass-y wubs just by listening to other Auxy artists do it. Don’t be afraid to ask us questions here on Disco, we’ll help you out. Lastly, and probably my favorite piece of advice, experiment! Fiddle around with Auxy. Try new things. Make weird noises. Do things that make no musical sense whatsoever (why not). You might just discover some cool new sounds to use in your music.</p>
<p>Oh and also, make it fun.</p>
<p>(I really like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/oshowdown-tropical-originalo">Showdown</a>, btw)<br>
That is all.</p>
