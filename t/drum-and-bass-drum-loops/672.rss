    <title>Drum and bass drum loops</title>

    <description>Decided to make some dnb drum loops as I think Auxy 4.0 will be great for making dnb. So without using soundpacks, I made this loops! https://app.auxy.co/projects/OPwObTf47WIEg3eFLSHI6Q== I&#39;d like to see what you do with these. To use them, copy the instrument containing the desired loop and paste it into a project. Feel free to edit any loops and change the instrument! Have fun!</description>
