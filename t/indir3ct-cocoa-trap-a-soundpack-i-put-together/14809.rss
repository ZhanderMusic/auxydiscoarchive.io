P.S. I just put together a little soundpack containing most of the samples I use in my tracks. Alot of artists have been asking about the diferent snares and brass samples that I use, so I thought I&#39;d put them In a pack. Here is the link, also you can access the Indipack anytime on my soundcloud page. Thanks!
