    <title>What type of Auxy music would be good in A Short Film?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-type-of-auxy-music-would-be-good-in-a-short-film/14464</link>
    <description>It&#39;s mostly in the title. I&#39;m planning to make a short film soon and I want to make the music using Auxy. The film will be about how powerful music is which is why I want to make most of the music myself. I was wondering what music in short films have inspired you or peaked your interest. Also, I&#39;d appreciate it if you guys could tell me what type of music would be interesting in a music-themed short film.</description>

            <p>Great use of piano and strings would be good, also use sweet saw because detuned saw waves are the best. Also try some arps with the new sound pack</p>
