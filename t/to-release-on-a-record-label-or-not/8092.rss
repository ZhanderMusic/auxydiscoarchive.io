    <description>Music labels.
Are they worth going for?

These days, digital-only music distribution is something you can easily handle yourself. So, that&#39;s no longer a reason to go for a label.

Labels, presumably, give the track the push, promotion and marketing that helps give a track/artist better reach, larger audiences and, ideally, better appreciation and rewards.

&amp;nbsp;
If getting your stuff released through a record label was a real possibility, but not a certainty, would you hold off on &#39;releasing&#39; tracks (albeit to limited state, using Soundcloud.

&amp;nbsp;

A part of me considers &#39;Auxy finished&#39; to mean &#39;Demo&#39; (i.e. not proper &#39;release-ready&#39;) and plans to work on them more, throw in some proper engineering, mixing and mastering (c/o a friend in the biz) and then talk with label contacts (also c/o the same friend).

Another part of me thinks my stuff is &#39;good enough&#39; and wants to get it out there, on Spotify, iTunes, etc…, to give them a better chance and see what happens.

&amp;nbsp;
So, that&#39;s where my head is at, at the moment.

Would be good to hear your thoughts on this question. Not what should _I_ do, but what&#39;s your view on the question…

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>It does. It’s why I recently turned down such an offer.</p>
<p>Their reach was significantly bigger than mine, but still effectively a tiny label.<br>
I’m not expecting magic, but I felt that, if I was going to get it on a label, I’d want a bit more boost than they could give.</p>

            <p>It all depends.</p>
<p>If the label would help you (get more play, fans, bookings, jobs) then release with them.<br>
Say, you’re a small time SC artist, 200+ followers, 300+ plays on each track…<br>
If you were able to release on a small label (3k followers, 5k plays), it would help you. It would push you to a level you previously weren’t on.</p>
<p>But, if you were to release on a tiny label (same or less followers/plays as yourself), releasing under them wouldn’t help you. They’d be doing what you could do yourself.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Ps. I am a small artist, and I own a tiny label, but the only reason my label is worth anything is because a release with me gives a professional cover art, and a professional mix and master, which a lot of people can’t do themselves.<br>
But, if they can do those things by themselves, they don’t need my label.</p>
