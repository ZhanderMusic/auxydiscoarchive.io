    <description>I made a playlist with a few WIP beats I&#39;ve been working on, and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s good or not as I&#39;m relatively new to this realm of things. Let me know down here or on the songs themselves what you guys like and what could be improved!

            <p>I listen to rap all the time, so here’s some feedback.</p>
<p>1- I like the melody in the beginning but not as much when the beat comes on. Other Han that it’s decent but not a fan of the lobster. The bass was a little annoying, maybe distort it some more and move some of the notes an octave up</p>
<p>2- really good, hi hats are way too loud though. Also a couple times the sidechain clicks.</p>
<p>3- not a fan of the snare. The hi hats could sink in a bit more imo.</p>
<p>4- snare is too quiet and not trappy enough. Not a big fan of the rides and slides the come in. Kick is weird</p>

            <p>As someone who’s realm is pretty much only hip hop, I can say that 2, and 3 were the best <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> - the percussions and melodies were what I would look for in a hip hop song- the instruments used were more “real” than those in track 1 and there was more control of the 808 and mix than track 4</p>
