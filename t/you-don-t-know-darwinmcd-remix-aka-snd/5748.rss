    <description>Hey Auxians!

AKA SND (@akabillposters) was gracious enough to let me remix one of his songs (“You Don’t Know”) that really inspired me when I first heard it.  Please check it out and let me know what you think.

            <p>Thank you sir!  I’m glad you approve.  It was truly an honor.</p>

<p>That was one of my favorite things about some (going old school now) early Depeche Mode and Erasure “remixes”, when awesome sounds/layers that I could barely hear in the original mix were highlighted in the remix. One that really stands out for me is this “clacking” synth sound in the chorus for DM’s “People Are People [Different Mix]”. It comes out prominently at about 5:19 (check it out: <a href="https://youtu.be/rY1xtk83GNk" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/rY1xtk83GNk</a>).  It’s very subtle during the chorus in the original/album mix…just moving along quietly in the background. But it’s such a bitchin sound…always thought they could have played it up more, which I was rewarded with that short snippet in the remix. There are other examples, but that one stands out to me the most.</p>
<p>Similarly, in “You Don’t Know”, I absolutely loved the layering bass sounds in the “Rest” after the chorus (brilliant composition IMHO) and knew I needed to do more with it (it’s only one bar), so I expanded it a bit in the middle and it became the outro in my remix.  For the outro, I realized parts of the chorus sounded really good with that single-note bass line.</p>
<p>Thanks again, brother.  Any other feedback is welcome. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/2.png?v=5" title=":+1:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t2:"></p>

            <p>Love it! Great, new vibe for the track.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on in my track, so to hear you pull out layers that play lesser roles and do more with them, it’s really interesting – and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Really enjoyed it (and will again, more than a few times, I’m sure) <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks so much for being up for it and really glad that you enjoyed working on it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’ll give it a few more listens and share some thoughts later today (or tomorrow), if you’d like.</p>
