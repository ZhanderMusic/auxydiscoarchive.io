    <title>Organising Your SoundCloud</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/organising-your-soundcloud/8085</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! so I have been doing some reading on how to grow your SoundCloud so I took my time to check over each track: Make sure all the tags are relevant, Make sure you have your name in each track so your audience can find it easier, update and organise your Descriptions, Organise your tracks by putting them in playlists so your audience can locate them easier. 

I took some time to do this and I encourage anyone who isn’t doing this try it out if they want to grow! Here is my organised playlists for example: 

Singles: https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/sets/singles 

Remixes: https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/sets/remixes 

Auxy • BTC’s: https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/sets/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-entrys 

Thats me for now! Again Try this out. 
Stay tuned!

            <p>Definitely agree that many here don’t really make the best use of the options available in SC, myself included.</p>
<p>Incorrect/meaningless genre tags have become a bit of a pet peeve of mine. It frustrates me when I see the profile/artist name used as the main genre tag (or even just ‘Auxy’).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you have your name in each track so your audience can find it easier,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Edit:</p>
<p>Thought you meant as a tag, but you mean in the title itself.</p>
<p>I can see this being used more and more. Probably helps establish name recognition.</p>
