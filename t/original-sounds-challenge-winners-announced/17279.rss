Click or tap the up arrow that is above this quote, to see the winner! It is right here, just wait…… :arrow_up:

Make your projects **only** using original sounds. Sweeper is allowed, but vocals are not allowed in this challenge. Also, for drums, you have to use original drums category only. The only categories that are allowed are trap, future bass, future house, electronic music, like electro house, drum and bass, and dubstep. **Dubstep** songs get a **10% bonus** in the challenge because they are hard to make, and drum and bass is also hard to make, and that gives **drum and bass a 5% bonus** also. This challenge will be graded on effort, creativity, quality, and sound. Remember to use your best effort, because I can give you a good ranking if I see you put hard work into it. Tracks must be posted before *January 10, 2019*. The winners will be chosen by *January 15, 2020*, but I chose them early. Hope you enjoy! :slightly_smiling_face:

[quote]
* The track must follow every rule up above
* Any link is allowed, SoundCloud, project files and even uncompressed WAV

Prize: Will help you on **any** WIP track you need help in (Do not judge me because I am still learning how to make good songs), and a mention on my user card.</description>

<p>I made this song a week ago with all the classic sounds on auxy! in fact, all songs on my channel are made with classic auxy, since i used an outdated version of auxy on my old ipad. my project: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ek5btfdSj8" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ek5btfdSj8</a></p>
<p>Edit: i only have the old mechanics on auxy, so this is really classic auxy!</p>

            <p>The original sounds. Fortunately, you can download egg and pasta from original sounds form Cloud. You can play around with those so you can enter. Whether you can use the instruments to find out ways to make melodic percussion, or I can give you a -10% using the non-original demo drums. Another option is to use no drums at all.</p>

            <p>So, by original sounds, does this mean that we have to use the Free sounds or the Auxy Original ones? Because I don’t have a Premium account and can not use the paid sounds.<br>
Also, my songs aren’t really good, so I don’t know if I should post them, they were all made with free sounds</p>

            <p>Okay, see if you can edit the track and make it better and also make sure it follows the category. If you want, you can also make a new track bc you have two and a half months before the deadline.</p>
