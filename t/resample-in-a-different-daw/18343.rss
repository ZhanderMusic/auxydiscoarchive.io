    <title>Resample in a different DAW</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/resample-in-a-different-daw/18343</link>
    <description>I have no idea where this should go so its going here ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Are there any Logic Pro X users, and if so, how much would you benefit from an Alchemy pack made from most synths in Auxy (if against ToS then I won&#39;t do it)? I for one would benefit greatly and tbh the synths are super easy to sample with Alchemy, which would give me a little bit more workability with probably the best presets in the game, with having access to OTT/Ozone/Sosig Fattener without having to bounce the WAVs every time I wanna make a change.

I just think it would be a really cool thing, and if its not against Auxy ToS then I defo wanna do it and release it here, free ofc</description>

            <p>That said, there‚Äôs no reason why you can‚Äôt export stems to another DAW and use whatever FX chain you want, that‚Äôs cool obviously. You just can‚Äôt repackage these sounds and distribute them.</p>
