    <title>Can&#39;t get likes anymore, demotivated /:</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/cant-get-likes-anymore-demotivated/1781</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not getting SC likes anymore and it&#39;s kinda lead to me running out of inspiration and ideas. Back in May I got 600+ plays on my tracks without an Auxy repost. Now it&#39;s 10-20 plays with 4 or 5 likes. And I know that its all about how good the music is. And sometimes you have to ask yourself if that 10 plays is worth the 4+ hours spent on Auxy daily. Haywire came out of nowhere. And when I say that I mean nobody knew who was until about 2 weeks ago and he&#39;s already making hundreds of plays, how? Besides my friends Phoenix &amp; NYC have been noticed and they&#39;ve been around as long as me. I&#39;m also trying to spread to places outside of Auxy, like promotion channels and such. Hours spent finding a relevant and active promo channel, submitting the track, just for it not even be touched. Or it gets rejected. I hope to one day get my track reposted on Auxy and start getting listeners again. Nowadays all I want is someone new to discover my tracks. This isn&#39;t some corny self-promo, all I want is advice from someone. Please?!</description>

            <p>Thats the music industry for you</p>
<p>If you’re getting an artists block, have someone criticize your work and do better or something, You can also make music for fun or pretend that you have alot of plays, which i do all the time.</p>
