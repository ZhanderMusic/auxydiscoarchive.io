My take on VVVVVV&#39;s soundtrack song, Potential for Anything. Originally by Magnus Pålsson, also known as SoulEye. Please purchase the official soundtrack! 

Original: https://souleyedigitalmusic.bandcamp.com/album/pppppp-the-vvvvvv-soundtrack

Had a lot of fun with this song, special thanks to the people on the YSAP discord for helping me learn how to mix this track better. Without you guys, this track wouldn&#39;t nearly be as awesome.
