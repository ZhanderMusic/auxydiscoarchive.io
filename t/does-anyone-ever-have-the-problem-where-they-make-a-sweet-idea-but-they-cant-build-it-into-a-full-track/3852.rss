            <p>I do all the time, sometimes I’ll mess with all the different synths. Other times I’ll just leave the main part of the idea and come back later, one time I didn’t work on a song for about 5 months. Came back, changed the tempo and some other details, added in a beat, done. A real sexy trap Beat.</p>

            <p>The dreaded 8 bar loop. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/pensive.png?v=5" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:"><br>
Gets me a lot, here are some helpful vids on that issue.</p>
<p>1.)<br>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qA8tTd2mRY?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qA8tTd2mRY</a></p><p></p>
<p>2.)<br>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qr0ed0ACxsE?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qr0ed0ACxsE</a></p><p></p>
<p>I also remember someone saying that the 8 bar loop problem(stuck), happens because you do not have a clean ideal of how the song will be structured. Write down how you want the structure to be, then work within those boundaries.<br>
Some of this might be hit or miss, but hopefully something works.</p>

            <p>Getting ‘<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=stuck+in+4+bar+loop">stuck in a 4 bar loop</a>‘ is quite a common issue for music makers.</p>
<p>Like many here, I have a shedload of undeveloped ideas; typically 4-8 bar ‘scraps’ sitting on the back burner, each of which could form the backbone of a new piece, if only I could figure out a direction for them.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are lots of creators offering <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=stuck+in+4+bar+loop">potential ways to break out of it</a>.</p>
