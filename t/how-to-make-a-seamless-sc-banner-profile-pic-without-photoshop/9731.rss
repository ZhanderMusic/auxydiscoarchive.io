    <title>How to Make a Seamless SC Banner &amp; Profile Pic Without Photoshop</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-make-a-seamless-sc-banner-profile-pic-without-photoshop/9731</link>
    <description>A lot of people I know have been wondering how to make one of those SC banners and profile photos that blend with each other. Here&#39;s a way to do it without photoshop or any fancy tool, just [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) (a free and easy online tool that a lot of us use) and [Lunapic&#39;s Transparent Background Editor](https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent) (also free). If you want, you can use another transparent bg editor.

1. Get a computer. xD
2. Download an image that you want as your banner (and part of your profile photo). Make sure it&#39;s free... A good website to use is [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). It&#39;s also best to choose an image that will fit under your logo color-scheme wise.
3. Open Canva (if you haven&#39;t used it before, you&#39;ll need to create an account). Under &quot;Create a Design&quot;, choose &quot;more&quot; and then scroll down to SoundCloud banner. It has the exact dimensions for an SC banner.

4. Upload the image you downloaded (banner). You can play around with the filters if you like.
5. Open [Lunapic](https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent) and upload **your SC profile photo. It needs to be square**. Unfortunately, this&#39;ll really only work for graphic logos (not as well for actual, realistic images with a lot of color, etc.)
6. Click on the parts you want to make transparent (the background of your logo. So for me, that would be the white background.) Then you&#39;ll be left with just your logo.

     ![image|356x360](upload://g2269u9vmS1691ubavF8UuKaAIc.jpeg)

7. Download the new image. Open it on the same SC banner Canva page you had.
8. Resize your profile photo with the dots surrounding it. As you resize the image, you&#39;ll see a small set of numbers. Resize until it&#39;s **400x400**.

    ![57%20PM|428x258](upload://fEoToiZKPzaWRP5yZPWp0HrQDsP.png)

9. Now, you&#39;ll need to move the profile photo left and right by dragging it. You&#39;ll also see a small set of numbers. Keep dragging until it says **60,60**. Do the same thing for dragging up and down-- untill you see **60,60**. This means that the profile picture is 60 pixels away from the top, left, and bottom sides of the banner.

10. Now, all you need to do is screenshot the portion of your banner that has your profile photo. (to screenshot on a Mac, press shift+command+4). Try to make sure it&#39;s square (you should also see a small set of numbers [dimensions]). Upload this as your profile photo.

11. Then, delete the profile photo on your Canva banner so that it&#39;s just the image you&#39;re using for your banner. Download the image and upload it as your banner photo.

Tada! The end result should look something like this.

Hope this helped!</description>

            <p>Obviously, a 1000 x 1000 px won’t fit within a 520px high banner, so to get optimal results, things get a bit more complex.</p>

            <p>A lot of people I know have been wondering how to make one of those SC banners and profile photos that blend with each other. Here’s a way to do it without photoshop or any fancy tool, just <a href="https://www.canva.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Canva</a> (a free and easy online tool that a lot of us use) and <a href="https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent" rel="nofollow noopener">Lunapic’s Transparent Background Editor</a> (also free). If you want, you can use another transparent bg editor.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Upload the image you downloaded (banner). You can play around with the filters if you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <a href="https://www141.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent" rel="nofollow noopener">Lunapic</a> and upload <strong>your SC profile photo. It needs to be square</strong>. Unfortunately, this’ll really only work for graphic logos (not as well for actual, realistic images with a lot of color, etc.)</p>

<p>Click on the parts you want to make transparent (the background of your logo. So for me, that would be the white background.) Then you’ll be left with just your logo.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Download the new image. Open it on the same SC banner Canva page you had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resize your profile photo with the dots surrounding it. As you resize the image, you’ll see a small set of numbers. Resize until it’s <strong>400x400</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, you’ll need to move the profile photo left and right by dragging it. You’ll also see a small set of numbers. Keep dragging until it says <strong>60,60</strong>.

<p>Tada! The end result should look something like this.</p>
