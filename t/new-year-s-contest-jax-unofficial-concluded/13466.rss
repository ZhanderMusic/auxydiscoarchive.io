    <title>New Year‚Äôs Contest - Jax (unofficial) (concluded)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-year-s-contest-jax-unofficial-concluded/13466</link>
    <description>**This competition is over.**

**Disclaimer:** 
this is an unofficial contest.

**Description:** 
I made this contest because I wanted to hear how different creators could take one chord progression and turn it into their own song. Top three - five (depending on the number of submissions) will get their track featured in an album I‚Äôll post on soundcloud along with one of my songs using the same chord progression.

**Rules:**
The only rule is that you use this chord progression throughout your song. You are welcome to change the key, the instrument, etc. just as long as you don‚Äôt change the chords. Get creative and make it your own. You are welcome to change the rhythm of the chords as well.

Be sure to post your soundcloud or auxy project here, and not in the finished projects section

There will be 3 winners. The contest will end **January 14th.** I will announce the winners shortly after. 
 
**Winners:**
seen as that i wanted to make an album with the winners, and that we only have four submissions, I  didnt feel like it would be fair to have all just three winners. I know this is kinda cheesey, but everyone is a winner! I will be posting the album later today. 

P.S. Thanks to you all that actually do participate!üòÑ

    Hello everyone! 
On the first day of the year, I held a contest, and I intended on having multiple winners. Only a few participated though, so I figured I would thank everyone who did participate by posting their songs.

<p>Congrats to everyone then and thanks Jax, for the challenge.  Had me thinking a bit differently, especially having to actually write a melody (and multiple ones at that)</p>
