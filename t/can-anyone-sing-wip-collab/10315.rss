    <title>Can Anyone Sing? (WIP) [Collab?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/can-anyone-sing-wip-collab/10315</link>
    <description>So I was making a melody with some chords, and when I was making this track, I realized that the track couldn’t be a full one without vocals, because it was hard to build with that melody (Piano), so I was wondering if someone can sing and possibly collab with me
