    <title>WAKE - Unknown (Bass)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/wake-unknown-bass/20311</link>
    <description>Aight, I know I’m just another person in the auxy community but I have a bunch of songs to put out before I’m gone for the next 2 years. I’m gonna post 1 a day until they’re all out, some of these are older and have just been sitting around, some are me messing around and it turning into something short, and some are songs that have gone through my emotions.

Hopefully if you check this one out you’ll listen to the rest! I’ll probably post them from least favorite to favorite. I hope you guys like at least one of em!
