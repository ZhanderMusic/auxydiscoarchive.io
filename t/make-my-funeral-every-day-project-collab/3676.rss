    <title>Make My Funeral Every Day [Project, Collab]</title>

I was watching @Produk ‘s wub video and then I got carried away with making Freak talk, definitely have to fiddle with tone and shape with your lowpass to get the vowel sounds.

Historically, I use a bit crusher to amplify the effect but we have no such tool yet. That’s how ya get the real throaty sounds in my experience (cut higher frequencies on your filter and turn up (down?) the bit rate).

Anyway, for anyone who wants to bastardize this have at it :smiley:</description>

            <p>I remember when Reason 4 came out one of the top level patches for Thor was the synth saying “I am Thor”. I’m still not really 100% howdafuq it was built but I remember it pretty much blowing my mind even if it’s musically useless lol</p>
