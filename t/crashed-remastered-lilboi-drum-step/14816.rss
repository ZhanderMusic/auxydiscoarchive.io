    <title>Crashed Remastered - LilBoi [drum step]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/crashed-remastered-lilboi-drum-step/14816</link>
    <description>I made the original version of this track over one year ago when I had just downloaded the first version of Auxy which had the green logo. I had made couple tracks before this but I wasn’t sure if I liked Auxy yet. There was something in this certain track that I liked very much back then and still do. I don’t really know what it is because this song isn’t very versatile and it’s not the best one I have made, but there was still something in it what made me fall in love with Auxy.
