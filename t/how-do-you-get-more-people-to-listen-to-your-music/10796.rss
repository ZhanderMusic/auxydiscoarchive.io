    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-do-you-get-more-people-to-listen-to-your-music/10796</link>
    <description>It may sound like a silly question but I have a few tracks on my soundcloud with the highest viewed track at 18 views. I‚Äôm not trying to generate money from my music, I just want more people to listen and provide me with feedback so I can develop further as a producer.</description>

            <p>My best advice for getting more recognition is getting in contact with other artists and forming partnerships.  Between you and the other artists you support each other‚Äôs music so you‚Äôll be getting plays from them and in many cases you‚Äôll be reposting each other‚Äôs music, allowing for that other artists audience to check out your music as well.  It‚Äôs always good to make connections with othersüòÑ</p>

            <p>If scouting through Discord servers, try to find ones that have other channels, such as YT, SC or even a popular Spotify playlist.</p>
<p>Alternatively, track down the community spots (incl. discord servers, etc‚Ä¶) for popular promo/repost channels and labels ‚Äì and try to get on those.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Once you‚Äôre in one discord server it‚Äôs pretty easy to find others through personal referrals and official label partnerships. For example, the Lunchbox discord might link to other discords that are part of the Lunchbox network in its information channel such as Ridgeline. It‚Äôs the domino effect in action.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also a good strategy to go out and look for labels on SoundCloud‚Äìit‚Äôs a good bet that some of the bigger and more active ones will have an official discord server.</p>
<p>Then there‚Äôs the more annoying but still effective way of going onto certain discord servers called ‚ÄúListing servers‚Äù, which is basically a place where everyone posts servers organized by type. You‚Äôll have to sift through some of the inactive or less popular ones but you‚Äôll get a good bunch for your efforts.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd recommend not to focus solely on discord servers though‚Äìa lot of people have the promotion channels muted and your track usually gets buried within the day or even a few hours. Focus on making legitimate connections with other artists and building an active, engaged, and dedicated audience. There are also other much more effective ways to promote yourself via. websites and networks such as Repost Exchange.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a list of servers that I personally frequent to get you started on your discord endeavors:</p>
<p>Phuture Collective Discord - <a href="https://discord.gg/eTDkBD5" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/eTDkBD5</a><br>
<em>18k follower label with a weekly live feedback session.</em></p>
<p>BONSAI Collective Discord - <a href="https://discord.gg/QgnEwvV" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/QgnEwvV</a><br>
<em>Run by Capshun, also largely involved with Phuture Collective.</em></p>
<p>LUNCHBOX Discord - <a href="https://discord.gg/squanZF" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/squanZF</a><br>
<em>Like BONSAI, it has a channel for repost trading with other members.</em></p>
<p>Dreamscape Public - <a href="https://discord.gg/kuq8n8V" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/kuq8n8V</a><br>
<em>High quality label, with a decently active discord community.</em></p>
<p>Radon Recordings - <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/jV4aQRh" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discordapp.com/invite/jV4aQRh</a><br>
<em>Great for feedback and has a highly engaged community.</em></p>
<p>Remember to prioritize your long term loyal fanbase over anything. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Share it with people you know. Family, friends, teachers‚Ä¶ anyone you think will be interested. Maybe they‚Äôll like it and share it with others. I‚Äôve noticed a few of my friends post links on their social media to tracks I‚Äôve shown them that they liked. I‚Äôd definitely recommend starting by just spreading to people you know.</p>

            <p>Advertising is good. Of course, we don‚Äôt want to advertise on every single forum thread. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs against forum rules anyways.</p>
<p>But, I guess it comes down to patience. People wander around listening to different sounds and styles. That‚Äôs how I get into most artists.<br>
Also, as <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> suggested, branch out! I upload my songs on both YouTube and SoundCloud, but not everything fits on SoundCloud (I‚Äôm not buying a membership subscription yet) so it‚Äôs nice to have other sites where you can upload more, like YouTube, which has pretty much infinite upload time. (Just be wary of the <em><strong>absolute garbage</strong></em> copyright system that YT has. Remixes can and <em>will</em> get striked and taken down. I can tell you that that has happened to me, and I have to wait until late August for the claim to expire.)</p>
<p>Sharing songs around with others also works. If you have friends and family who might enjoy it, send it to them! Ask them to maybe share it around with their friends! You‚Äôre bound to grow an audience somehow, even if they‚Äôre just people you know. They‚Äôll still support you.</p>
<p>Good luck! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>The obvious solution here is to keep your own tracks on repeat using a different account until you buildup hundreds of plays.</p>
<p>No but fr it took me a very long time before I got plays of any significance and even then they aren‚Äôt ever consistent and not usually very high.</p>
<p>But Definitely do all the things the guys above have suggested.</p>

            <p>Here are some strategies I‚Äôve used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure to put tags on your music, as many as make sense, this will bring streams from stations and related tracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send your music to people! Really! Most people are fine with it. If they don‚Äôt get back to you, then let them be, but many people, including me, are happy to listen and even potentially give feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in the community, name recognition is important, the more people know your name, the more likely they are to open your threads and tracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browse SoundCloud, both within the Auxy community and other artists and be supportive! Be sure to leave a lot of likes and comments, people will often return the favor and it will also bring more traffic to your profile if people see you around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Join Discord servers, there are a bunch <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-discord-directory-for-chatty-chatty/7585">here</a> for the Auxy community but also many others out there. Take advantage of any promotion or feedback channels accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Providing feedback for sure, being engaged with others here. Participating in the various contests definitely helps.</p>
<p>Outside of here, spread your work around. Post on the Audiobus forum, other music forums (not even just mobile music, the line is getting very blurry nowadays). Make sure you tag your uploads on SC accurately and with as many tags that make sense (I find a good chunk of the plays I do have come from their ‚Äúrelated songs‚Äù algorithms, which I presume SC bases on genre and tagging).</p>
