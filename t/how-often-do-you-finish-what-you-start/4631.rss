            <p>I have hundreds of unfinished projects and a whole bunch on my google drive i can’t access when i was clearing space before the apple files update. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
I usually put them down until i learn more and can come back and perfect an idea.</p>

            <p>Me: I tend to get an intro, and a buildup to my first drop, but then, I have a difficult time finding the balance between repetition and introducing new material.<br>
I feel like this is a major hurdle I have to clear before I can get recognized as a songwriter/producer.</p>

            <p>If I compare the number of starter ideas, loops, etc… I’ve created to the number of tracks I’ve put on SC, I fall somewhere between ‘Sometimes’ and ‘Almost never’.</p>
<p>If I’m talking about whether I’m happy to sign-off on anything I’ve created so far as being finished, final and ‘ready for release’, that drops to ‘Never’.</p>

            <p>i usually get like 70% of the way done with the track itself.  But i can never get around to actually ever finishing them. They just kind of sit there on my computer, nearly done, but not really good yet.</p>

            <p>It’s somewhere between sometimes and almost always. I have like 20 or so untitled projects that are literally a single loop it’s kinda crazy xD but usually I’ll stick with an idea if it’s more than me messing around.</p>
