    <title>Release single collaboration or wait</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/release-single-collaboration-or-wait/7139</link>
    <description>So I have something special in the works for everyone. 

MARBLED GLASS was meant to be my last single before this. though this could be a while. 

I would like to release a line of collaborations with artists who would be interested; with a few in the works already. 

please tell me your thoughts of what you would like to hear and whether you’d wait or have some singles thrown in to fill up the space.</description>

            <p>I’d recommend shooting for a time between a week or two weeks for a given song or collaboration or even remix to be released, it all depends on what you feel most comfortable with</p>

            <p>I’d say collaborations are just as important as releasing singles on a schedule. Just my two cents xD they should be considered part of the schedule in that way</p>
