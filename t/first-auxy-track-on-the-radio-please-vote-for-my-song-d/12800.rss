    <title>First Auxy track on the radio? Please vote for my song :D</title>

    <description>Hey guys! I am so happy that one of our national radio station in Sweden took my song in for voting to be played on radio over the next week.
I am not sure, but could that be the first Auxy track to be played on radio? I am sorry if I have missed you other guys’s tracks if this has happened before.

If you want to take a second I would be thrilled to get a vote or two :smile:

Here:  http://p3osignat.sverigesradio.se/submission/10614716

Just click on the heart, and use one of the ways to log in (google, twitter etc) - it only takes a second!


Woo, I an so psyched, hope I get played :smiley:
Thanks guys!</description>
