    <title>Quantum Descent (feat. Selly) [Synthwave/Timescape Pt. 2]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/quantum-descent-feat-selly-synthwave-timescape-pt-2/12896</link>
    <description>So here’s the tea: I got this request from @Selly (real standup guy, go check him out on sc) to do a collab but I wasn’t into synthwave yet, it was a couple months ago, and so we both didn’t know what to do with the amazingness that was Selly’s project file... so later on he says “it’s not my style, you can do whatever you want with it” so I look back at it and *ding* **idea** ... I make a sequal to Timescape. In the spirit of good sportsmanship and musicality, I’m still giving Selly credits because it was his initial work that was most of the basis for this amazing track so here: https://soundcloud.com/insolidaritymusic/quantum-descent-1
Enjoy! As always feedback is appreciated, and while you’re at it, check out (slightly edited version of) Timescape: https://soundcloud.com/insolidaritymusic/timescape-official-pt-1
Both will be in stores under a single shortly</description>
