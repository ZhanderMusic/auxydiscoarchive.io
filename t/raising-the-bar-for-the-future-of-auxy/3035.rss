    <description>### On a mission to change music
It&#39;s been 4 years since @Fredrik and I started Auxy. Our goal was to bring serious music production to mobile and empower a new generation of creators. We set out to build a different type of music app—simple yet powerful—that makes it easy to explore and realize your creative potential.

### How far have we come?
I think the best way to judge our progress is to listen to tracks made by the community. We&#39;ve been repeatedly amazed by how your music gets better with every app release. Quite frankly, we haven&#39;t heard any tracks made in other mobile apps that come anywhere close to what you guys are releasing. By making such great music, you make us confident that we can push the bar even further, and give us the energy to keep pushing.

### Who will make the first big hit on mobile?
We think that mobile music is at an inflection point, so we wanted to take a step back and reflect on how we can take things to the next level. With the number of quality tracks we see today, we&#39;re confident that it&#39;s a matter of time before we start hearing big hits produced on mobile. Our goal is to make Auxy the platform where the first big mobile hit gets made. Most people don&#39;t understand the impact of this shift yet, but we hope that you are as excited as we are about taking the lead and shaping the future of music.

### What should we invest in?
In order to take things things to the next level, we think it is important to invest in the following areas:
- Drastically expand the sound library with world class content that covers many different styles
- Add ways to import personal sounds and create limitless possibilities for making unique sounding tracks
- Add new effects and more controls for shaping sounds
- Rework how to build and arrange songs
- Add new ways to create melodies and rhythms
- Improve the workflow so that the app feels lighter, even as we&#39;re adding more features
- Make it easier to share and collaborate on projects
- Make it possible to capture voice and release fully featured tracks

### How can we move faster?
We&#39;re only two people working on Auxy, and this prevents us from building a lot of the things that we&#39;d love to add. We want to move faster and aim a lot higher. In order to do so, we need to find a way to make more money so that we can reinvest in developing Auxy further.

### What&#39;s next?
We&#39;re working on a big release that will bring some fundamental changes to our current model and address some of the things listed above. We&#39;re excited to tell you more about the new version in the coming weeks and get your feedback on our plans for the future.

Thanks for your support and high five for the future!</description>

<ul>
<li>Drastically expand the sound library with world class content that covers many different styles</li>
<li>Add ways to import personal sounds and create limitless possibilities for making unique sounding tracks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These two were accomplished in v5.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add new effects and more controls for shaping sounds</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is still in the process, if at all?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rework how to build and arrange songs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>5.1, but personally I do not like the rework of the interface, as it personally fails to improve workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add new ways to create melodies and rhythms</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure how this could even be possible, but it’s not ready yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve the workflow so that the app feels lighter, even as we’re adding more features</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow shift from v4 to v5 was a drastic change, but in ways the app felt lighter. The introduction of more instrument slots and the condensation of drum kits without having to use multiple for just one sound certainly helped.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to share and collaborate on projects</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as it’s always been, pretty easy but could be improved.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make it possible to capture voice and release fully featured tracks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nada.</p>
<hr>
<p>So there’s only a few we necessarily need updates on, I’m definitely interested in seeing that.</p>

            <p>Agreed—liveplay would be the best. I was thinking drum pads, too—as far as time signature goes, it occurred to me that a “snap” Option next to the “Soft” button could turn any unquantized notes quantized to any one signature of your choice. That, or perhaps live play doesn’t produce actual notes—it just overlays a graphic of the played pattern over the sequencer in the loop. This way, you still have to input melodies manually, but with the guidance of the “ghost” of what you just played.</p>
<p>This way sharing projects with liveplayed, unquantized notes via link wouldn’t crash the mobile phone.</p>
<p>That or every note is now interpreted by the app as on a 1/192 scale, so duples and triples alike fit in, and all liveplay automatically snaps to those specifics.</p>
<p>Probably how most apps with duple and triple time work anyways.</p>

<p>That seems their go-to response for anything they don’t consider important, so they blame something else. That’s the impression I get :\</p>

            <p>They just need live recording with Figure style keyboard and a live erase button, midi, etc. So what? It worked well once before it can work again for Auxy.  Because I personally can’t be bothered anymore to painstakingly program melodies when I have half a dozen other apps where I can just shred them out live on the screen.  But the problem is they made the sequencer such that even alternate time signatures would require a complete rewrite of the sequence according to past comments, that doesn’t bode well for EVER getting live recording unfortunately.  Also, Lenberg implied to me a while back that he didn’t view live playing on a touchscreen as a viable option.  To which I replied with a laundry list of iOS apps that have it successfully implemented.  Never heard back after that.   So I really don’t know what they can do besides build a FOURTH iteration of Auxy that is subscription from day one and has some of these features.  Hopefully constructed in such a way that makes it way way easier to build upon over time.  Cause I feel like a lot of these requests are met with responses to the effect of “well we can’t do that because of the way the engine works and it would be a big task, etc, etc”</p>

<p>This. It’s as simple as this. If it was free and we were complaining then I’d say we’re really just a bunch of self absorbed over indulgent… turd… burgers.</p>
<p>This applies to anything that costs money. I have a problem with my TV service and internet at my house. I’ve called the cable company multiple times, I’m met with apathy and no clear idea why there are problems.</p>
<p>Guess who is switching to a different provider?</p>

            <p>Indeed. A simple FAQ’s page would help eliminate a lot of the repeated questions.</p>
<p>Or rather, laying out a roadmap with all important features in consideration would help as well. If they really were planning to release packs that people keep asking, I’m sure we’d stop asking for them. As I currently see it though, they don’t really show any intention of such things.</p>
<p>In addition, looking back over the post made me realize that a potential reason for the hostile response I received from Lenberg could be in part due to me suggesting they let the users decide a bit on upcoming features for the app. Which only cements the secrecy and silence they have as to the future Auxy holds. It’s their vision or no vision, which isn’t a very good attitude to have.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Auxy shouldn’t be expected to see every single thing users nag them for, though, should they?<br>
…<br>
It’s a bit selfish to get mad at them not giving you, one of thousands of users, attention for whatever you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Nagging’ implies repeated requests - so, yes, they should be engaging with recurring requests.</p>
<p>As mentioned, a quick acknowledgement is better for their reputation than behaving in a way that fosters the idea that they’re ignorant to the concerns of users.</p>
<p>They simply need to be better at this - or kill this masquerade that they’re actually listening once and for all.</p>
<p>‘Managing expectations’ is a thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>their focus is more (and rightly so) on building the app [and addressing things in real life outside of development, potentially] rather than fishing through thousands of comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They need to find a way to do both. That’s the nature of running a business today.<br>
If they can’t handle that, then they’ve misjudged the whole venture.</p>
<p>(Tbh, I’m not particularly impressed by the results of the last six months’ effort.</p>
<p>Afaik, L isn’t a dev, but certainly is the owner/manager with a background in marketing, which puts marketing squarely on his desk. If he’s not a dev, then I really don’t know what’s he’s been busy on for the past six months.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’m not intentionally goading them, but I’m aware that I’m getting close to the knuckle on some of my comments. It’ll be interesting to see how Auxy handles/reacts to that kind of criticism.</p>
