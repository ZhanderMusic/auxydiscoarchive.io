    <title>Don’t Stop - Trey [edm, demo included!]</title>

Here is my latest track! Shout to @xavior for helping me out with the cover art! This one was lots of fun to make, hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do! 
I’m also going to start including demos of my songs whenever I upload to try and give people a snippet of what’s actually going on! Treat this exactly as you would an in-app feature. If somebody misuses this I will stop.

You are free to use the custom drum kit I made (I named it Resonate) but please don’t copy the loops.
Thank you!</description>
