hey guys I recorded a lil demo that i’m gonna incorporate into my project called “ICON”. 

Take a listen if ya’ll want ❤️ plus play if you wanna play with the project here it is:

https://app.auxy.co/projects/vlzD3-aD2YqgY1F8BAisdQ==

it’s simple, i’ll share some more that are viable stand alone that could be exciting to mess with

Cost - LYRICS

skip school all to build up a collection of IP

bad boys I look up to say it’s really unlikely that i’ll reach my dreams

statistically, we’re talking

move your pen, but can you walk it

character traits, missions, unlock it

keep going there’s no stopping

move your body to the drum ooo

awakening, never numb

feeling fine I promise you

hustla! doing what I gotta do

chorus:

nothing’s free in life

you see there is a cost

trading all my time for assets I build on

but when the challenges come

you know that I take em on

unzipping my pants

grab my phone, takin them off

do it for the money

you can’t drop the ball

give up every part of you 

image and all 

okay

unveiling every “flaw”

think money is the answer

but there’s a cost

and when you’re an ICON

that they’ve got their eyes on

I hope you’re happy in your skin, silence all talk

shutter over here

over there, every where

they’ll never see you crying cuz they’re looking at your hair

*end of chorus*

all lights and smiles, follow what you see on screen

i’m blue, indigo, got soul in me

send in your assessments without ever knowing me

I’ll take the lead, i’ll walk it

paths for you and me - free

LGBT Q

all, every color and hue, BOLD brilliance

side to side with a jump uh

electric mind, never dumb

feeling fine I promise you

ICON, doing what I gotta do

(chorus)

you see, God 1st and everything is after

they’re laughing at you, so make money off their laughter

they wanna see so you put on a show

and after that back to your room all alone

you see, I bleed, I cry

no matter where I go I can only be so high

no matter where I’ve been, I can never run and hide

you wanna be an star, living an ICONIC life

nothing’s free in life

we all pay a different price

live on different sets

making different sacrifices

but may our virtues outweigh our vices

every stranger can have my kindness

curious eyes, pupils widest

look to the shine, but don’t be blinded

we are ICONS from the day that we are born til the day we’re gone &amp; beyond</description>
