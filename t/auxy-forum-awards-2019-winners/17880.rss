Honorable mention...  Shoutout to all the moms out there! I know my mother has to put up with me blaring my Auxy tracks and projects all the time, but she still listens and tells me theyâ€™re pleasant...even though they probably arenâ€™t ðŸ˜‚.

Letâ€™s make 2020 an amazing year, canâ€™t wait to see what you can come up with.</description>

            <p>What a great year. So happy for our winners! Serpâ€™s tracks all blew me away this year and certainly my favorite producer of the year.  As for Mr. Mooo, itâ€™s awesome to see how far heâ€™s come since our first collab a few years back. Lastly, Paradise '87 was incredible and deserves a spot as well. Canâ€™t wait to see this new year!</p>
