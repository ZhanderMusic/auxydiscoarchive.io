    <title>A Record Label Owned by Auxy?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-record-label-owned-by-auxy/5612</link>
    <description>I have an idea that @Auxy or the auxy team should take into consideration: an auxy label. This is a good idea because it gives people an opportunity to get noticed. Share your thoughts with me and like this topic if you agree</description>

            <p>And that’s totally cool cause most labels deal in what they like/want to put out. If there was an Auxy label it’d be whatever those guys like and that’s totally fine cause that’s how it works (not trying to res the other discussion).</p>
<p>So anyone who wants to do it then go for it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Team Auxy have already given their blessing for the community to run with the ball. Again, I’d just hate to see dev time sucked up for this.</p>

            <p>I think it would ruin the joy of making music of Auxy imo if there was an intergrated record label.</p>
<p>I think so many people would get caught up in the fact of making music to submit for the label, sending it to the label, and then getting a negative response back if their track wasn’t good enough. This would then lead to less motivation with making music with Auxy and lead to some people to not like making music with Auxy anymore. This would lead people to go into other directions (i.e. different apps or DAWs) to make/produce music.</p>
<p>Additional note:<br>
And plus, if people still think the reposts are biased, who’s to say the record label/collective wouldn’t be as well.</p>

            <p>Audiotool does something similar, they “release” albums through their platform and if I’m not mistaken the songs are fully remixable by the community. They also do compilation albums.</p>
<p>I’ve got to agree though, I’d really rather the guys focus on the app and not get so involved in this side of things that it takes time away from features and updates. Not to mention I have no idea how they’d monetize this where clearly the app and IAP is what’s putting food on the table so to speak.</p>
<p>They seem very receptive to allowing the community to drive something like this which is great, and someone else mentioned this is being done already by other members but if it’s for a certain style of music then I’m sure Fredrik and Henrik wouldn’t mind another label or whatever popping up.</p>

            <p>Ya i think that that would be cool. But then that might lead people away, because they are an official, and not just locally owned. Many people then will think that they wouldn’t prob get featured bc Auxy would be a label. Leading people away.</p>

            <p>Go for it, I don’t want to discourage you.<br>
My comment was just because there’s been several ongoing discussions since about July 2017 about labels, promotion channels, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/search?q=label" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://disco.auxy.co/search?q=label</a><br>
<a href="https://disco.auxy.co/search?q=promotion%20channels" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://disco.auxy.co/search?q=promotion%20channels</a></p>
<p>No offense if you hadn’t been around for them, Great minds I guess. This just tends to go around and around.</p>
<p>At some point in the discussion people suggest that you go for it, but that the devs are in the business of making a great app. The community generally wants the devs to focus on making Auxy even better (and financially sustainable). Devs have said curating/distributing/promoting music is not their core business.</p>

            <p>But will there even be reposts…? Depending on how the Auxy team would run it they might only release - no reposts.</p>
<p>Also if you have good ideas for a label/collective, you could attempt to start your own.</p>

<p>This is a good idea because it gives people an opportunity to get noticed.</p>

</aside>
<p>(A) <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> and the Auxy team want to further promote Auxy, but not take revenue off of other people’s music.<br>
(B) I could be wrong, but I think the fact of an Auxy owned-and-ran record label would ruin the fun of making music with Auxy…<br>
© (agh charcters lmao) and it would decrease the amount in general and amount of support for Auxy reposts</p>
