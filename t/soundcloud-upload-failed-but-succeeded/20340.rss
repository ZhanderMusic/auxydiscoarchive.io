    <title>Soundcloud upload &quot;failed&quot; but succeeded?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/soundcloud-upload-failed-but-succeeded/20340</link>
    <description>Hello. 
Lat night I tried to upload a track from Auxy to Soundcloud and the upload failed. 
I tried 4 times and I got an error every time. 
Today I found that the track was uploaded 4 times to Soundcloud ðŸ¥´

Anyone has experienced the same?</description>

            <p>Lmao yes. The first time I did that was when I was too lazy to click to SoundCloud, so I just signed in with Auxy. It always said fail, but when I came to check there were multiple tracks of the same song. I just cleared them out and left one remaining. I see itâ€™s still a bug since now.</p>

            <p>Yeah this has happened to me too. Iâ€™ve emailed to ask about it and apparently itâ€™s a bug from SoundCloudâ€™s side. I donâ€™t think they can do anything about it.</p>
