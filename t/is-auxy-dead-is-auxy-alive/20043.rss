    <description>A topic for thinking about what the team dev is doing ? Auxy Pro for MacOs or something else ? What&#39;s your feelings ?
I&#39;m a bit scared about the end of Auxy :/</description>

            <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I think that now it’s quite clear. No major update in the futur. We can only hope for the add of some new packs I guess.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who participated to this topic, specially the team of Auxy for their time and their answers. Auxy is still a great tool for beginner who want learn the essential of music making.</p>
<p>To my pov, Auxy is the best music making app on the App Store, even if it miss a bunch of features.<br>
Thank you Auxy to created a big community of young producers, you made born inside a lot of heart the passion of music.</p>

<p>And you will be very happy to hear that yes, you can upload your projects to iCloud and they will appear across both (any) devices tied to your iCloud account.</p>
<p>The usage is a little wonky sometimes, I remember when it first was introduced it didn’t work very well but in my last testing of it a couple months ago it seemed A LOT more stable. You just have to careful where you place samples (they have to, have to, have to go in the User Samples folder under iCloud Drive &gt; KORG Gadget</p>

<p>Anything built in to the app itself is totally fine otherwise, no worries on samples. Mostly just the stuff you want to use in Bilbao and Abu Dhabi since they do not pack the sample into the gdproj2 file. (Ie, anything you import into either Zurich, Rosario or Durban will be packed into the project file itself).</p>

            <p>Thanks for this, bud. I appreciate it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m hard pressed to find a better all in one “groove box” style app that sounds this good.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s my main issue. Imo! Auxy is sonically exhausted.<br>
Maybe it’s an issue bc of the music I (mainly) make, which is not exclusively or entirely ’electronic’. So, I encounter a lack of performance and nuance control.</p>
<p>That said, even on the overtly electronic touches, it’s still hugely lacking.<br>
In a current Auxy WIP, I have a complex arpeggio pattern. I’m using a sound that has Shape (as Decay). Sweeping the arp through decay automation sounds great, and helps provide real composition texture and movement. It’s an extremely common production technique within the electronic and dance genres.</p>
<p>It blows my mind that Shape/Decay is available only on a very limited number of instruments in Auxy.</p>
<p>For an app which the makers say is optimised around creating electronic tracks, prioritising common electronic music production techniques, it’s little short of ignorant limit Decay to so few instruments.</p>
<p>As for sound quality…</p>
<p>Having spent some time in Gadget 2, gotta say, the quality of the sounds felt on a different level to Auxy. Far superior. (And, of course, there’s all the sound design controls you’d expect.)</p>
<p>(The Dublin instrument has some fantastically filthy retro basses that I really want to make use of. All high-quality stuff.)</p>
<p>Of course, access to note-level volume and velocity makes a huge difference too, but again, that’s likely less of an issue for those making straight-down-the-line ‘electronic’ music.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I might be talking myself into using Gadget 2, or at least giving it enough of a try to see if I can vibe with their construction approach.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to take a look at their midi import options, to see if bumping from Auxy to Gadget 2 might be a usable workflow once a piece is at a certain stage.</p>
<p>It’s the rigmarole of bouncing it to Ableton (laptop) that prevents me doing it more often. If bouncing to Gadget 2 is doable, albeit via a workaround, it might still allow me the ‘grab the iPad and do some more work on a track’ when I’m commuting, chilling out at a coffee bar, or just lounging on the couch at home.</p>
<p>G2 is available for both iPhone and iPad, so if they’ve got automatic syncing, so I can pick up where I left off on either device, that’s a strong plus. (Of course, this used to be supported on Auxy, but they removed it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/exploding_head.png?v=12" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji" alt=":exploding_head:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok so, a bit of a brain dump instead.</p>
<p>I hope this isn’t super disjointed, I’m a little inebriated so I’m gonna try my best.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/y7zTDxIEuMU32MKKRzJ1a5tODqR.jpeg?dl=1" title="image"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd_2_666x500.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="y7zTDxIEuMU32MKKRzJ1a5tODqR" width="666" height="500" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd_2_666x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd_2_999x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd_2_1332x1000.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/e/f/ef253cea7ef76fccacbe08b0b0788ddacaf29ebd_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Ok so, per lane, you can specify how many times a specific loop will play. There’s not a larger size than 16 bars, which is kind of standard fare. You can specify how many times a loop from an instrument will play, and then others that fit inside that will just continue to play UNLESS they are set to one shot. If it’s set to one shot it will play once, however long it’s set for, and then that’s it.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/4t6BssIpPot4aYKF55Lxs94bDFT.jpeg?dl=1" title="image"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09_2_666x500.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4t6BssIpPot4aYKF55Lxs94bDFT" width="666" height="500" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09_2_666x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09_2_999x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09_2_1332x1000.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/1/f/1f52fd1f45274260338a538faa4dfe18c2b91f09_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>At the end of the day though, an ENTIRE line will play. That’s just what it does. So if you want variations you either need to build them into a bar length, or, you duplicate and pop it into the next lane down. It is what it is.</p>
<p>Now, on the flip side, GarageBand actually has “live loops”. It looks like this:</p>

<p>This actually DOES let you select independent clips per instrument and you can kind of mix and match across the board. Those selections I made when I recorded the track look like this:</p>

<p>IMO, this is very much like Live. You select loops, you can hit record <em>on the track</em> and whether it’s a loop of audio or midi it will record to the main timeline.</p>
<p>Honestly, myself, I don’t do this. I think VERY linearly when I’m working, so I chunk stuff into clips from left to right rather than clips in a grid. But, for what it’s worth, this might jive with your workflow of actual clips that are independent of the timeline. You pick what you want and it <em>records to</em> the timeline.</p>
<p>If you’re using Live though, honestly, Auxy is probably the way to go. There’s a few things that do dump to Live (iKaossilator I think, TriqTraq) - but there’s not a ton out there that does.</p>
<p>Neither Gadget NOR GarageBand split automation from the note midi. Everything is baked into a single clip for better or worse. Nanostudio actually CAN split automation out from note midi, if you choose, but at the end of the day it is not a clip based paradigm.</p>
<p>The only other iOS/iPadOS DAW that I’m aware of that can do this is Cubasis, on paper it’s pretty damn good, but I just can’t get on with it. It does proper bussing, automation, the whole nine yards, but to me, it feels like a desktop DAW that got crammed into a touchscreen and it’s just not fluid. (Or as fluid).</p>
<p>I guess that’s all I got really. I hope this helps some.</p>
<p>I do think Auxy is a pretty good tool, I don’t know that I vibe with the cost / vs features. I think it’s VERY capable of coming up with stuff that’s near final ready, in my own experience I do feel like I need a little extra oomph at the end of the chain but I’m not an expert with this stuff. I think for what it does it does really well and really fast, I’m hard pressed to find a better all in one “groove box” style app that sounds this good.</p>
<p>I’m also worried about the future of it. I don’t know it needs <em>more</em>, unless we’re talking about time stretch and re-key. I think the whole sample pack thing has really been beat to death, unless there’s some tricks we’re not aware of.</p>
<p>This has even gone on too long lol. So I’m gonna wrap it up. But this is my hot take. Hopefully it makes sense for you and other folks.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert, I’m not a guru, but I’ve been producing exclusively on iOS since 2010 so I feel like maybe I know a thing or two about the platform and what’s going on? But anyway, take with a pinch of salt as you see fit.</p>

            <p>I’ve mentioned a couple of times that I’d like them to sell Auxy to a company (such as Splice or Novation) who are better positioned and engaged enough to maximise Auxy’s creative and business potential.</p>
<p>(Obviously, those companies would need to be interested in the first place, but) it does make me wonder what the asking price would be, if that ever became a realistic scenario.</p>
<p>(I also wonder how things could potentially work if it was sold to the community and managed and developed as a DAO. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=12" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> )</p>

<p>So, it’s not possible to speculatively create patterns, to mess about, and potentially have instruments patterns that aren’t used. i.e. patterns only exist in the context of the planned composition, not independently of it?</p>
<p>If this the case with Gadget 2, then it’s a deal-breaker.<br>
I could probably live with the other negatives bc of the many positives (compared to Auxy), but this would mean sacrificing something fundamental to the way that I create music.<br>
Seems Gadget 2 requires you to be extremely methodical, systematic and procedural, building tracks step by step, with no easy means to store pattern ideas for later (outside of the constructed track).</p>
<p>…and that ain’t me.</p>
<p>No equivalent to ‘unused patterns’ in Gadget 2?<br>

<p>I’ll take a look at NanoStudio 2 to see if that combo smooths over the deal-breaker issue above.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>So, it’s possible, probably likely, that I just spent the same as an Auxy annual subscription to properly check out an app that I possibly won’t be using going forward. The money, I don’t mind. What frustrates me is that it goes some way to showing that ppl <em>will</em> spend money on the right tools — and yet Auxy don’t seem to want to tap into that segment of the audience or do anything to increase Auxy’s appeal to that audience. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_facepalming.png?v=12" title=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":man_facepalming:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s pretty much my go to for production on iPad, and believe it or not, GarageBand too. Everyone slags on GarageBand but I don’t know why, I think it’s because they just assume you jam a bunch of live loops on a track and call it a day. You <em>can</em> do that, but it also handles recording real instruments admirably, it hosts AUs and the built in touch instruments sound REALLY good (especially in a mix).</p>
<p>Gadget is the CLOSEST you will get to a stand-alone iOS version of Reason (sorry Reason Compact). You can automate any knob. You can record audio. You can dial in your own sounds across a multitude of different instruments.</p>
<p>Now for the bad.</p>
<p>The sequencer, like you noted, takes a bit of work to get used to. It’s not even like Live, clip based yes but you can’t mix and match clips from different lanes. Lane 1 will play through, and then Lane 2, moving down down down. Personally, I hate it. I had to just bend to its will to get anything done and once I accepted it for what it was I got stuff done.</p>
<p>I would NOT use Gadget for handling recorded audio, unless you’re importing pre-cut loops. It’s a total nightmare. You can only see 16 bars of a sample, but for stuff like vocals spanning 16+ bars you either need to chop em up or, you can load a long sample, but you will have no control or visibility over it past 16 bars lol.</p>
<p>There is a mixer but oh my god, it leaves a lot to be desired imo. It’s very sub menu-ey, not all instrument effects are applicable across different gadgets or as insert effects (which is REALLY annoying).</p>
<p>It’s a unique offering. It’s got to be a loss leader because all new updates have been in the form of rompler packs for their Fairbanks instrument, which is fine I guess that’s how the market is.</p>
<p>I suspect it’s a way to get people in the door cheap and hooked on the KORG sound, then get them to buy a synthesizer. And I mean whatever that’s a valid strategy.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s my hot take I guess. Tl;dr there’s A LOT of tweakability under the hood, but the weird mix bus and sequencer does take a bit of getting used to. You can of course drive it with other stuff (I hooked up Nanostudio 2 to it at one point, works fine) - but then you’re juggling two apps and it’s annoying as hell.</p>

            <p>Would you recommend it?<br>
I downloaded the LE and gave it a little spin. I also dipped into some deep dives and creator sessions and it looks pretty powerful.</p>
<p>Obvs, the UI is more towards the full DAW experience than something stripped down (but still powerful). I’m def in the mood to try something new and go up a level or three from Auxy, while still able to enjoy the immediacy of mobile/tablet.</p>
<p>The construction workflow/model is quite different to Auxy, so would take some getting used to. It’s closer to Ableton’s Clips mode, and I never warmed to that, preferring the left-to-right timeline model.</p>
<p>Access to drum pads and keyboards, big plus.</p>
<p>I suspect much will come down to the quality and range of sounds available, though obviously, having control of sound parameters, including ADSR, already makes it a much more suitable option for anyone half-way serious about creating credible music.</p>
<p>The piano ranges are already a substantial improvement over what Auxy offers.<br>
Same for epiano.</p>
<p>Note-specific volume and velocity, huge.</p>
<p>The ability to import samples, especially for creating custom drum kits, will also influence my decision.</p>
<p>And, of course, midi in and out… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/champagne.png?v=12" title=":champagne:" class="emoji" alt=":champagne:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>By the way, this WHOLE paradigm is basically what KORG has been doing with Gadget lately. There’s been no new Gadgets, all new sounds come in the form of Fairbanks addons, it’s this crazy FM/rompler I don’t know what the F, and every couple of months they pump out a new Fairbanks module for ten bucks.</p>
<p>Easy cash. I’ve even bought two and I never buy stuff like that…</p>

            <p>From a business perspective, free demo users only matter in so far as they are potential future paying subscribers (and/or product evangelists — i.e. free advertising).</p>
<p>As horrible as it might sound, I think that Lenberg has already spent more time than he ever should have trying to make Auxy appeal to the ‘young / no income’ end of the market, and sacrificed the attention he should have been paying to music makers more willing and capable to spend money on good tools.</p>
<p>I actually believe that failing to recognise where Auxy’s best market potential is has likely crippled Auxy’s true potential.</p>

</aside>
<p>Access to the synth engine never needed it to be an internal Auxy feature.</p>
<p>If the engine is open source, then the only thing Auxy needed to do was make it possible to import user-created instruments/sound packs into Auxy, but… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/person_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Serious users would suffer with an ugly synth UI if it meant we could create and import our own Auxy instruments/sound packs.</p>
<p>Auxy team could choose to use their UX/UI skills to improve the engine UI’s usability and make it more appealing to users — with the target beneficiaries being Auxy users, and in turn Auxy.</p>
<p>As a subscriber-only feature, instrument/sound pack ‘Import’ could potentially be a game-changing enticement to sub, from a business and profitability perspective.</p>
<p>Heck, Subscribers would likely tolerate a 20–40% price increase.</p>
<p>This could potentially mean that Auxy no longer ‘needs’ to create packs (to maintain the impression that Auxy isn’t abandoned), but they could offer custom premium sound-packs directly from the Auxy site, setting their own price.</p>
<p>Same, or likely increased subscriptions revenue (bc of the new feature) + additional revenue from direct sales of ad-hoc, co-branded premium sound packs.</p>
<p>These features would likely foster a small internal marketplace which would keep users sufficiently topped-up with new packs that they wouldn’t need Auxy to release any.</p>
<p>Imo, this could be a very low risk strategy for Lenberg to…</p>
<ul>
<li>revive Auxy: re-enthuse the existing user base</li>
<li>revive Auxy: establish Auxy as a living platform for potential new users (not a zombie app)</li>
<li>improve production capabilities of the app</li>
<li>improve chances of achieving original mission statement (“<a href="https://auxy.co/#appstore" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Auxy’s mission is to put a studio in everyone’s pocket and push music forward as an artform.</a>”)</li>
<li>increase long-term profitability</li>
<li>improve revenue sustainability</li>
<li>require low/no maintenance after that first round of updates</li>
</ul>

            <p>There’s two things I would have liked to have seen.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Re-key for samples. Blocs wave does this really really well. If a sample is imported and it’s in the key of C, if I switch to D the sample should re-key. Medly does this. GarageBand does this for loops and recorded audio. I get we’re not dealing with proper audio tracks here, but this would make Auxy a remix machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A REALLY simplified version of the synth engine with some exposed parameters. Maybe two oscillators, a filter, an emp envelope, let it feed into the reverb and delay sends. Sometimes you just want a really simple sine wave.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On point 2, I could see this getting out of hand and feature creep. So it’s not really what I’d consider like, essential. The sample re-key though, this is a no brainer.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have balked at proper time stretching for the sampler either.</p>
<p>But anywho.</p>

            <p>TBH I think Auxy has reached its peak and can’t be updated anymore.</p>
<p>Take that as a grain of salt because it’s from a demo user. It’s not a request, it’s an order.</p>
