    <title>Beginning to sell beats!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/beginning-to-sell-beats/16877</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve been paying attention to my SoundCloud recently(please do), you may notice that I&#39;ve started uploading a lot of hip-hop/rap beats recently. And the good news, is that if you&#39;re looking for beats, you can buy them from me!
I&#39;ve launched a store on Beatstars.com where you can buy my beats from! If you&#39;re a producer who does hip-hop stuff I&#39;d recommend getting onto this website because it&#39;s a good way to build up a portfolio, even if you&#39;re not selling a ton. But if you do sell a ton, great! Vocalists, there&#39;s a lot of good stuff there(like mine!) that you should check out!

            <p>I’ve thought about doing this because it can make more money than just uploading. I’m still working on some hip-hop beats but once I have more, maybe I will</p>
