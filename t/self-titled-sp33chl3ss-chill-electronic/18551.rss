I think this track has the most potential reach out of any I&#39;ve made. I tried very hard to be patient and keep the sound-space clear and decluttered. In other words, I went at it with much more intentional, deliberate instrument placement, and tried to give each of them their own space to shine.

Any listens/critiques are much appreciated.</description>
