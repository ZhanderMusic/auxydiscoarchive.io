            <p>Thanks so much for the feedback! I thought no one was going to give me any feedback.</p>
<p>I dont know how tp change the url <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Yes i think that the chords sounds random too<br>
If you could give me any advice on making harmonic and competible chords that would be amazing(since your chord progressions are amazing on your songs You know how to make chord progressions)</p>
<p>Yes i took out that weird bass from the song for spotify release.</p>
<p>Other than that if you have extra tips that would be cool too <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback again <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:">.</p>

            <p>Feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change your SoundCloud URL to something else than <code>user-2087239874</code> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actual feedback:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This may be just me, but having ducker without a kick sounds kinda weird</li>
<li>Chords sound a little bit random (also could be just me)</li>
<li>Mix is a little muddy with the bass</li>
<li>Nice percussion, fits the tropical feel <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, nice job. The issue for me was just the chords and the muddiness of the mix which made it kinda hard to listen to. Other than that, it sounds cool!</p>
