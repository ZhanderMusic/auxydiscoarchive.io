    <title>Does anyone know anything about Bandcamp?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/does-anyone-know-anything-about-bandcamp/7901</link>
    <description>So I’m debating on wether or not I should get a bandcamp account. Does anyone know if I should or not and what some of the guidelines are/how they handle people who break them?

I know for sure that they don’t allow covers of songs and that kind of makes me sad since I love to make covers of songs. All of my music would be free to download since I make music for fun, not profit.

Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>I have a bandcamp… and people actually buy my music on there! Occasionally. In fact I used BandCamp before I got a SoundCloud about a month later.</p>
<p>It’s also great if you want to use it to give away your music for free. You can set it so that instead of paying money to download the track, you ask for an email address to add to your mailing list. It even has an automatic system; say a dude puts in his email for a free download. Now, every time I upload music to Bandcamp, that dude gets an email from Bandcamp telling him about it. The catch is, people can stream the full song from your page as many times as they want without being forced to download, whether you set it to be paid or free. It’s part of their philosophy.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is cool, and I think it’s a good supplement to SoundCloud. One of the BIG differences is that SoundCloud downloads only in the format you upload it in, while Bandcamp takes you .wav file and converts it into literally every format there is. So, when someone goes to download a song, they have a choice of every format (even the high quality ones) which is different from SC, where if you upload .mp3 people can only download .mp3.</p>
<p>Also, BandCamp is helpful for me when I’m using more than one device. Ex. I upload music to Bandcamp on one device, the go to the other and download it on that device to use.</p>
<p>On top of that, BandCamp has no limit on tracks, so you will never run out of time.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen the memes, you know the people who browse BandCamp and SoundCloud are different. SC is geared towards rap and bands and stuff, while BandCamp is a little more classy.</p>
<p>One last thing; having a BandCamp is a great substitute for having a personal website. Your BandCamp Page is very customizable (more so than SC), with every color, add your own images, everything. It’s really great.</p>
<p>I’ve never broken one of their guidelines so I’m not sure how that works.</p>
<p>Hooo boy I typed a lot. Gold Medal?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - BandCamp is an awesome way to let people download your music, whether you put it up for free or for an email address, and it should be used to supplement your SC page.</strong></p>

            <p>Eh, I’m only 16 and don’t have a paypal or anything yet so I’m not quite ready to make money off of my music yet. Maybe I shoulda worded that better. XD</p>
<p>But yeah, I think just keeping my stuff on my soundcloud would be best. Only thing is, I can’t get the pro thing, so I have to delete some of my tracks once I reach the limit. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Then, <em>imo</em>, there’s really no benefit to adding it to Bandcamp beyond what you already get from SC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(…though, why can’t it be for both fun <em>and</em> profit? Isn’t that the ideal?)</p>
