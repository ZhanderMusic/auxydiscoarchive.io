    <title>Dadmother - 3 AM (chill WIP)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dadmother-3-am-chill-wip/15538</link>
    <description>Just started working on this. Chill with a lot of ambience, and overall very relaxing to make thus far! This is in no way near a finished product and serves to display the musical and structural ideas for the track as of now. Feedback is welcome!

            <p>sine is very thin (the old tv sound bleep/emergency broadcast sound), saw is very buzzy, and square is bright and video-game-y</p>

            <p>Thanks, bud! I appreciate them dang ol’ kind words. I’ll admit, I’m pretty ignorant to lead shape jargon (square, triangle, sawtooth etc.), but I plan on educating myself on the subject <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=9" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"> I understand the shapes themselves as waveforms, but I guess I’ve never thought about how they SOUND.</p>

            <p>Nice, diggin the vibe so far, very laid back. Would like to hear maybe a filtered square lead over the top? Nice guitars toward the end!</p>
