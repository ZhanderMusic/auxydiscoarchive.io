    <title>Opinion on reviving dead threads?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/opinion-on-reviving-dead-threads/14657</link>
    <description>I think that if the thread seems to be useful and it will benefit the community, it should revived. However, if the thread hasn’t been replied into in a while, should it brought back up or just left alone?

Ex: [The Genre_Overview thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/genres-overview/8067)</description>

            <p>Agreed. If a thread is still relevant it’s not closed. If the thread is super off topic or gets off topic then it gets closed. Age is kind of not relevant in closure…</p>
