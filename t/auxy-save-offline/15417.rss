    <title>Auxy save offline?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-save-offline/15417</link>
    <description>I had an Auxy project I had made on the 04/08/2019, but after searching for it for an hour I havenâ€™t found it. I clicked through every single project on iCloud files and Auxy, but it wasnâ€™t in either places. I was working offline. Is there a way I could have somehow not saved it? Or is it more possible that I accidentally deleted it?</description>

            <p>I think itâ€™s gone.  From what i believe, Auxyâ€™s backup directory is tied to the icloud one, so if your project is deleted and you were offline, no backup file in icloud/auxy was created.</p>
