    <title>New future bass track “Drop of Water” out now!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-future-bass-track-drop-of-water-out-now/21246</link>
    <description>Here’s a future bass track I started a few months ago that I thought had some potential so I spent a couple days fixing it up and finishing it.

Here’s the track: https://soundcloud.com/colin-m-348193009/time-a-drop-of-water

It’s got some pretty basic chords but I tried to make the drop sound unique to other future bass songs, anyway, hope you enjoy!</description>
