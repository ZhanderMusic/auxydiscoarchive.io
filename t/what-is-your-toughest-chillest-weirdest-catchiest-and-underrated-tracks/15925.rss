            <p>Toughest: I don’t make heavy music either, I did make an EDM song (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/in-color" rel="nofollow noopener">in color</a>) though</p>
<p>Chillest: All of them, especially <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/lost" rel="nofollow noopener">lost</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/ride" rel="nofollow noopener">ride</a></p>
<p>Weirdest: I don’t usually experiment with music styles that much (maybe I should do that more) but <a href="https://soundlcoud.com/crystldawn/mist" rel="nofollow noopener">mist</a> was kind of weird</p>
<p>Catchiest: Definitely <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/austumn" rel="nofollow noopener">autumn</a>. It didn’t get a huge amount of plays or likes but I find myself humming it all the time.</p>
<p>Most underrated: Probably <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/surf" rel="nofollow noopener">surf</a>.</p>

            <p>Heaviest: skipping this one, I don’t make any heavy music. (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/stereofld/fade" rel="nofollow noopener">Fade</a> has the hardest bass drop though)<br>

            <p>A bit late to the party, but why not.</p>
<p>Toughest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honestly I actually have like a full LP’s worth of harder hitting tracks ive never released, but in terms of released stuff, this is it, My heaviest Auxy track: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/m_x_c_n/untitled" rel="nofollow noopener">Untitled</a>.  It’s super short and one of my first auxy tracks i posted that wasn’t a BTC.  It’s not super impressive in terms of quality, but i just threw the fattest basses on there that i could with the old original sounds and i still think it somewhat holds up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chillest:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do have a few that i deep worthy of a “chill” title, but the one i think is the best would be my winter tourney entry <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/holiday" rel="nofollow noopener">Holiday</a>.  The challenge was to make a melody that revolved around a winter memory or something like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weirdest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands down <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/nuke-it" rel="nofollow noopener">Nuke It</a>.  I dont know when i got this or if i got the project from someone, but while clearing out old tracks i came across that one and just thought it was some weird af stuff.  It’s not really a full track, more of a beat, but still.  weird</li>
</ul>
<p>Catchiest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although i literally have a track where i tried to channel Alan Walker to make, i dont think it’s my catchiest track.  That one goes to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/the-comet" rel="nofollow noopener">The Comet</a>.  Something about that baseline that when i got all the tracks together just stuck in my head for a while and i kept replaying it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most underrated:</p>
<ul>
<li>For this one though i do have a good number of tracks with very few plays, i’m only going to mention it if i think it’s quality.  From just numbers, it’s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/bittersweet" rel="nofollow noopener">Bittersweet</a> with only 23 plays and it’s been out for over a year now.  No likes either oof.  I originally thought that it sounded ice cold and thought it’d do much better than it has.  <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-is-your-toughest-chillest-weirdest-catchiest-and-underrated-tracks/15925/40">spoiler</a></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honorable mentions: (lot of these bare with me here)</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/auxy-tournament-week-02" rel="nofollow noopener">auxy tourney entry</a> that i still feel is pretty fire even if it’s just the drop</li>
<li>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/psychedelic" rel="nofollow noopener">Psychedelic</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-22" rel="nofollow noopener">Loneliness</a> are 2 tracks that are on the chill side, but are also tracks that are lowkey underrated to me just by the amount of interaction on them.</li>
<li>While not super high quality, I think this is one of the first <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/auxy-tournament-3-week-3" rel="nofollow noopener">Moombah track</a> i’ve seen in Auxy or at least one of the few left since IVO/XAVIOR deleted most of his older stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>apologize if it seems like im just trying to plug myself in here hella much, but i tried to explain all my track choices, even if there were quite a few of them</p>

<p>Underrated? I’m pretty sure based on my number of followers, underrated isn’t an issue for me. But I think this track was pretty groovy.<br>

<strong>weirdest:</strong> i’d have to go with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thatguywhousesauxy/caves" rel="nofollow noopener">Caves</a> idk it’s just kinda unusual for my style of music<br>
<strong>catchiest:</strong> literally everyone says <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thatguywhousesauxy/low" rel="nofollow noopener">low</a> is super catchy or something and i just don’t get it??? i literally put like 0.2 seconds of effort into it but ok, i mean i ain’t complaning tho<br>
<strong>underrated:</strong> bruh i was really proud of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thatguywhousesauxy/starlight" rel="nofollow noopener">Starlight</a> cause of my xtreme drum sampling skills but it never really got super popular</p>

            <p>Toughest:<br>
Atmosfear — It was first attempt at trying to make a thrilling theme. I think it turned out okay.<br>
Chillest:<br>
Vintage Keys Edit — It’s basically an extended version of the vintage keys demo.<br>
Weirdest:<br>
Psycho — It’s the first song where I used 48th notes. I also had some polyrhythm changes. I “distorted” almost all the instruments I used so it’s very hectic.<br>
Catchiest:<br>
Night Club Showdown — It just has a really rhythmic bass and the chorus is really simple, but does the trick! Probably the song I’m most proud of and it’s also the song that has the most likes!<br>
Underrated:<br>
Melancholy Mix — I’m a fan of tango and I mixed it with a trap beat as a joke, but it turned out sounding really good so I decided to make the whole beat a trap beat.</p>

            <p>To prevent this from becoming a self promo dump thread, why don’t people explain their choices more.</p>
<p>I’ll explain a bit more about my previous choices.</p>
<p>Toughest: I chose two non-Auxy songs for this category. The first one, motion, is a self released track that I posted a few months ago. The track is definitely a top choice because the drop is pretty unexpected and hits hard. The other choice, variable, is my first non-Auxy song that had an official release. It was released with Tesseract Records earlier in the year. I chose this one because the punchy drums along with the gritty bass and lead patterns make the drop very hard hitting.</p>
<p>Chillest: I chose my track hologram, which I released with Ridgeline back when I was using Auxy as my primary DAW. I still hadn’t found my niche yet and this track reflects some experimentation with the chill genre. I would have picked purple magic for this one but I personally like hologram more.</p>
<p>Weirdest: If you haven’t heard my music, I make some pretty weird and experimental stuff. Most of the stuff on my main SoundCloud page after February is really weird since I became more interested in the experimental bass genre at that time.</p>
<p>Catchiest: I chose Insomnia, my first label release with Auxy (and in general). The song was released with Frontier last August. You may notice that the track is very different from my current stuff. At that time, I was making more melodic EDM stuff, but I still used some experimentation in the track. The song is so catchy because I spent a long time perfecting the main melody until it was perfect.</p>
<p>Most underrated: My track monsoon season was released about a month ago as the debut single for an album I’m working on. The track is currently sitting just below 300 plays, which is one of the lowest tracks on my page. I was pretty proud of this track so I’m hoping the track will get more exposure once the full album is released.</p>

            <p>Here’s mine! I’m gonna put a few non-Auxy as well because I’m proud of my non-Auxy music more than my Auxy music lately.</p>
<p>Toughest:<br>
Auxy: I gotta go back to my old Auxy alias for this. My remix of Wave by Austin Haga was honestly one of the best Auxy songs I’ve done. I’ve been working on new music on that account too and posting new Auxy stuff there because it doesn’t fit the theme of my “surf” account.<br>

Ableton: Definitely this one.<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/yaboiizaiah/phantom-w-sei" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/yaboiizaiah/phantom-w-sei</a></p>
<p>Chillest:<br>
Auxy: Definitely my recent song HANG.<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/surfmusicinc/hang" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/surfmusicinc/hang</a><br>
Ableton: This one’s a no brainer. I have to go with my song Midnight Conversations. It’s my biggest song to date and I’m extremely proud of it.<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/seikatsuuu/midnight-conversations" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/seikatsuuu/midnight-conversations</a></p>
<p>Weirdest:<br>
Auxy: I don’t make much weird stuff yet. But this is my weirdest song by far.<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/surfmusicinc/fourtwenty-w-fuujiya-toveii" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/surfmusicinc/fourtwenty-w-fuujiya-toveii</a></p>
<p>Catchiest: All of the above😂</p>
<p>Most Underrated:<br>
Auxy: My “vectr” account is dead right now so run it up.<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/vectr-music/abandon" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/vectr-music/abandon</a><br>
Ableton: My new song Can’t Get Away isn’t doing as well as my older stuff, go run up those stats ASAP.<br>

<p>Hope you guys like my songs! Thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dj_la_rocca">@DJ_La_Rocca</a> for making this thread because it’s a great idea!</p>
