    <title>Stung Drums Challenge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/stung-drums-challenge/3705</link>
    <description>_Ahhhhh! There’s a swarm of bees! They are stinging your drums! What are you gonna do? You need to make a song quick, but all of your drums are too lumpy of bee stings to drum. (And it would hurt them if you tried!)_

For this challenge you need to make a song of any length, without drums.

RULES AND GUIDELINES:
- You can not use drums for anything.
- You can not manipulate sounds to work as drums (for example, automating Punch to sound like a kick).
- You can submit with a soundcloud link OR a project link (either works, but I would suggest soundcloud to prevent plagiarism).
- The song can be any length, but it should still consist of all song parts.
- Submissions end on the 23rd of November.
- PM me if you have questions, or would like an extra day or 2 on the challenge.
- Most likes wins. But if likes are scarce then I will manually choose.
- Winner will be announced on the 30th of November.

Remember to have fun!
