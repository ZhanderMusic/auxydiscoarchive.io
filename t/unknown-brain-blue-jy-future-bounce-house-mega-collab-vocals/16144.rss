    <title>Unknown Brain - Blue-Jy [Future bounce/house, mega collab? vocals?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/unknown-brain-blue-jy-future-bounce-house-mega-collab-vocals/16144</link>
    <description>Recently I have started getting back into the genre that really suits me so I thought I’d do a collab to begin my future bounce days :blush:
                                   — 
So I kind of want to make a track like this cause it’s so hype

            <p>(I don’t want this to be used for the collab I want to finish it on my own but…) is this style of drop kind of like the kinda style we wanna go for? Or is it too heavy <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blue-jy">@Blue-Jy</a></p>

<p>Not that we use this drop again, but just the style cuz I can make that pretty well</p>
