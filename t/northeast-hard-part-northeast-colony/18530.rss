I made Hard Part right after I posted Colony. Some of the features of both songs (more specifically, the drop) called for attention the first go around. For Colony, I asked for help on here, and received it from user @XLXK. For Hard Part, I asked on the Auxy Community Discord, and received help from user @Stigmo. I thank them so very much for their help, and I’m hoping to maybe get caught in making a song with them later on.</description>

            <p>I loved Colony. What did you use for the last riser towards the end? Was it a lead, pad, or an actual riser?</p>
