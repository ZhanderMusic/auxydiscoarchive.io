    <title>Post your great Auxy feature idea here!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/post-your-great-auxy-feature-idea-here/1129</link>
    <description>So, Auxy is great and all, but I&#39;m sure a ton of you guys actually have some pretty impressive ideas for Auxy, and not just AP ideas!

Here are some of mine:

An undo feature- It&#39;s explained here: https://disco.auxy.co/t/missing-an-undo-feature/925/18
_______
A loop &quot;fuser&quot;- There&#39;s a time where you have two loops, and you feel like you should fuse them together cause they sound great. So, maybe when you&#39;re in the &quot;Moving&quot; menu, you double tap your loop and you get a message on top saying &quot;Select a loop to combine your instrument loop with.&quot; Then you drag the loop you tapped twice on to the loop you want to fuse it with (but only with the same instrument, but it could work with other Melodic/Drum loops too). Because of the 8 bar loop limit and you can only make 1, 2, 4 and 8 bar loops, you can only combine those loops with these kinds of combinations:
1 bar x 8
2 bar x 4
4 bar x 2

_________
A universal clipboard- You know how you can copy and paste your instruments and paste a loop sequence in the editor? Well, I feel like the copy and paste in the loop editor isn&#39;t enough. So, what if you had a place to store all your loops and note sequences in one place? So, you can access it from any project, tap the settings, have a menu labelled as &quot;Clipboard&quot; where you can place your copied loops and notes anywhere within the project.
_____
Tempo change in Automation- Some songs you hear on SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify etc. have that small change in speed in them. I&#39;ve come up with songs in my head that actually kinda need that tempo change, and I was thinking of adding that little feature into Auxy.


What are your innovative ideas for Auxy?</description>

            <p>I wonder if my thread merging messed things up a bit. In either way, I will go through this thread and collect the most common requests. Then start a new thread where I list these request along with my comments on whether each feature is likely to happen or not. Then you’re welcome to add any new ideas to that thread. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/gift.png?v=6" title=":gift:" class="emoji" alt=":gift:"></p>

            <p>It works on everything from the iPod touch to the iPhone XS Max and all iPads. On the App Store though, somewhere with or near the app description, there is usually a list of supported devices if you want to be sure. This goes for any app not just Auxy.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be ideal. Auxy could be so much more with an EQ in this form.</p>

            <p>I feel like that’s require everyone to make specific Auxy accounts and to always have an internet connection to work tho.</p>
<p>Like how google docs n similar things work.<br>
I’d be awesome no doubt, but doesn’t seem currently viable and would probably be confusing since you’re editing music and not an essay lol</p>

            <p>Maybe an option where you can share your project like a shared word document so you and who ever you send it to could work on it in real time. This could make collabs easier.</p>

            <p>It does have EQ, the end user simply does not have access to it.</p>
<p>Auxy’s features are relatively fully fleshed out in this regard. However, it’s all behind the curtain to make things faster and simpler, less complicated. Adding in this feature for users would be smart, but it introduces complexity, and that’s not what the devs want.</p>

            <p>I’d be fine for one-sample melodic imports, as that is the standard usage case. As for supporting multiple samples, you could always use some sort of external concatenation (or even internal concatenation) in a menu of sorts that puts it on the parts. Loading up the samples in a similar way to the drum kits, it would map out the regions in an appropriate manner, making use of the amount of samples and their pitches. Of course this isn’t trivial, but it’s possibly the most intuitive user-friendly method, which is certainly a goal for Auxy.</p>

<p>Being able to transpose the key by scene would be useful for pitching the kick/snare/any sample that tunes to key because other than making room for a second sample that would be pitched to the new key</p>

            <p>Yes of course but sometimes when I use vocal samples it practically ruins the song since I can’t change the key.</p>
