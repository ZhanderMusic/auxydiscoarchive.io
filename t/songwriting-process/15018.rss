    <title>Songwriting Process?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/songwriting-process/15018</link>
    <description>whatâ€™s your song writing process? for me I typically start with the drop/chorus rather than the intro and then build from there. (i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s weird or normal haha)

...then i procrastinate for a very long time ðŸ˜‚</description>

<p>I typically build a track as if it were a painting. From start to end but sometimes Iâ€™ll start with the main part and then build on the left and right (intro and outro and other structures in between)</p>

            <p>A lot of my tracks are different. I think drum and percussion might be the most I start with. Sometimes my progress just stops and I get stuck. Iâ€™ll bring loops over from other tracks and see how they work together. Also Iâ€™ve been making my tracks long, sometimes i think too long. I have one more Iâ€™m about done with that is close to 5 minutes. I do it by just creating different parts. Iâ€™ll try and mess around a lot like itâ€™s a new song, but keeping same elements and feelings, and then mix them together.</p>
