            <p>If you’re willing to spend a little green, I highly recommend you do some searching on <a href="http://Fiverr.com">Fiverr.com</a>. That’s where I found the amazing singers for all of my tracks and I made some useful connections out of those collaborations as well. You really get the bang for your buck (if you do your research). Totally worth it!</p>

<p>Nono, I’m (lazily) on the lookout for a lyricist also. The pieces I’m working on don’t have a vocal melody written yet either.</p>
<p>I’m interested to find a lyricist and/or vocalist who can contribute their own take on that aspect too.</p>
<p>I might throw it up as a possible collaboration, though I might not do that just here.</p>

            <p>Do you already have lyrics? (Not offering, just curious.)</p>
<p>Interested to see how this turns out, as I have at least a couple of pieces that are intended to be finished as electro-pop songs/tracks. Both have neither lyrics or vocals yet.</p>
