            <p>Hello Thomas,<br>
I appreciate your story.<br>
The things that inspire me, specifically in the realm of music, are the other Auxy producers. Although at times it may seem like we are limited with what we can do in Auxy, and get stuck into making the same chords or melodies, other producers show just how diverse and universal Auxy can be. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
