An ok song; I’m coming out of my writers block after a few moths so it’s a step in the right direction for me.
Enjoy!</description>

            <p>Chill stuff bro! Like the percussion, as it fits really well. I like the horn as well. Provides for an awesome melody. Chords are beautiful. 8bit melody about halfway in is tight. I’m not sure what genre this is. Lol. Super chill stuff though.<br>
Don’t like 1:24 melody, but otherwise awesome!</p>
<p>Melody: 8/10<br>
Chords: 9/10<br>
Drums: 8/10<br>
Bassline: 7/10<br>
Appeal: 8/10</p>
<p>Overall: 40/50</p>
