            <p>I’m not trying to be rude but what’s the point of a repost account that has little to no followers? I’m just looking at this from a logical standpoint… If you can get followers who will listen then good on you but until then, I don’t know… thanks for the follow though. I guess you could start following people and hope they follow back, like I did, and then they mention you to others and the cycle continues. Just throwing a little feedback at you on this decision</p>
