    <title>ISOBEL - JL Music [Electronic]</title>

The first track on the journey into a darker state of mind, inspired by the upcoming webcomic [ISOBEL](https://isobelcomic.com/). Updates start on May 10th and will continue weekly until the end of the story. Please make sure to check out the webcomic, it&#39;s quite good. Well worth the time to read.

In this post I am also making an announcement of the current state and direction of my music. As you all can see, I&#39;ve made a second account for music, taking Akabil&#39;s suggestion of having a different account for a drastically different style. Most of my music is light and easygoing, but for my new music, I&#39;ve been craving a darker, grittier approach. A sense of doom and menace foreboding. For this, I&#39;ve created JL Music, pronounced &quot;Jay El&quot;. As a direction and branding, it will be where I produce my new music. This does not mean that E/E is going away, rather, E/E will be where I continue to produce more light music, and enjoy a lighthearted stroll through sound experimentation.

I feel this shift is what my music has really needed. I need to move past my own barriers I placed around myself going forward, and I believe this will allow me to do so. I hope those of you who like my music will be pleasantly surprised with the change of direction, and those skeptical of my music will love the new direction it&#39;s taking.
