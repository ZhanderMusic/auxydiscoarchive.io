    <description>Hey I got a random specific question, but maybe somebody can help me out. I was just wondering if anybody knew how to create this big percussion sound in Auxy, or if they could tell me what it’s called so I can look for a sample? It could just be a big sounding Tom, but maybe it has some fancy orchestral name? Thanks!

            <p>I agree. The toms in Oregon actually work pretty well for that sound, and try turning the reverb up all the way for that and an acoustic bass drum. I think you may get a similar effect.</p>
