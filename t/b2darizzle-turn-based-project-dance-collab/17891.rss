Just looking for direction or collab even. I like the fatness of the sounds, but it still sounds a little empty. It’s got a good groove, just not sure where it needs to go from here. Any help or suggestions appreciated.</description>

            <p>More or less just mixed it and changed the sounds, might try more later. <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/f7yg2dj74r-Cl0MIogTaqg==" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/f7yg2dj74r-Cl0MIogTaqg==</a></p>
