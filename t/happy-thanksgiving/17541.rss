    <description>Made this topic a few years ago and thought I’d do it again. What are you guys thankful for?

I’m thankful for music, probably. I’ve come pretty far in the past year musically, but there’s also just so much good music out there to listen too.</description>

            <p>This is a great thread! Thanks for starting it <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/crystldawnmusic">@crystldawnmusic</a>!</p>
<p>There’s a <em>whole</em> lot I’m thankful for this year. I am thankful for the school I attend now, and the opportunity I have to study music every day. I am thankful for music itself, and for the opportunities it continues to present me. I am thankful for my family and my friends, who encourage me, provide for me, and spur me on. I am thankful for my country. And of course, I am thankful for good food <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Most of all, I am thankful to God, who made it all, and who has given me new life. Hopefully you guys all find things to be thankful for as well, especially since Christmas season has now begun!</p>

            <p>Auxy is amazing it allows me to make music with little effort. I have to say, auxy has come a long way from the original version with its old green logo. It’s a professional DAW and I’m thankful for it, it’s just a great tool and app to use. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
