    <title>Use Auxy to create ringtones</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/use-auxy-to-create-ringtones/820</link>
    <description>After a few tracks I&#39;ve made on Auxy, I got bored one day...
So I decided to make a new project a place a bit of notices in a small sequence, and ended up with something that sounds like a ringtone. 
So I suddenly exported it, used a converter to change the Auxy exported .wav to a .m4r file, which is the file type for ringtones, and used that small idea out of boredom as a ringtone.
So, Auxy could be used not just for making music, but for making tones for your phone as well!</description>

            <p>That works too, actually, and I’ve done that without using GarageBand. I’ve made another ringtone on the same day I made the first one with one of the songs I made on Auxy and just duplicated the project and shortened the Auxy song and then exported it as a .wav</p>
