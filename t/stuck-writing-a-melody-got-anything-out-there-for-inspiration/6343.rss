    <title>Stuck writing a melody. Got anything out there for inspiration?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/stuck-writing-a-melody-got-anything-out-there-for-inspiration/6343</link>
    <description>For the Auxy Tournament, this round we have to write a melody but I’m really stuck! Anyone have any memorable or interesting melody-centric songs they can link me? Auxy, EDM, classical, underground, mainstream, whatever has a good melody welcomed. 

Would be greatly appreciated!</description>

<p>I singled those ones out as the ‘chill’ ones.<br>
Some of my other tracks have more driven lead melodies.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> I don’t think I’ve gone through your soundcloud before! There’s some nice stuff. I feel like stress of the time limit (1 minute) is forcing me to condense the melody I’m writing into something very fast, whereas I enjoy kinda what you make – something that takes it time.</p>

<p>Barely.<br>
Every note of those tracks went from my head straight into Auxy.</p>
<p>Actually, Sketch 22 was finished in Ableton Live, based on stems and MIDI exported from Auxy.<br>
I switched it over to Ableton for access to more sounds.</p>
<p>‘Same as it ever was’ is pure Auxy.</p>

            <p>I love Sketch 22. The chords and percussion just make it such a nice track to listen to. Same As It Ever Was is also so soothing nice to listen to. Do you play piano?</p>

            <p>I’m working on a melodious very song right now. I kinda want the whole song to be a super chill jazzy song full of random solos.<br>
Here it is.<br>

Keep in mind it’s still a WIP. This would have worked really well with the pitch bend challenge.</p>

            <p>Thanks.<br>
There are several melodies in there, but if you’re referring to the piano melody, be aware that’s from ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/OXAN-0fKse0">La Vie en Rose</a>’ (famous, much covered French song).</p>
<p>It’s the only time I’ve used/referenced a melody from someone else’s music. (I think it works pretty well.)</p>
<p>All the other melodies in that track - and all my other tracks so far - are my own.</p>

            <p>I might be able to send something, but you shouldn’t be using other people’s melodies in the competition.</p>

            <p>For the Auxy Tournament, this round we have to write a melody but I’m really stuck! Anyone have any memorable or interesting melody-centric songs they can link me? Auxy, EDM, classical, underground, mainstream, whatever has a good melody welcomed.</p>
<p>Would be greatly appreciated!</p>
