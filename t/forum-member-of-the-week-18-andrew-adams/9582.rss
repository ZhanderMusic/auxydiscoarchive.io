&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #18: @Andrew_Adams   &lt;/big&gt; 

I&#39;m quietly pleased that Andrew Adams has been randomly selected this week, as he seems like a real nice guy, who&#39;s always popping in to support others. 
 
 &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;ndrew  plays :musical_keyboard:, some guitar  &amp; :trumpet: and he sings.  He also excels at Auxy music competitions.  :trophy:

* In the Auxy Forum Awards, Andrew was shortlisted for Producer of the Year (2017). 

* He won the [2nd Auxy Tournament](https://disco.auxy.co/t/contest-second-auxy-tournament/4040?preview_theme_key=cc572199-730a-4648-9702-cdebf2a63d68) to claim a :unicorn:  and is currently co-hosting the [3rd Tournament](https://disco.auxy.co/t/contest-third-auxy-tournament/9097). 

* Andrew short-listed for [BTC 16](https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-16?in=s0phont/sets/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-16). He short-listed for [BTC 17](https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-17?in=otzsil/sets/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-17). And he totally won [BTC 23](https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-23?in=mrandersonauxy/sets/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-23). (I stopped checking BTC&#39;s at that point!!)

Andrew hosted [Beat the Clock #22](https://disco.auxy.co/t/beat-the-clock-22/4115) - challenging us to put emotion into our music, based on two pictures (Freedom and Loneliness). Remember that? 

He&#39;s been reposted by Auxy and delivered collabs with peeps like Southborne, Voltt, Morgen, Horiz3n, intrepid, blackøcean and Just !n Cayz in recent months. 

Enjoy a delicious taste of [Andrew Adams](https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/tracks ) this week.

<p>You’ve been told this many times by the Auxy community, but your keyboard skills are awesome. Tracks like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/beneath-the-sunset">Beneath The Sunset</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/starlight">Starlight</a> &amp; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/sunlight">Sunlight</a> really showcase this.</p>
<p>And you’re great at creating an epic sound, like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/journeys-end">Journey’s end</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/battlecry">Battlecry</a> &amp; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/en-fuego">En Fuego</a>.</p>
<p>My fav tracks are definitely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/journeys-end">Journey’s End</a>  - It’s so epic and uplifting.  Just  beautiful. You did an amazing job of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-23">Beat The Clock #23</a> - Melody sucks me right in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently you’ve got Logic now, but hopefully you keep making Auxy music for us too!</p>
<p>Thanks for being our Forum Member of the Week!</p>

            <p>I just have to say, I really love your tracks. They are filled with such musical melodies and the atmosphere you create in each track is amazing. I love the way how everything works together so well. You’ll only notice it when it’s gone. It all fits.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s nothing else I can really say. Melodies are on point. Intros are on point. Drops are on point. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>
<hr>
<p>BATTLECRY IS AWESOME</p>
<p>TOKYO BAY IS AWESOME</p>
<p>EN FUEGO IS EN FUEGO <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"></p>
<p>ALL YOUR TRACKS ARE <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"></p>
<hr>
<p>Another thing is that you are a really nice person, which I always like.</p>

I listened to quite a few of your tracks again, that was very enjoyable <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  You have a very distinct style; very melodic, and it’s great and always quality! You are really an expert in chord progressions and piano melodies. I’ve been wanting to make progressive house for a long time already but it hasn’t worked out yet; your soundcloud is really the place for me to analyse. My favorite tracks of yours are Soaring, Battlecry and En Fuego. Especially the drums and drum fills in Battlecry are next level, and En Fuego is so fresh with those strong drop stabs or whatever these are called lol (was this one made before the Auxy January update? Because that would make it even more impressive). I was really impressed by the atmospheric Journey’s End as well.<br>
At this point I can’t really give you any points to improve on, so please, just continue what you always do!<br>
Also, you’re one of the nicest guys on this forum, so thank you for that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Gonna have to disagree your songs are kinda some of the best made with auxy.<br>
It’s hard to tell that some of them are even auxy.<br>
Because the sounds and composition of all your songs sound really good and professional</p>

            <p>Thanks so much man! I also really appreciate the things to improve on as well. Totally see where your coming from on the white noise sweeps–I definitely can tend to overuse those.</p>
<p>Also I’m curious what you mean about a “spectrum analyser”? Do I find this on a DAW or something? It sounds cool. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Your songs are so high energy I love it! really clean production quality.<br>
Really love “soaring” Maybe lacking a little bit of high end mix but the structure is truly memorable!<br>
Really great stuff, the only negative feed back I would give is cut down on the whiye noise sweeps and try using different methods of transition, also you mix down needs some work, just try check each instrument and look on a spectrum analyser for where harmonics are lacking!<br>
Really great stuff again my guy, you deserve this <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>All of you songs have an emotion that you capture which makes them really good and unique.</p>
<p>Journeys end is one of my favorites, I really love the use of the real instruments.</p>
<p>Tokyo bay is also one of my favorites because I have been to Tokyo, and your song really reminded me of that.</p>
<p>Battle cry is also awesome, I love the inspirational chords, and how the drop has so many different sounds.</p>
