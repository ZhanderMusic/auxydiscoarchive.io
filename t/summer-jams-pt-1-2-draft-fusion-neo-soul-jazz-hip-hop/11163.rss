    <title>Summer Jams Pt 1 &amp; 2 (Draft, Fusion, Neo-Soul, Jazz, Hip-Hop)</title>

    <description>Another WIP retro Summer jam.

&#39;Part 2&#39; started as a spin-off of another of my (as-yet-uncompleted) Summer Jams.
So, I&#39;ll likely finish them as Parts 1 and 2 and bookend them on an Summer Jams EP.

Part 2 (Draft):

&amp;nbsp;
My process for these pieces is based around trialing things on a keyboard, then getting it down in Auxy.
I think the fluidity of the melodies really benefits. Really able to feel the vibe when I&#39;m creating. I feel much more connected to the music I&#39;m making – and I think it shows in the music.

Enjoy. :sun_with_face:</description>
