    <title>What is your least favorite Auxy Track you made?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-is-your-least-favorite-auxy-track-you-made/11134</link>
    <description>I just wanted to wonder if any of you guys created songs long ago or recently that you dislike. My least favorite track I created was called Steakhouse (IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE IT IS ABOUT A STEAKHOUSE.) I created Steakhouse the day “Shift” by Tatarat came in the feed (June 11, 2017)

            <p>What I think is worse about Steakhouse is that at the drop, North is the main drums, and it’s beat makes it sound more like a rush song. Even Prey’s (It’s Charge, but I set the tweaks to change the sounds) HiHat are out of sync with the beat, because all note sizes are changing on each hit.</p>

            <p>Is that the right project? The link opens a project called <code>disturbing jam</code> on my iPad, which has Disturbing Leads so it couldn’t have been made in 2017.</p>
