    <title>[WIP] 134BPM house track (Shephe)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/wip-134bpm-house-track-shephe/8733</link>
    <description>Hi peeps,

Havenâ€™t been on very much lately, with the first month of uni, as well as being heavily uninspired, especially with Auxy ðŸ˜¥

 Hereâ€™s a WIP that Iâ€™ve whipped &lt;small&gt;(haha)&lt;/small&gt; up, however, and I would be very grateful if anyone could help me out on what I should focus on within the track / add to it in terms of ideas and details / direction with song structure feedback / etc.

Cheers,
