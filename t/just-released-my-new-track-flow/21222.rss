            <p>Tbh, I preferred the chilled vibe of the stripped back intro and was expecting (hoping) it would evolve into a solid, understated minimal melodic techno piece (but it doesn’t).</p>
<p>Imo, the lead melody sounds like it’s in a different key. Not out of tune, per se, but like it’s working from a different root note in that scale. (That can work, but I don’t think it works here.)</p>
<p>I also found those lead moments quite jarring — as though the track was suddenly trying to be something else. Just didn’t feel like it fitted well within the overall vibe of the track.</p>
<p>Similarly, some of the drum ideas aren’t working for me — e.g. the off-beat snares that start at 0:45.<br>
Drum sounds choices also don’t feel quite right.</p>
<p>The glockenspiel sound works perfectly, feels good and is a good choice within the sound palette.</p>
<p>Imo, there’s a really solid idea underneath the piece. The vibe set up at the start is great.<br>
I’d consider stripping it back to the core theme — and maybe trying a different direction.</p>
