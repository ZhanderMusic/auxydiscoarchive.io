            <p>Alright, here’s me acting seriously… <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/glacial-pack-anyone-thoughts/14561/17">spoiler</a></span><br>
This pack <strong>is</strong> really nice, Its very small and sweet. Many of the sounds I can see being incorporated into various genres, and I’m mostly looking forward to using the sounds as fills, instead of using all the sounds as drums  themselves. Looking forward to how you producers will use this pack!</p>
