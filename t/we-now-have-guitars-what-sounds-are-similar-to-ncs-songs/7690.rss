            <p>That may well be. Iâ€™m still curious to know what aspects of the NCS â€˜soundâ€™ youâ€™re planning to reproduce - and what it is youâ€™re planning to do reproduce them.</p>
<p>Plus, from what I can tell, thereâ€™s no single genre that NCS sticks to. So, what genre is it that youâ€™ll be working towards?</p>

</aside>
<p>Iâ€™d be honestly interested to know what you have planned.</p>
<p>It was all pretty tight and slick production-wise; all well made*, but I honestly didnâ€™t hear anything while scanning through their â€˜best of 2017â€™ playlist that sounded distinctly different to other labels/tracks in those genres - either in the style of tracks or the production.</p>
<p>So, Iâ€™m curious to know what youâ€™re hearing that Iâ€™m not - and how you plan to achieve it in Auxy.</p>
<p>(* Imo, the production quality is beyond whatâ€™s possible in Auxy.)</p>

From what I can tell, it covers a range of electronic sub-genres. Not sure thereâ€™s an NCS â€˜soundâ€™, unless you mean a fairly standard EDM palette.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s not a criticism of the quality of the music. I just donâ€™t hear a distinctly different â€˜soundâ€™ running through NCS releases.</p>
