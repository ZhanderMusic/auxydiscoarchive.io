            <p>October 2018… because there wasn’t anything! <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-month-was-the-best-for-packs-in-your-opinion/15312/3">spoiler</a></span></p>
<p>In all seriousness I think my best pack month was March 2018, with the introduction of Orchestral Strings. I don’t even remember the drum pack that came out but the strings were a huge game changer in many ways. It really broadened the picture for Auxy, and I think that importance made it the best.</p>
