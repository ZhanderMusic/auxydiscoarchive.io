    <title>2018 - End of year project clean up</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/2018-end-of-year-project-clean-up/13395</link>
    <description>
It&#39;s almost the end of 2018, so it&#39;s a great opportunity for a clean out. 

We all create heaps of tracks that never see the light. We may have given up on them, but perhaps someone else could use them. How many unused projects do you have? 

If you&#39;ve got any Auxy projects that you&#39;re never going to complete, then post a link to the project file here and early next year we&#39;ll move them all to the Auxy Project sharing thread, so other people can remix or incorporate them into their own tracks. 

Only post project files that you&#39;re happy for other people to use. And mention if you want any credit if it&#39;s used, or not.</description>
