    <title>Soundcloud Advice: When you fill up your upload space</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/soundcloud-advice-when-you-fill-up-your-upload-space/4629</link>
    <description>I’ve almost hit the limits of my Soundcloud. I don’t think there are any advantages in going pro at my level.

Time for a rebrand — especially when you have a low number of followers...)?

Or is it better to delete your old, unpopular stuff to make room?

Thought, opinions, what you’ve done.</description>

            <p>Do that all the time. My tracks usually always range from 15-20. I used to have a lot of bad tracks from a year ago, so nowadays, whenever I release something new and good, I typically delete an old track.</p>
<p>I still kinda want Pro though. Mainly because of Spotlight… and the advanced stats look super sweet.</p>

            <p>Assuming you’re not considering upgrading to Pro/Pro Unlimited…</p>
<p>From the various reading I’ve done, the advice I’ve seen is generally…</p>
<p>You’re best option is to delete your worst-performing tracks; tracks that simply aren’t getting m/any plays each month.<br>
Doing this on a regular basis, even without waiting to run low on space, is a good thing.</p>
<p>It’s better to periodically prune away your worst/least popular tracks, to make space for new, better material and raise the average performance of your account.<br>
(Accounts/artists with universally good track performance are more likely to be respected and taken seriously, than accounts dotted with poorly performing tracks.)</p>
<p>Instinctively, it feels painful, but trust that the tracks you’ll be deleting aren’t actually undiscovered masterpieces that will make you $$$ if only the right person heared it.<br>
They’re just the stuff we create on our journey to becoming better writers and producers.</p>
<p>Good, for their time. But, it’s not that time any more. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>(although, you can always pillage them for their best parts in future, better, tracks)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Conversely, if everything is still performing well, then maybe it’s time to step up to Pro/Pro Unlimited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’m adopting a new approach myself.<br>
If it isn’t good enough to put on Spotify, etc… and it isn’t a Demo that I’m making public in search of collaborators, I’m not putting it on SC either.</p>
<p>i.e. I won’t be using SC as my dumping ground for every idea.</p>
<p>That’ll cut down massively on SC uploads, bringing each account well within the free 3 hours.<br>
I’d revert to a free account if it didn’t mean losing the ability to replace/update tracks.</p>

            <p>Put your music on a YT channel then u can take them off your SC page.</p>
<p>Or do what I did and create a second SC page. Then u could separate your tracks in some way. (I did it by Regular stuff &amp; Auxy stuff)</p>

            <p>Or just a spillover account with a new email address. You can also upload stuff to <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> (haven’t done in awhile, I put some stuff up there maybe a decade ago) but you’re not gonna get play counts, comments, etc etc. It’s literally just for shelving something. Also, I don’t know if you give up any of your rights in doing that, I never looked into it.</p>

I saw this coming. How long? Ever since January.</p>
<p>Yes, I have a 8 minutes of Upload left for SoundCloud. Which means I have space to upload either one large song or two small songs. “Good job, Looking Back!” I deleted all of the private songs I kept before in order to put my entire Album in my SoundCloud. 2 months later, this appeared. I don’t know what to remove. You know me, I’m still broke.</p>
<p>What Imma try to do is (try to) focus on other music platforms, like Bandlab, Spotify, or frick, I might post music on my YouTube again. I probably won’t, because I am focusing on gaming there now.</p>
<p>So yeah. Just wanted to warn you guys.</p>

            <p>Another thing I forgot to mention…</p>
<p>SC gives you access to make proper ‘Buy now’ links, which can direct users to the Bandcamp (or other) page. It’s all in the Metadata tab of the Edit screen.</p>
<p>I’ve not seen how it looks once used, but it’s possibly a bit slicker than just pasting your own message + link into the description.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SC:<br>
…a ‘Buy’ button will then be rendered below the waveform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
…in case you weren’t already aware.</p>

            <p>hahaha. Yeah, you’re sane.</p>
<p>I do recommend writing all that metadata, though, because it will make you look more professional when people download your music.</p>
<p>I know I hate it when I DL a track from soundcloud and I can’t find it while DJing because it is a nondescript file.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that’s what I used to do when using a computer. But export to SC from Auxy doesn’t give you that option <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>It’s cool, I know I’m not going crazy at least then. That was actually my primary concern lol <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>The non-descript audio file happens when the audio file does not have the proper metadata, so before you release anything, write all the metadata on the actual file, because even though Soundcloud does have a “metadata” tab, it doesn’t actually write anything to the file.</p>

            <p>You know what I just realized… all of the things I tried to DL were from Auxy export direct to SC. So I’d bet that even though I named the track and all that gravy stuff for the labels and “text” on SC, the actual audio itself is probably just called audio.wav when exported. Though I don’t know how it’d handle multiple audio exports (audio1, audio2 etc?)</p>
<p>Other stuff I dl’ed I know for sure I massaged appropriately since I would have been exporting them on a computer and then uploading via the site <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>No idea about that one, although you do get the original filename when you, as the owner, opt to ‘Download original file’ in the Edit page. If you name your files cleanly before uploading, maybe that’s what you’re remembering?</p>
<p>It would make sense for SC to rename the file using the artist and trackname (or at least the original filename) when DLs are enabled.</p>

            <p>I know for one of my music projects I made a Bandcamp page, just can’t remember which. I honestly never really looked into it much. Wouldn’t hurt to give it another look…</p>
<p>I think I’m so bitter about the possibility of work being stolen because I can’t stand lazy <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/soundcloud-advice-when-you-fill-up-your-upload-space/4629/21">spoiler</a></span> people stealing from other people. Not just music, but anything - artwork, claiming the majority of work in a group project at work or school, etc. Financial considerations aside even if the tracks were posted by someone else with a different name or whatever I’d be pretty annoyed.</p>
<p>Re-reading what I wrote though, it doesn’t make much sense… given my feelings on the topic not setting to DL’able is probably best.</p>
<p>Did I make that up about the “artist name - song name” thing though on SC? I could have sworn I’ve download archived other stuff in the past and that’s how it came out…</p>

            <p>Well, when I got Pro I didn’t have a lot of songs, it was more to look cool and have Spotlight. Well, mostly Spotlight. I had hardly any views back then so the stats was more of an extra feature.</p>

            <p>Iirc, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fantom87">@Fantom87</a> allows downloads on a few tracks, fairly regularly.<br>
Might be worth hearing his rationale.</p>

<p>Sounds like you’re not bothered about the possible benefits, but don’t like the risks, which begs the question - why do it?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Have you considered putting it on Bandcamp?</p>
<p>I think you have control over the file names and you could also set the price to ‘pay what you like’. You might get a nice surprise.</p>
<p>You just link to that BC camp in your SC track description.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

            <p>I had my trqcks as Downloadable for a while, and my feiend grabbed a few songs to put on my graduation video. It was really sweet.</p>
<p>I’ve taken it off for now since I can’t see who’s downloading my tracks. I don’t think my stuff is worth much, but I hope that by asking permission I can see where my work goes — since I don’t have the same sort of access to copyright protection algorithms as big artists. If someone want to use a track on a video, I would like to know.</p>

            <p>I didn’t want to make a new topic necessarily, just need a sanity check:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any reason to NOT set your tracks to be downloadable? I’m not looking to make money on music so honestly, I don’t care if people download what I put out there. With that said though I’d be super <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_symbols_over_mouth.png?v=5" title=":face_with_symbols_over_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_symbols_over_mouth:"> pissed if someone posted my work and made a profit. I don’t think it’d happen but I can’t tolerate that kind of noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought when you downloaded a SC track it had artist name - song name? Seems to download as a non-descript file called “audio” <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/unamused.png?v=5" title=":unamused:" class="emoji" alt=":unamused:"> did something change or maybe I made that whole thing up??</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks all</p>
