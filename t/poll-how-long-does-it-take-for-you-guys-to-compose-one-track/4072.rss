            <p>It takes me like 2 hours. But that’s just the main idea. I usually listen to it for like 2 weeks without doing anything, just to see if I should post it.</p>

            <p>I chose all 4. It takes longer for some and shorter for others. Mostly because I take breaks.</p>

            <p>It always depends on how the song gets me into working on it, how inspired I am at the moment etc. but if I’m on vacation then it’s usually a couple of days, if not then a week, two weeks, or more</p>

            <p>Voted 11-15 since when I make something I don’t post it straight away. I try to listen to what I make objectively in order to pick out mistakes or try to improve sections (namely with drums and avoiding too much repetition). I post in order to move on, whether it’s a failure or a success.</p>

            <p>It usually takes me a week to make a song, but it’s sometimes longer (or shorter). I made Sulfur Caves in 8 hours straight (without eating [don’t do that]) and I finished/posted it the next day. Pastel City took a week, but some parts of it were made (as a separate project) a month before I started working on it. My song Noir took a measly 2 hours, yet it somehow got reposted a year ago.</p>

            <p>Well for me. I could take up most of the week looking and searching for good music then braking it down into my own thing, but sometimes I just like something I think of it in my head. Mostly humming the tune at school. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
<p>But mostly taking up 6-10 day more likely. That’s me for ya. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
