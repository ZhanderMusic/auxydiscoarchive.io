    <title>Auxy reposting account</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-reposting-account/1125</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a lot of people who are talented producers but are getting insufficient views per song. I think that somebody with the time to run a reposting account should create one. Then once it gets enough followers many artists will have their tracks promoted for free. This can be helpful because I&#39;ve noticed that the more views I get on a track the more confident I am. Everyone deserves to have that feeling.</description>

            <p>Actually, auxy has a SoundCloud account that reposts selected tracks <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"> Some of them even end up getting featured on the app!!</p>
