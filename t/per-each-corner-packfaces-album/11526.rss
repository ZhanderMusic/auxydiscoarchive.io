    <title>Per Each Corner - Packfaces [Album]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/per-each-corner-packfaces-album/11526</link>
    <description>hey guys! I just released my two singles as a part of my new project called “Per Each Corner” so i made this  songs and really got me worried whether they’re good or not. I’m really a rookie about music making so I just only made them for myself and suddenly shared them through soundcloud. So I’m kinda curious about what you guys think about these songs that I made. And the following days i’ll probably posting my other three tracks with the album.
