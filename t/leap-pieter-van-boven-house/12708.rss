    <title>Leap - Pieter van Boven [House]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/leap-pieter-van-boven-house/12708</link>
    <description>From all the concepts I made this year, I struggled the most with this track. I wanted it to be a more ambient track, but then I realised this was a perfect opportunity for some house. 

It has some snappy beats and bongos.
Enjoy!
