            <p>I was up for doing a comic convention as a guest illustrator in July but that fell through. So I’ve got a bunch of rough ups for a coloring book I was going to make. I’m think about finishing it up and throwing it at Amazon as hard as I can  and see if it makes a dent.</p>

            <p>Said once, will say again - your illustrations are awesome. I would strongly consider doing something with them!! Creepy isn’t bad <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>That’s all just my sketch works. I’m an illustrator by hobby. Might do more with it eventually.<br>
It’s generally just kind of creepy.</p>

            <p>My apologies. Didn’t think pg-13 was too much. I suppose full G rating is the only safe way to interact now I suppose.</p>

            <p>Yeah a lot of pretty bad ass dub, trap, and tech guys on here.<br>
I can’t compete and really don’t  listen to that stuff much anymore so I’m not sure what direction that stuffs going.<br>
So I’ve personally elected to go the terror noise sound. Someone’s gotta make something nobody else wants to listen to.</p>
