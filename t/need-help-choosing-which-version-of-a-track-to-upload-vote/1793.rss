            <p>I’m only saying this as my track has only two plays and IAATOE has 4 so it looks like there’s some bias people voting but that’s all I don’t mean to sound like this but it’s only fair I would have said the same thing if it was the other way around<br>
I’m only trying to make this a fair poll</p>
