    <description>When I first used acoustic guitars in auxy I was like how can I make the guitar sound like a clean strum. well for a year I toiled around with the guitars and finally I figured it out! The guitars to begin with already have a bit of a strum to them naturally but if you pitch them down a whole octave it slows the strum effect significantly which makes it sound amazingly clean. Another little tip for arp guitars chords is to add an 3/16 delay which makes sound a ton fuller.</description>

            <p>You can do this at slower tempo too. The best way is to use 1/32 notes, and put one or two notes in one step early, and one or two notes one step late, with the bulk of the notes right on the one beat.  Generally it’s best to go low to high, so if you have a 6 note chord, put the lowest note 1/32 early, and  The highest note or two 1/32 late.  Imuse this all the time, so if anyone wants me to post an example, I’d be happy to.</p>

            <p>Cool! I didn’t know this, thanks for sharing!</p>
<p>Another way to do it is to set your notes to 1/32 and set the tempo to 180 or above. For a chord, put the last note on the beat, and for each note after, set it one step back. I can make a demo project explaining if you would like.</p>
