    <title>#happyhiphop song challengeeeeeee</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/happyhiphop-song-challengeeeeeee/3150</link>
    <description>I NEED you hiphop / funk interested guys and gals to make a full track out of this bad boy (since this genre is totally underrepresented here). Also it&#39;s a happy beat where I&#39;m not feeling the most save in :P I’m maybe doing it myself as well - but happy to see where you might take things to! 

The rules are:
- use the parts provided in your song - or only change them as little as possible
- keep it vinyl&#39;y and classy (interpretation allowed here though)
- recommendation for ongoing collaboration: make a beat with a structure that allows a verse, where you can rap over :)

I&#39;ll pick my personal favorite and then say let&#39;s maybe even find someone who wants to rap over this – I&#39;d be willing to edit and structure / mix everything in ableton (which Im learning currently) and - dang - we&#39;ve got ourselves a trio-collab track that makes people wanna say &#39;aaaahhh yeeeaazz&#39; :) :D 

Also: if you have favorites among the submissions, you may fiend yourself a collab partner, to create a dope song yourself. maybe an other-genre version of this...

            <p>Would you say this is still open? I mainly make hip hop, rap beats on Auxy, and I feel like I can make something out of this.</p>
