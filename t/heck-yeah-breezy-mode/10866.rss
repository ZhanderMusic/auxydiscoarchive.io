    <title>Heck Yeah! - Breezy mode</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/heck-yeah-breezy-mode/10866</link>
    <description>Just finished my second track on soundcloud today. I was trying to work on a more melodic sound and I&#39;m pretty excited about how it turned out and curious to hear all of your thoughts! This community continues to astound me with how active everyone is, the feedback you all gave me on my last track really helped mold my growing skills as an artist and create an even better second track! Enjoy!
