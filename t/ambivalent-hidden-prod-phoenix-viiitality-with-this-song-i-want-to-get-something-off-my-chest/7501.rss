    <title>Ambivalent (hidden prod. Phoenix) - Viiitality // With this song I want to get something off my chest</title>

    <description>first of all, @Phoenix sorry for finishing this song, you never sent back a link and I really liked this song...and so did my dad.

last March, 11 months ago, my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. the disease slowly turned an active, energetic man sluggish and inattentive. March was when I started taking Auxy seriously and started posting my music.

Dad was always a bit more supportive of my bad music than my Mom, but after listening to the first 32 bars of this song both immediately loved it. I  said I’d work on it soon, but got distracted by school, swim, and the decreasing health of my dad.

after a disastrous series of events, on February 1st, my dad passed away. I never got the time to fully finish this song, so I spent this weekend tinkering with sounds, drums, and others with him in mind.

@Dj_Peloton, I’m sincerely praying for your cousin because I, and I’m sure many other feel your pain. take a break, it’s good for you and will clean your mind for a bit.

hope you’ll enjoy this song. stay strong.

<p>So sorry about this, dude. I almost put a sad emoji in but that seems disrespectful, so instead I’ll take a listen and let you know what I think. It’s a shame he never got to hear the finished song.</p>
