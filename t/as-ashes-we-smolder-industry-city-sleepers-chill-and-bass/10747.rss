Ok. I know. Three in one week. I swear this is the last upload for awhile, I had all these in the pipeline and I just don&#39;t want to sit on this anymore.

This track started MONTHS ago and I hated it. So I completely gutted it. Then I deleted it. This final version was born out of a submission to the stock music site Pond5 that was rejected. Just because they didn&#39;t like it though didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t, so, I decided to completely re-work it into the original and Auxy-ify it. There are still remnants of GarageBand iOS in here (how the song originally came to fruition), along with blocs wave (of course) and naturally, straight Auxy sounds and samples.

Anyways, enjoy - comments / suggestions / small bowls of mini popcorn shrimp are happily accepted.</description>

            <p>I enjoyed this track to a point. I appreciate the effort to blend the traditional melodic with the techno, but there still tends to be some discord between the two. I wish I could offer some suggestions, but the genre is beyond my expertise. I look forward to more like it, if you are so inclined to continue.</p>
