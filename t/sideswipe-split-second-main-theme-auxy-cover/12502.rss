    <description>tried my &quot;best&quot; to cover the main theme to my favourite racing game of all time, didn&#39;t go so well but it&#39;s okay.

            <p>what a strange coincidence. both released close to eachother and are both arcade racing games made by experienced studios, and both got good reviews but didn’t push many sales. both games also killed their respective studios while their sequels were in development. sad.</p>

            <p>Yeah… they were going to make a sequel to Split/Second AND Blur, but both got cancelled, and Blur’s development team went bankrupt…</p>

            <p>oh yeah, blur’s another one of my faves. shame that and split/second released at the same time and killed each other’s sales.</p>

            <p>I like it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Man the nostalgia is real…</p>
<p>(I use to love playing split/second with my family, good times.)<br>
Have you ever played “Blur”?</p>
