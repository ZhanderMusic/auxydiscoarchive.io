Easy, laid-back jazz-fusion track.

Current WIP.
Inspiration struck y&#39;day evening, and this is where things currently stand.

The main structures and motifs are in, but still needs lots of work throughout.


&amp;nbsp;

My Black Node stuff is typically more uptempo (145–170), so I may rebuild it as an uptempo track — or make an alt/VIP version that&#39;s more &#39;my tempo&#39; — and keep this as the laid-back version.

&amp;nbsp;
Thoughts and comments welcome.

Enjoy :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>That sustained string note was a layer later in the piece (a throwback to '70s soul), but I thought it would make a decent intro to kinda set a tension, but then it turns into a different role when the jazz chords come in and reveal the real tonal context.</p>
<p>The whole thing still feels a bit ‘nice’ right now. Lacks/needs an ‘edge’. Something to make it feel a bit more authentic or moody. Not sure it fits into the Black Node body of work in its current form/vibe.</p>

            <p>Woah dude I love it! I like how you used that string at the start to keep tension and overall a very chill track. Nice</p>
