    <title>Are there any FREE labels to submit music to?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/are-there-any-free-labels-to-submit-music-to/15501</link>
    <description>I have been looking at submitting songs to labels, and have noticed that a lot of them require a donation before they will repost the track. 


Are there any free EDM labels out there?</description>

            <p>there’s been a lot of them in the past, freeform was the first one but it’s not just auxy-exclusive stuff anymore, frontier would probably be your best bet, seeing as many auxy artists have released there and it has a more upbeat style than freeform, melo, and five</p>

            <p>We should start a free Auxy Label. And just separate by genre and repost. I think AUXY has a unique sound that a lot of people would get into if they heard it</p>

            <p>Definitely advise what <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/foryou">@foryou</a> said and get yourself a Discord account. There are countless artists and connections to be made on that platform from collaboration opportunities to live show availabilities. Essentially, I’d say if you’re not on Discord and you’re aiming to grow your network you’re cutting yourself off from a huge source of potential contacts.</p>

            <p>I’ve had success on Twitter. There’s a lot of very receptive artists and internet radio station DJ’s who are always on the lookout for folks with new music. I’d say building connections and being engaged with other artists is paramount</p>

            <p>I agree with this, but if you’re looking for more exposure, I’d suggest looking for a bigger label network as many of the Auxy labels are more standalone projects with &gt;1000 followers on soundcloud. That being said, I did get my start from releasing with Frontier <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>It sounds like you’re getting “labels” and “promo channels” confused.</p>
<p>Labels are the accounts that will <strong>release</strong> your song, usually on their account, and should have a demo submissions link on their page, for example:</p>
<p><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/2/2cbc41c7685c8e1e28abf8194cab36c343a3189c.png" alt="image" width="332" height="168"></p>
<p>Promo channels are the accounts that will <strong>repost</strong> your song, sometimes for a bit of green <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/moneybag.png?v=9" title=":moneybag:" class="emoji" alt=":moneybag:"> like you said, and usually don’t require more than a follow / like on their page to become “eligible” for their promotion. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/c/cdaff187b5a2fb349c733ebaa1f40ad8d114e667.png" alt="image" width="329" height="430"></p>
<p>I personally don’t go around messaging promo channels (let alone paying for them) because I find them to be a complete waste of time due to the high volume of tracks that they actually promote (your track will get buried almost instantly and it provides no real engagement). I’d stick to growing your audience in a more organic manner and building up contacts that you know to help promote your music.</p>

            <p>if you’re looking for a label to start releasing on, it depends on what genre you make. look for a label that focuses on a genre similar to the stuff you make. i’d recommend starting out with the auxy-related labels like “frontier”, “melo”, and my personal favorite, “five”.</p>

            <p>Most labels that accept demos will have contact info in their Soundcloud profiles.<br>
I’d start there.</p>

            <p>I’m no expert at this, but given the climate of the industry, I think you’d have more success running through repost networks and self promotion. You can release music for free through sites like BandCamp and distributors like Amuse. There’s a few to choose from.</p>
<p>A label (in the traditional sense) is going to be interested in making money. That’s what they do, that’s what they are there for. There’s quite a lot of people who write music, so it’s more likely they’ll want to pick up already established artists with a following so that they don’t have to take a chance paying out of pocket on an unknown. The only advantage I can think of with submitting work to any kind of label as opposed to self releasing is promotion.</p>
<p>I’ve been told getting your music out there is 10% production and 90% promotion. It’s probably true. I don’t say all this to discourage you, by all means, I’d shoot out my work everywhere, but, definitely don’t PAY UP FRONT that’s ridiculous. That’s like paying to have something done around your house in full before the job is even started…</p>

            <p>what kind of labels r you looking at? most of the one’s i know are free to submit (at least a demo. idk about further, but unless you’re attempting to get onto some massive label, shouldn’t be more than a few bucks honestly).</p>
<p>hecc the auxy related ones should be a good start if you want free all around lol</p>

            <p>I have been looking at submitting songs to labels, and have noticed that a lot of them require a donation before they will repost the track.</p>
<p>Are there any free EDM labels out there?</p>
