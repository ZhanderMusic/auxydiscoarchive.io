    <title>Where to look for music?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-to-look-for-music/17901</link>
    <description>Right, now I am really starting to like all sorts of music (especially electronic), but it&#39;s depressing how I can&#39;t seem to find/come across music which leaves me uninspired, and if I do find any it is mainstream garbage. Any suggestions as to what I can do? Are there any popular labels you suggest I follow?

I am also just being recommended dubstep or other heavy genres on soundcloud. What do I do?</description>

            <p>I think online record stores <a href="http://bleep.com">bleep.com</a> and <a href="http://boomkat.com">boomkat.com</a> are a great place to start.</p>
<p>They’re well curated, and the editorial staff do a fantastic job with descriptions.</p>

            <p>I just search for playlists on SoundCloud and Spotify until I find one were I really like the 1 first song, then I listen to a few more songs and if they all sound like the genre I want to listen to I like/save it</p>
