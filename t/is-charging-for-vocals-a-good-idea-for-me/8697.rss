    <description>I&#39;m so indecisive, lol. If I were to charge, it would be $10 for vocals, and $15 for vocals, and lyrics. Good idea or no?</description>

<p>Have you heard of Austin Haga and Bradley Saint James? Their music…</p>
<p>…Austin is like the most popular Auxy producer out there. If you’ve never even heard his music, then I’m not sure you know exactly what people can do on Auxy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hmmm <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:">  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I think what Nick is partly talking about is that the Auxy community can be quite insular, perhaps showing a little too much deference to achievements within the world of Auxy - a tiny bubble that few outside the bubble know about and even fewer care about - rather than considering broader habits and practices, and how they might reflect on what even the most successful Auxy users have so far achieved.</p>
<p>To some extent, that goes for the app too. It’s isolating itself - and again, to some extent, its users - by design. It’s built specifically to be a standalone app (a walled garden) that doesn’t integrate well with larger workflows. This encourages users to think of it as the A to Z of their music creation process. That thinking might not be the right one for creating our best music.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, there’s probably a reason why you don’t hear about established artists using Auxy exclusively.</p>
<p>Auxy does some pretty impressive things, for sure. And, there are users making some impressive music. But whether something that’s ‘impressive’ inside the Auxy community actually translates to ‘impressive’ outside the Auxy community, well, that’s still a question at this point.</p>
<p>I think the more aware we are of the standards expected outside the Auxy community, the more we improve our chances of achieving real success.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by this…? If by “it” you mean Auxy, then don’t all DAW’s require you to use them and don’t venture into the world of production themselves?

            <p>Hm, Austin is like the most popular Auxy producer out there. If you’ve never even heard his music, then I’m not sure you know exactly what people can do on Auxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auxy isn’t part of the music industry. Auxy is a software, not a label, a magazine, or a publisher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never said it was. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very exclusive, and extremely self-containing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How so? You can buy it free on the app-store and there’s nothing stopping you from working up the ranks as a producer. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It requires the Artist to use Auxy and doesn’t reach out to others.<br>
It doesn’t add any value to the rest of the industry at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually there’s a lot of people on here that are on Spotify, i-Tunes, etc. We may not be bringing in the big bucks, but that doesn’t mean we can’t still be part of the industry. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Actually, I have seen “Austin Haga,” but I’ve yet to listen to his music, and I haven’t heard of “Bradley Saint James.” But, I assume that they’ve invested time in their music, which is different from a lot of other producers.</p>
<p>Auxy isn’t part of the music industry. Auxy is a software, not a label, a magazine, or a publisher.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the Auxy community.<br>
It isn’t part of the music industry. It is very exclusive, and extremely self-containing.<br>
It requires the Artist to use Auxy and doesn’t reach out to others.<br>
It doesn’t add any value to the rest of the industry at all.  [1]</p>
<p>[1] Not that this is a bad thing. This forum and its community isn’t supposed to be part of everything else.<br>
It’s purpose is to be exclusive and self-contaionging.</p>

            <p>Have you heard of Austin Haga and Bradley Saint James? Their music sounds like a little more than just “making beats” to me… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png?v=5" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"></p>
<p>Sure, Auxy can’t do everything other music softwares do, but to say we’re not even part of the music industry sounds a little extreme to me. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

            <p>Well for one, in the music industry, you have to invest in things.</p>
<p>You have to invest money.<br>
Whether it be gear (software, hardware), talent (singers, session players, etc), tools (sample packs, plugins, etc), or even Facebook ads, you’ve got to spend a bit.</p>
<p>And, you’ve got to invest time.<br>
It’s not just learning how to “make beats,” or learning how to make a new genre, but learning the craft, how to get better, and finding your “sound.”<br>
And going out to clubs and parties to listen to new/interesting stuff that will grow your musical palette.<br>
Or, meeting more artists out there who know more than you so that you can learn from them.</p>
<p>Auxy can be a tool, for some, but can be a comfort zone for others.</p>
