I saw this coming. How long? Ever since January.

Yes, I have a 8 minutes of Upload left for SoundCloud. Which means I have space to upload either one large song or two small songs. “Good job, Looking Back!” I deleted all of the private songs I kept before in order to put my entire Album in my SoundCloud. 2 months later, this appeared. I don’t know what to remove. You know me, I’m still broke. 

What Imma try to do is (try to) focus on other music platforms, like Bandlab, Spotify, or frick, I might post music on my YouTube again. I probably won’t, because I am focusing on gaming there now.

So yeah. Just wanted to warn you guys.</description>
