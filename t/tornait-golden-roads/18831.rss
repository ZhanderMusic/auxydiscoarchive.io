I&#39;m back! I&#39;ve been in a rather deep depression lately, caused by a family emergency and exacerbated by the recent pandemic. Finally, I got the urge to create, and I dusted off an old, unfinished project and polished it up with love, care, sweat, and tears.

The fruits of my labor, a love letter to my home city of LA. Hope you enjoy.</description>

            <p>I think “game music” has really become my signature style. I’ll just really embrace it from now on. Of course, go into new things and make stuff fresh overall, but I’m starting to truly be happy with what I’m doing again.</p>
<p>The vocal shouts and ad-libs are inspired by Hideki Naganuma’s stuff. He’s the composer of soundtracks for games like Sega Rally, Jet Set Radio and Sonic Rush. He and another composer named Jake Kaufman are my two producing heroes.</p>
