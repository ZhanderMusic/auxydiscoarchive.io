This track is still a little muddy. I can&#39;t seem to finish the first chorus and start the break afterwards. I&#39;ve been working on it for about a month now but I can&#39;t seem to get anywhere with it. Help would be greatly appreciated!!</description>

            <p>I’ve never collabed with anyone before so I’m not 100% sure how it works but itd be cool to try it! What I want with the track right now is to get the base of it down and then perfect it later. I’m really going for that joyful house vibe like what galantis or tobu makes.</p>
