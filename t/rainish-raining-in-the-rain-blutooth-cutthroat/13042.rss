    <title>Rainish Raining...in the Rain... Blutooth Cutthroat</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/rainish-raining-in-the-rain-blutooth-cutthroat/13042</link>
    <description> This is a wet and rainy meditative track, the kind that just flows out of Auxy quite easily! I doubt that anyone has ever done a rainy track with bleeps and boops. ðŸ˜œ

Enjoy and let me know what you think! Cheers and keep dry!
