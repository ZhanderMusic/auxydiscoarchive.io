This was a challenge to make, as I was tasked with making a song using Bow, Crater, Craft, Stance, Climb, Bumble and Ocean. I added in Leaf to make it a bit more whole and overall I think it created a great slow tempo jam. Of course it could sound a bit like stock Auxy but I love the sound natural Auxy can make, and I think the challenge itself was quite interesting.</description>
