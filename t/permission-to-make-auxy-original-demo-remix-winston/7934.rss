    <title>Permission to make Auxy original demo remix? (Winston)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/permission-to-make-auxy-original-demo-remix-winston/7934</link>
    <description>The original Auxy demo when it was before all the automation and stuff was my most favourite of the four original demos, and I was thinking or making a remix, but it was @Auxy and the team who made the project. So I was wondering if I could make a post out a remix of it, while crediting the team in the title of it.

            <p>Well, I got a demo (pun not intended) of what I have so far, and it sounds pretty good so far in my opinion, and Iâ€™m currently focusing on the melody throughout the song before smoothing it down to make it sound nice and less choppy:</p>
