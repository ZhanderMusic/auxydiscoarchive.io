            <p>Ehh personally I’m against paying for something like that. Figure you could get onto a small/med size label in that time and probably pay less.</p>
<p>I havent seen artists referencing places like reverb nation, but usually just they threw tracks around and people picked them up.</p>
<p>Edit: looked up some reviews for them. Nearly every review site I looked at seems to label those guys as a scam. Don’t do it.</p>
