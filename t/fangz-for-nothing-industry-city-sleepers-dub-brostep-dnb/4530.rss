SOOOO, this actually is what was born out of the &quot;What&#39;s your least favorite sound&quot; thread. You lot inspired me to jam as many of the sounds people were naming in one track that I could. Here&#39;s the full list of the sounds I used, in order:

Charge
Mold
Subway
Bumble
Scarf (I might or might not have used this pattern??)
Castle
Marble
Freak
Scarf
Sweeper

All non-AP sounds.

Fun fact: This was going to be my submission for the second Auxy tournament that&#39;s going on now but decided against it.

Guess that&#39;s about it I&#39;ll stop blabbering now :smiley:</description>
