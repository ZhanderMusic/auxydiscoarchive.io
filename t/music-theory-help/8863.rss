            <p>Yes and no, it depends on what style you’re going for, if you’re following traditional harmonic progressions, and many other things. As a rule of thumb, yes you want it to be the root note and to change it up you use inversions to make the gaps not as large between notes sometimes, or if you repeat a chord you can invert it to progress the melody a bit.</p>
<p>I’ll be watching this thread more now as I have a lot of (classical) music theory experience so I will be able to help out as well as the other poster’s here.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I totally agree here(that’s why I wrote that it’s good in its own way, but I probably didn’t emphasize that enough). There is much beauty in regular scales themselves, and they shouldn’t be not used.</p>

            <p>It’s all good. I played guitar for 20 years completely self taught. None of this really made sense to me until recently.</p>
<p>No one needs to know any of this to use Auxy and that is the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It is helpful (but far from necessary) to know this stuff for these three reasons.</p>
<p>1 understand to get ideas down faster with less hunting and pecking</p>
<p>2 communicate these ideas with others using a common language.</p>
<p>3 once you get this it can open up a whole world of other topics that can help you understand <em>why</em> something in particular sounds good. Which is either interesting on its own or helpful if you are trying to make something else sound good.</p>

            <p>TBH, I get lost pretty quickly when it gets to notes. I still couldnt reliably point to a C if my life depended on it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
(I’m not overly worried by my lack of formal music knowledge. Yet.)</p>
<p>I play entirely by ear. That’s why it’s important for me to have all options available at all times. I don’t ‘plan’ chords. I don’t know if my next chord will be major, minor or something else specifically. I don’t know if I’ll be laying down major chords, then using a minor note in the melody to spin the moment.</p>
<p>I feel and intuit my way through my compositions.<br>
(Obviously, about as antithetical to this topic as it gets, so I’ll shut up now. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Great point. Rarely I’ll throw one chromatic loop in occasionally for melodies. I never use it for chords or complex patterns.</p>
<p>I actually use the pitch automation to hit those in between notes most often. Either as a bend for a passing (or transient note outside of the key briefly) or just automated as a fixed position for an long note outside of the key. I just go by ear when setting the automation. Don’t want to overthink that stuff if that is the reason you are doing it.</p>
<p>And it is all relative to what else is going on.<br>
To put it simply, some of the scale degrees on the standard settings <em>are</em> those interesting notes relative to some of the chords that you can make up with the 1 to 7 intervals.</p>
<p>It makes sense when you try it.<br>
But here is kind of why it works.</p>
<p>The context of the underlying chord is important. A 1 note on a 2-4-6 chord is a spicy note. (And I made a mistake above that I will go in and correct and then delete this note too). This is because of the half and whole step intervals that <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/shepdoge">@Shepdoge</a> described…</p>
<p>In C Minor mode a 2-4-6 chord is actually a D minor chord. The notes in a D minor scale are DEFGA <em>B flat</em> C<br>
Remember that in the C minor setting the columns are CD Eb F G Ab Bb So while you are playing that 2-4-6 chord the 3 and 5 in the C minor key are not in the D minor scale.</p>
<p>So for the same reason 9,11,13th notes can make a chord interesting, you can use the same concept with your melody in the <em>context of the underlying chord</em> to generate the same interest.</p>
<p>The only time I’d typically use chromatic mode depends on if  I need one of those extended scale notes while playing certain chords (such as the 1-3-5)</p>

            <p>Sorry mate but I’m going to have to pull you up on a few bits of incorrect information. Other than these issues, you’ve explained the basics in a relatively cohesive manner <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

<blockquote>

<p>G is the fifth scale degree in the key of C major, not F, which is the fourth degree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make a major scale minor the rule is to make the 3rd scale degree flat (lower pitched) by one half step.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’ll also need to flatten the 6th and 7th degrees of the major scale to get the parallel minor. What you’ve described here is the melodic minor scale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any three or more notes at the same time is called chord and a chord with three notes is called a tritonal chord.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’ll hear chords with three different notes called “triads” more often. Chords with more than those three notes (not sure about seventh chords) are usually called extended chords (i.e. chords with added 9ths, 11ths, 13ths)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…a 2-4-6 from the C major scale would be a D major and a 3-5-7 an E major.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the C major scale, the 2-4-6 chord will be a minor chord. Why, you ask? The intervals, if we were to play a major scale, would be:</p>
<p>W-W-H-W-W-W-H<br>
(or in C major)<br>
C-D-E-F-G-A-B</p>
<p>H = halfstep/semitone/1 note on the chromatic scale<br>
W = wholestep/tone/2 notes on the chromatic scale</p>
<p>Another example in G major:<br>
G-A-B-C-D-E-F#</p>
<p>And F major:<br>
F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E</p>
<p>The 2nd, 4th and 6th degrees have different spacing to the 1st, 3rd and 5th degrees. The minor [ii] chord in the key of C major (D minor) has only 3 halfsteps/semitones to get from D (the root note of the chord) to the next note in the scale, which is F (the third interval of the chord). That’s, as you said, the difference between a major chord and a minor chord; the third interval. Minor thirds = 3 semitones, and major thirds = 4 semitones</p>
<p>This is also the same for the minor [iii] chord in C major (E minor), but instead of typing that all again, I’ll just post a picture of all the chords in C maj:</p>

</aside>
<p>How often do you move from a major chord/melody to a minor (or vice versa) in a track?</p>
<p>Having that option constantly and immediately available while I’m exploring is why I only ever use chromatic mode.</p>
<p>Plus, if you’re using preset Major or Minor modes, you can’t have any juicy, jazzy, soulful little flicks and bends.</p>

<p>A lot of this will seem correct or obvious if you have played with chords in Auxy much. I want to write now about why it sounds the way it does when you add up notes to make chords. Now that you understand about scale degrees.</p>
<p>Let’s start with talking about intervals between notes in a scale. I already mentioned about how a 1 and a 2 notes at the same time will sound less in tune with each other than a 1 and a 5. (By the way the same is true if you were comparing a 3 and a 4 to a 3 and a 7 for example) you can hear this yourself by experimenting if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>We call a 1 and a 5 at the same time a perfect fifth. And a 1 and a 3 is a 3rd. Notice the interval between a 1 and a 3 and a 3 and a 5 are the same. We call this stacking thirds. In this three note “stacked third” you can hear the effect of 1-3, 3-5 and 1-5 all at the same time.</p>
<p>Any three or more notes at the same time is called chord and a chord with three notes is often called a triad.</p>
<p>A 1,3,5 chord is called a major or minor chord depending on whether the 3rd scale degree is from a major or minor chord. The chord is named after the name of the 1st degree note. If the chord is built from a C major scale like in my previous post and is a 1-3-5 chord it is a C major chord.</p>
<p>A lot of people have already heard that major chords often have a happier or positive quality and that minor chords have a more sad or apprehensive quality, but the reality is that this depends entirely on the context that this chord is played in. That’s for another lesson on chord progressions.</p>
<p>We can add more than 3 notes to a chord of course. Adam Neely on YouTube does a lot of really great music theory videos. He described the additional notes beyond the 3 note tritonal chord as adding additional flavor to that chord. So a if we stack another third on to our 1-3-5 chord we have a 1-3-5-7. This is called a 7th chord. Again depending on whether the 3 is flat or not this would either be a major 7th or a minor 7th. And it has a quality of being a little more interesting than the regular major or minor. You get a little more complexity in the sound because you are now getting the interaction between 1-3, 1-5, 1-7, 3-5, 3-7,and 5-7.</p>
<p>Chords with more than 3 notes are called extended chords. Makes sense when you think about how those additional tones change the way the basic triad sounds.</p>
<p>I didn’t mention this previously, but you can keep numbering above 7 as well. An 8 is the same as a 1, but one octave higher. A 9 is the same as a 2 but one octave higher and so on.</p>
<p>So we could keep stacking thirds past the 7th degree.<br>
A 1-3-5-7-9 chord is called a major or minor 9th and is really complex. A whole other set of interactions on top of what we had in the 7th. These 9th chords are common in both electronic and jazz music.</p>
<p>Since a 9 and a 2 are really the same letter note but an octave apart a 1-3-5-7-9 chord is actually the same as a 1-2-3-5-7 chord! They will sound slightly different of course, but both the tonality (C,D,E,etc) and the quality (happy, sad, simple, complex, jazzy, etc) will be similar.</p>
<p>You can keep adding notes all the way up and down the scale degrees- 13th, 14th etc. but after the 7 you are really just either duplicating or filling notes in the 1 to 7 scale at higher (or lower) octaves.</p>
<p>You can add some additional flavor or seasoning in to change the quality of the chords by filling in some of the other gaps between these intervals. There are names for what happens if you add in a 4 or a flat 9 for example, but you could go on with that stuff for ever and I can’t keep them straight.</p>
<p>But this is one of the ways in which Auxy or really any electronic music tool excels. On a guitar you can only play 6 notes at the most at once (one for each string). On a piano you are limited to 10 fingers.</p>
<p>Who knows what the limit is on simultaneous tones in Auxy. Not only can you play <em>many</em> notes at once, you can also play many instruments at once. And with delays and extended reverb you can have (for example) a 9-11-13 chord trailing on still while you move into a 1-3-5-7 chord and the bass plays a 4th degree thus creating that massive sounding magical (or horrible depending on the context) Dminor13add4 chord.</p>
<p>And again you did it without even knowing the names of the notes go into the D minor scale. In this lesson you just had counting to thirteen!</p>
<p>(Edit: Again corrected for accuracy, thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/shepdoge">@Shepdoge</a> per the below reply.)</p>

            <p>Not disagreeing, but sometimes leaving out all those in between notes is helpful when it comes to playing in key and creating good sounding chords for people of any skill level. I almost never use chromatic mode.</p>

            <p>Why are the columns labeled 1,3,5 and 7 and what does thinking about it that way do for me?<br>
Simplifies understanding scales and keys.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things I learned has to do with a thing called Scale Degrees.<br>
I learned it a long time ago, but I really “get it” now because of the way Auxy is set up. I’m sure this will help someone and will seem basic to others.</p>
<p>So for example:<br>
in the C major scale the notes are<br>
C D E F G A B<br>
This is the 'ole Do Re Mi… etc</p>
<p>We can number these as scale degrees<br>
C D E F G A B<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7</p>
<p><em>This is why there are 7 columns in Auxy and what they represent</em></p>
<p>If you are in the Key of C major in settings, the columns left to right are C D E F G A B.</p>
<p>If we play mostly these notes in a song, it is considered to be in the key of C major.<br>
These notes are mostly going to sound good together. The farther two notes are from each other the better they are going to sound together. For example C (the 1st degree) and G (the fifth degree) sound good together. C and D (1 and 2) at the same time doesn’t sound as harmonious C and G. But they are still in the same key so they work great in the context of a song. They do sound more uncomfortable together, not great, but still ok. C and C# (1 and 1.5 I guess) are too close together - doesn’t sound good to most people.</p>
<p>When auxy is not in chromatic mode, none of those .5 scale degree intervals are shown. This makes in dead simple to play “in key”.</p>
<p>But there are all kinds of scales!<br>
To make a major scale into a melodic minor the rule is to make the 3rd, 6th and 7th scale degrees flat (lower pitched) by one half step.<br>
This is always the rule, no matter with which letter note you are starting.</p>
<p>So the C Minor scale notes become<br>
C D Eb F G Ab Bb</p>
<p>But here’s the cool thing… we can still number these as scale degrees the same way as with the major scale.<br>
C D Eb F G Ab Bb<br>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7<br>
because C is the first note, D is the second, and now Eb is the third instead of E etc.</p>
<p>So in auxy the the third column changes from E to Eb when you change the key from C major to C minor and the columns stay 1 to 7.</p>
<p>You can play in any key (major or minor) without having to know what the notes in that scale are.<br>
I don’t need to know which notes need to be flat or sharp to make a clean Do Re Mi scale when starting with any other note. Again dead simple.</p>
<p>The scales degrees for major scales are always: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7<br>
For minor scales the notes are always: 1,2, flat 3,4,5, flat 6, flat 7.<br>
But in Auxy, its simplified. Still  the columns are always 1 to 7.</p>
<p>Now you can change the key from C to anything else that you want and it will always work.<br>
You don’t have to know what notes make up a F# scale because the scale degrees are always 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.<br>
And if you only play those notes in a song they will probably sound like they belong together.</p>
<p>Next lesson: how thinking about numbered scale degrees is magical when it comes to Chords!</p>
<p>Someone said that knowing math helps. It not so much math as just being able to count to 7.</p>

            <p>It’s also pretty key to understand that different scales use different notes – some are left out or added in depending if the scale is in major, minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor… or even what note the scale is starting on. That’s why chromatic scales can be so nice, because it allows one to use the whole range of actual notes -vs. picking the key of the scale you have will only give you the notes in that scale, which is a good in it’s own way.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s important to understand what they are. Triplets are technically out of time- they force 3 notes into the space 4 notes normally take. The key to using triplets is making sure the phrase is really clearly using triplets and then moving back to regular notes. Example- you may have a phrase taking up beats 1&amp;2 but in beat 3 start the beat with a triplet and fill it (so three notes) then go back to the original feel at beat 4. Don’t overuse them and it does take practice to get a feel for them!</p>

            <p>I usually skulk around the subreddit for music theory for scraps of knowledge. Alhough there is a wealth of information, I do advise that new topics are generally aimed at people with an advanced understanding of the subject (not always) Therefore, if you are a beginner theorist, use the search function to locate resources and discussions related to concepts that are relevant to you rather than be overwhelmed with stuff that’s confusing (like I usually am).</p>

            <p>For learning the basics of chord construction and scales/arpeggios, experimenting/learning with some sort of keyboard or piano can really help. Since a keyboard doesn’t take much practice to actually play a note, it can be really easy to pick up(of course, if you just want to pick it up to learn some theory) and experiment. There’s always some sort of math involved in forming chords, scales, and arps as well, so looking into that can help too!</p>
