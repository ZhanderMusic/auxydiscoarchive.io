    <title>Remix a sad song into a really fun one! </title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/remix-a-sad-song-into-a-really-fun-one/11992</link>
    <description>Hey guys! So I’m still kinda new to Auxy but I wanted to do a contest because it looks really fun! So I decided that it would be cool to see if you guys can remix my song, Please Don’t Let These Tears Fall Again. It’s currently a sad/chill song and I think it’d be cool to see it remixes into an upbeat dance song or something else. If you’re interested then just reply to the thread thxxxx^^</description>

            <p>I totally forgot to put in a cut off date, I don’t know how long it takes to make a remix so for now I’ll set the cutoff date for September 17 (you can submit before then though) and anyone who needs more time can just say so before the day of. Thx guys!</p>
