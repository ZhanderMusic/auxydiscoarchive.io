            <p>Thanks for noticing. I thought so too, but my opinion subjective. Nice to get a confirmation. Lately I’ve been getting my inspiration from the demo tracks Auxy has been sending. I listen to a loop and if it triggers a response from me I run with it. I also feed off what others are doing, and their suggestions. There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t spends time working on a piece. Everything I create is done using my iPhone. I enjoy the convenience of it. I have a full time job and during my lunch break, usually at a Starbucks, I work on my music. I also fit it in in the morning before going to work and of course in the evenings. I find it very therapeutic.</p>

            <p>Fwiw, imo, it seems like your more recent stuff is a step up from your earlier pieces.<br>
They’re more sophisticated and have a bit more personality in subtle ways.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I don’t spend as much on finishing the tracks as I should. I find creating the track much more gratifying. I’ll try and get better at it.</p>

            <p>Just listened to this. It popped up in the bg as a Next Up track.<br>
Was really enjoying it, checked out to see who did it… and now here I am. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>A really good piece.<br>
Simple, with some nice production layers and touches.</p>
<p>Begging to be finished as a chilled neo-soul vocal track, imo.</p>
<p>Liked and Followed (under my second SC account: Grand Narrows)</p>

            <p>I enjoyed this! It felt like it ended kind of abruptly, where you stopped it you definitely could have moved into a new melody and bass structure. I was really hoping for some low pass high hats or similar to come in, maybe with some variation in drum timing and that would have been the perfect place to do it. Overall though the whole feel of the piece is nice (especially on my miserable rainy train ride to wok <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/tired_face.png?v=5" title=":tired_face:" class="emoji" alt=":tired_face:">)</p>
