    <title>How do you bring those Low Ends to Glory ? </title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-do-you-bring-those-low-ends-to-glory/12033</link>
    <description>Hi everybody!

Im using this App for 2 years now, and besides a ton of things i dont realize, i really struggle to bring some air-moving Power to Kicks and Baselines (And Synth Cords). 

It allways sounds okish with headphones at the right volume, but as sonn as i play it on bigger Speakers, it just seems so dull and without the needed Power. 

I know that Auys has its limitation there, but i got some improvements by stacking multiple Kicks and, for example, the low Ends of the Paw Synt, together.

That made me wonder, if there are more possibilities, esspecially for bringing more Power to Synth Cords (My Example was just for Kicks)

If you need an example, the best i could do is the Part that starts at 2:20:

I would love to hear if you also struggle with the lack of raw Power! ;)</description>

<p>i dont have Diva because i dont have $200 to spend, BUT i do have the Tyrell n6 and you can see the memory usage drop by like half every time i close a project with the synth XD</p>

            <p>hey guys thanks for all your replies!</p>
<p>@ <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TheRealJFalc">TheRealJFalc</a></p>
<p>I think its a thin line between being approachable and still have a lot of features.<br>
The only reason i ever got a track done has been the limitations of Auxy. I spent 20 hours creating sounds in Garageband, but never got something done with it.</p>
<p>@<a href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/INDIR3CT">INDIR3CT</a></p>
<p>Good Job! Thats what im talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Db909">Db909</a></p>
<p>It depends, im using beyerdynamic dt 880’s at home and Bose QC35 on the way. For bigger Speakers, i have some Sonos Plays from 1 to 5 and an Arcam FMJ A19 + two KEF LS50.</p>
<p>I can use those two as hairdryer with <a href="https://youtu.be/OlLC6Xwgikc?t=5m40s" rel="nofollow noopener">Bodzin’s Synth’s</a></p>
<p>The only Synth i’ve experienced with so much Power “out of the Box”, is u-he’s Diva in Ableton, but it eat’s your CPU alive <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=6" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Now before you go cutting all the warmth out of your track haphazardly with high pass filters, let me ask you this?  Do you produce on good headphones?  Because if your headphones boost the bass, then you are basically always having the low end at a lower volume that it actually should be due to your headphones making it seem louder than it is.  Which would lead to the phenomenon you describe.</p>
<p>If that’s not a factor,  I would try some simple level readjustments of the different instruments first.  Auxy already has multi band compression happening under the hood to make things punchy so you may just need to turn things up and/or down.  If that fails, yeah, filter the hell out of everything or do a better arrangement.</p>

            <p>I definitely don’t like using Auxys sounds by themselves, to bring out the sounds I need, I layer stuff like crazy.</p>
<p>For example, in my most recent track <a href="https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/restart" rel="nofollow noopener">Restart</a> , for the bassline, I layered a few sub basses. I had one bass with minimum low pass for the low, punchy part of the bass. Then I put another bass that I had with the high pass up 1/4 of the way just to create a heavy sound, it didn’t have much “umph” to it, it just sounded cool! Combing those two layers helped me get a heavier bass.<br>
Same thing with chords… layering <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>But yes, adding a bit of highpass can help drastically.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for the feedback!</p>
<p>So EQ the low end inside Auxy means basically to use a little highpass on everything that isnt specifically meant for the lowends ?</p>
<p>EQing the whole Export would probably be the best thing, but what i love about Auxy is to have an App to use from Start to Finish.</p>

            <p>Layering subs is not a good idea because it might cause phasing issues (the volume cuts off when the frequencies interfere). Just use Lake on the lowest octave for the lowest sub that will shake your house, and layer it with a gently (one tick) lowcut bass with higher frequencies so that cheaper headphones can hear it and expensive headphones can feel it.</p>

            <p>EQ the low end out of everything, duck aggresively, create strong grooves, and use good samples.</p>

            <p>The best way to do this inside the app would be to use some highpass on your chords so they don’t interfere with the kick. That will help bring out the kick’s frequencies, allowing it to punch more.</p>
<p>If you’re exporting from Auxy, you can just do this with EQ in another program to make sure they come out.</p>
