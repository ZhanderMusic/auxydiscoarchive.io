    <description>I’m going to get lots of Auxy stuff into a story I say. So…



There once was a bee that always had stress on its 
mind because the flamingo always bossed them around. The bee had a dream where it had no stress, they were the boss. In real life, when the bee tried to be the the boss, the flamingo would just whinge. One night, the bee went out to a restaurant that served kale and carrot humus. The bee thought it would be horrible, like it would taste like grit. But it didn’t, it tasted good, the bee&#39;s guts agreed. She went back home, the flamingo was sleeping. But suddenly, knock knock. Something burst through the door, holding a bomb. An intruder! The bee realised it was their enemy, the tiger. The bee remembered it had a puff of pepper spray in their pocket she used that on the tiger, which then meant the tiger went into a spiral and fell over.
The end.

I hope this story was funny and gave you all *good vibes*
