    <title>Domination - Tropical Original</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/domination-tropical-original/11451</link>
    <description>Hello my fellow comrades, today i have a new track! Ive had this track for a month and did nothing with it till now, and it sounds amazing from my prospective! What do you guys think? I would love the comments to see what you all think. 

If anyone would like to make special art for this song go ahead! Full credit goe&#39;s to whoever makes the picture. Ill put it in Soundcloud Description.

This song is Hard Bass / Techno. I&#39;d recommend some headphones or a sub woofer to hear the epic bass! ;)

 Soundcloud: [Domination - Tropical Original](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/domination-tropical-original)

Ill be taking long brakes from song making to think of some new sounds and other stuff... 

But in the mean time, You all have a wonderful day!</description>
