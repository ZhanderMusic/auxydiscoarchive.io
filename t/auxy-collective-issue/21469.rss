    <title>Auxy Collective Issue</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-collective-issue/21469</link>
    <description>Hi fellow Auxy friends! A while back I was banned from Auxy Collective because I was typing in caps and spamming a little. But when that happened I was pretty new to discord and I did not really read rules or understand discord common sense. But now iv changed and iv reached out to admins and no one seems to see my messages! I really hope someone finds this and can maybe help me out? Thanks!</description>
