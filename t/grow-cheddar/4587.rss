    <title>Grow - Cheddar</title>

    <description>https://soundcloud.com/cheddr/grow

I made this one months ago, but just now decided to post it. I always planned on adding to it or changing it as my skills got better. 

But at this point i’ve Listened to it so many times that I can’t imagine it any other way.

Contains long phrase melodies, plucky bass, classic chord progresssions. Themes of how things in nature grow and evolve. Sometimes dramatically and powerfully. Sometime slowly but noticable over time.

Now that I think about it I probably shouldn’t have started out so strong with that title.</description>
