    <title>Sideways With Lada (Bass Boosted) - LilBoi</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/sideways-with-lada-bass-boosted-lilboi/17121</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a little bit of &quot;slavaboo&quot; myself and wanted to make some kind of hard bass trap type thing and ended up with this. I might have broken my headphones but I think this turned out pretty good. Remember when its hardbass it is HARDBASS and the only version that I made is bass boosted because it can&#39;t be anything else.
