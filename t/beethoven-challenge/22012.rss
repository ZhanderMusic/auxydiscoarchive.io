    <title>Beethoven Challenge!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/beethoven-challenge/22012</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Haven’t seen a contest posted in a while so here’s a simple idea. Make a song without it vet hearing it.

Rules:

- you are only allowed to hear it after you have posted it to the thread
- no imported drum loops or melodic loops are allowed (Imported one shots like drum one shots and melodic tones are allowed)
- you are not allowed to copy loops and Melodies from other projects 
- don’t cheat! It ruins it for everyone 

I know everyone is thinking that there is a big flaw with this contest which is that people can easily cheat, which they can, but guys please don’t because it ruins it for everyone.

Have fun!</description>
