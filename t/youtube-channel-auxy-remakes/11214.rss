    <title>YouTube channel - Auxy remakes</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/youtube-channel-auxy-remakes/11214</link>
    <description>So I have this idea of creating a channel similar to those channels that share FL studio remakes of songs but specifically for Auxy.  I think it would be a great way to show off the talent of this community!  I would also like to manage this with other members so if anyone is interested in working with me on this please let me know!</description>

<p>It’s interesting. It depends on who’s creating the ‘music video’ – i.e. whether the Auxy cover artist is providing the channel with a readymade video containing the Auxy cover, or they’re providing the channel owner with just the music and the channel owner is adding imagery to it.</p>

<p>From what he said, I got the impression that he would be creating the “music video”, although it’s also not improbable that he’s provided with a fully uploadable video, in which case (NightOwl) you would not need to pay royalties (in this regard, assuming your rights to upload the cover in the first place are all taken care of <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">).</p>

<p>An option to consider might be a visualizer that (NightOwl) you can devise and render yourself to avoid complications with imagery as your visuals. It can also have a very nice effect in tandem with your audio depending on the genre.</p>

<p>Anyway, these are the subtleties you need to consider if (NightOwl) you want to make this happen. Definitely doable, just know what you’re getting yourself into.</p>

<p>It’s interesting. It depends on who’s creating the ‘music video’ – i.e. whether the Auxy cover artist is providing the channel with a readymade video containing the Auxy cover, or they’re providing the channel owner with just the music and the channel owner is adding imagery to it.</p>
<p>The one who adds imagery/video is the one who should be getting the synch licensing.</p>
<p>If the Auxy artist is providing the video file, the only royalties the channel owner would need to worry about are those owed to the Auxy cover artist, as they’re merely reposting a new original synched recording. However, we’d assume that the Auxy cover artist would waive those royalties due from the channel owner.</p>
<p>(Of course, one option would be for the Auxy cover artist to register their creation with the Content ID system, so that any revenue generated on YT from that music video would be redirected back to themselves.)</p>
<p>The Auxy cover artist would be the ones who need to worry about royalties owed to the original publisher.<br>
If they’re also creating the video file (with still/moving imagery) they’d need to take care of the synch licensing too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Although, as mentioned in the CDBaby FAQ article, many don’t which is why the Content ID system and automated claims on monetisation are typically used to handle things on YT now.</p>
<p>Note: Content ID is based on recordings, not published words and music, per se.<br>
but, if a cover is very close to the original recording, it’s possible that it could be incorrectly identified as that original recording and an automated claim issued.</p>
<p>It’s complex and messy, for sure. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Distrokid also makes releasing covers relatively painless – as well as submission to YT’s Content ID system c/o their ‘YouTube Money’ option.</p>
<p>(I have a 3-artist plan with Distrokid, but I’m curious to try releasing under some of the others too including Landr and Amuse.)</p>

<p>Hmm… it did strike me that the latter is what he was considering rather than a purely reposting channel, hence the basis that he would be the one paying the royalties for each cover.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For sure, but as mentioned, even publicly posting on SC or YT (and possibly even here, as it’s a public forum) qualifies as a commercial release, as the Auxy artist is potentially able to benefit commercially, either directly from monetisation, or indirectly, by advertising the (Auxy) artist.</p>
<p>Whether or not the (Auxy) cover is likely to actually generate revenue has no bearing on its classification as a commercial release.</p>

<p>It would be for the Auxy artist themselves to pay the royalties, not <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/nightowl">@NightOwl</a> as the reposting channel owner.<br>
(Unless NightOwl is considering a label/releasing agent/distributor arrangement, which is unlikely.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
All that said, the CDBaby/DIY Musician post linked earlier does a fairly good job of explaining what would actually happen for cover versions released without royalties – i.e. YT’s Content ID algo might identify it, and the publisher would automatically take any monetisation.<br>
(Check out the section on ‘Synch licensing’.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
One thing I’m not clear about is what happens when YT’s Content ID algo identifies a cover track that <em>does</em> have a synch license and royalties paid up.<br>
In those situations, the publisher wouldn’t have the right to take the monetisation. I would assume the cover artist would need to counter-claim and show that they’ve got those things sorted.</p>

<p>As I understand it, it’s more common for publishers* to give carte blanche permission to create cover versions.<br>
i.e. they give broad, open permission. You just need to pay the royalties.</p>
<p>These days, you don’t typically need to contact the publisher. Just register your cover version, pay the royalty fees (see above) and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>It’s uncommon for publishers to block a cover artist.</p>
<p>(* it’s the publishers who own the rights, though they are sometimes also the recording/release artist, but not always.)</p>

<p>True. However, for such a small project operating in a tightly knit community, I assume he doesn’t think it’s worth it to pay royalties in which case you can obtain explicit clearance from the original producer to cover it without the need of royalties.</p>

            <p>I see that now… I once heard that there’s no issues with covers as long as you don’t use any parts from the original track and everything in the song was recorded by you but there’s clearly a lot more to it than that</p>

            <p>Posting it anywhere that’s open to the public will constitute ‘publishing’ (also ‘releasing’), including SoundCloud and, I would assume, this forum too.</p>

            <p>I think the question is…</p>
<p>Are you and those who want to have their covers/remakes posted prepared to pay the royalties?</p>
<p>It’s not huge sums - e.g. Distrokid costs it at ~$12 per cover per year.<br>
But still, many here can’t/won’t pay for something like Soundcloud Pro account, so I’m not sure how many will offer up covers for the channel.</p>

</aside>
<p>As I understand it, it’s more common for publishers* to give carte blanche permission to create cover versions.<br>
i.e. they give broad, open permission. You just need to pay the royalties.</p>
<p>These days, you don’t typically need to contact the publisher. Just register your cover version, pay the royalty fees (see above) and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>It’s uncommon for publishers to block a cover artist.</p>
<p>(* it’s the publishers who own the rights, though they are sometimes also the recording/release artist, but not always.)</p>

            <p>That is true but we wouldn’t be posting remixes just covers which are 100% allowed.  And to be safe there are websites you can go to to get proper licensing for covers.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> pretty much said exactly what I was going to.</p>
<p>A lot of people don’t allow remixes of their songs, and regardless of whether or not it’s licensed properly they wouldn’t be happy about someone covering their song and separately distributing it.</p>
<p>Obtaining permission for every Auxy track that you showcase would be rather tedious and not even close to guaranteed, especially for the purpose which you have described.</p>
<p>If you’re going to stay super small with this channel you probably can get away without obtaining permission, but that’d kind of defeat the purpose of what I imagine you hope to achieve with this, in which case you would need to pay some royalties to the original artist in some shape or form.</p>

            <p>What about publishing rights?<br>
Technically, they’d be cover versions, so you’d need to pay royalties, if you wanted to keep it legit.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The reason the tutorials vids recreating existing commercial tracks won’t need to pay royalties is because they fall under the Fair Use exemption of ‘educational purposes’.</p>

            <p>I do understand that a lot of people post tutorials but that isn’t really the purpose of this.  This is more of a YouTube channel specifically to upload remakes of songs by people from the Auxy community and to showcase their talent through that</p>

            <p>So I have this idea of creating a channel similar to those channels that share FL studio remakes of songs but specifically for Auxy.  I think it would be a great way to show off the talent of this community!  I would also like to manage this with other members so if anyone is interested in working with me on this please let me know!</p>
