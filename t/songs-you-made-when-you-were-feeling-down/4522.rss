    <description>So they don’t have to be sad songs, just something you made when you were feeling down.

I’m interested to see whether they’re happy or moody or if you just keep to a consistent style. 

So yeah, throw your links down below. Old stuff, new stuff, it’s all gooood.</description>

            <p>For me it’s definitely <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dontpartywithguns/dpwg-whoosis">whoosis.</a><br>
I didn’t have school because of a severe storm and I was overall not in a good mood.</p>
<p>Also I put a flanger effect on a hi-hat rythym, am I cool yet?</p>

            <p>Erm, probably <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lagrangain/nervous-sheep-remixdysphoria">this song</a> for right now. I have something related to this feeling coming out after I figure out how to produce vocals. <strike>honestly I’m super emo because most of my music deals with personal stuff life self exploration and self acceptance</strike></p>
