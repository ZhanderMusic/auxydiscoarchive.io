    <title>Frustrating Follower/Play Ratio</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/frustrating-follower-play-ratio/7636</link>
    <description>I&#39;m gonna start this off by saying that I&#39;m not trying to complain.  I&#39;m just kinda confused.

Not that long ago, I had about 5 (real, not bot) followers.  Now, two months later, I&#39;m knocking on the door of 50 followers.  Watching my account grow has been super encouraging and exciting, but I still can&#39;t explain this...

![02%20AM|343x396](upload://umsO8F75DDlBFga1jtqOkwqcCi7.png)
https://soundcloud.com/ballistikbeats

Why so few plays?  
This is especially frustrating since I&#39;ve seen accounts with half as many followers, that have 3-4 times as many plays. 
Is it because I&#39;ve only uploaded nine tracks?  Or is it because I haven&#39;t collabbed with any &quot;big&quot; Auxy artists?  Or maybe, my music really just isn&#39;t good enough to warrant more than 200 plays?  I honestly don&#39;t know.  

Additionally, when I released [Adrenaline](https://soundcloud.com/ballistikbeats/adrenaline) and [Miami Tides](https://soundcloud.com/ballistikbeats/miami-tides), I got plenty of comments/likes right away, as well as a repost or two.  However, my most recent song, [Ethereality](https://soundcloud.com/ballistikbeats/ethereality), has been up for two weeks and still hasn&#39;t gotten to 30 plays yet.  I&#39;m willing to chalk this up to it just not being as good as my other songs, but...I don&#39;t know.  

Does anyone (especially somoene who has listened to/follows me) have a theory on why this is the case?  Is there something missing from my music, that it needs to get to the next level?  Do I need that invaluable &quot;Official Auxy Repost?&quot;  Or do I just need to do a bit more &quot;shameless self-advertising?&quot; (best name ever lol)

A lot of people stress about low numbers of followers; honestly, I&#39;m not super concerned about that.  Plays are way more important, as they show how well your music is accomplishing its job: creating emotion in others. 

Please help me out here, as I&#39;m not surer why this is the case, or what I should do.

Sorry for making myself sound like an insecure 5th grader :joy:

<p>I’d strongly disagree with the first part – and strongly agree with the second part.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone without a broad audience, plays tend to peak briefly after a release or a new mention, but then quickly taper off again.</p>
<p>This creates the urge to release frequently, but this isn’t a good plan, as it will simply devalue each previous track. It pushes you towards a ‘quantity over quality’ process – and tracks created in the mode are less likely to gain individual traction – and break out of the Auxy community, which is what we should all be aiming for.</p>
<p>Find a way to build an audience that goes beyond the Auxy community, as this should help stabilise listen rates and give each track a life of its own. (Auxy community listens are quickly exhausted and there’s little real value in Reposts from within the community as they’re all kinda aiming at each other.)</p>
<p>And, of course, put the time and effort required into making tracks that have greater potential and staying power.</p>

            <p>I believe you’re overthinking it, I agree with Cornea. Don’t worry about it - there’s been times I’ve uploaded stuff and it gets plays like crazy, then sometimes I upload something and it gets nothing or very little traction. You have to consider things like timing, people aren’t always going to listen to something you upload right away, people may not listen at all. It’s not a reflection on you or what you’re doing, it’s just reality.</p>
<p>I would definitely not measure success / self worth based on plays, followers, likes etc.</p>
