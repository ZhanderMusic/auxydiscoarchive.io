**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. The judge this week is @Arimyth    

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p><big> <strong>‚ì¶ho‚Äôs the winner?</strong> </big></p>
<p>The judge this week was <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/arimyth">@Arimyth</a> and he‚Äôs chosen the winner for week 11.</p>
<p>He was pretty torn between AuxySimon and one other entry, but when he searched <a href="https://soundcloud.com/morewaves/dark-ocean" rel="nofollow noopener">AuxySimon‚Äôs track</a> for an error, he couldn‚Äôt find one, so congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/simon2">@simon2</a> for winning his THIRD Track of the Week contest!</p>
<p>And thanks to everyone else who entered.  And to Arimyth for judging.</p>
<p>The winner receives a <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:">  icon next to their forum name. And their name is recorded as a <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961">Track of the Week Winner </a>.</p>
<p>The thread for next weeks competition will be posted soon.</p>
