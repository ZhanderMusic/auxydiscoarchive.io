    <description>This is a thread where everyone will post all of my useless stuff that they can not make a track out of. So the reason they&#39;re posting here is that the tracks need a new home; you! So make any idea in here an awesome track! So... yeah that&#39;s this thread. (Thanks @InfinityBeatz for the inspiration to make his Idea born again, and open to the public.) 

WARNING: You must ask the original artist for permission to upload to SoundCloud. I would PM them to not clutter the thread. 

WARNING: People may plagiarize this thread, so you have to be okay with anybody being able to take your idea.</description>
