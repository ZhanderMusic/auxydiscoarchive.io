            <p>Crazy you say that because I originally had some in there but just before uploading it I decided to turn them off. I’ll put them back in and see if I prefer it that way and maybe I’ll reupload. And yeah I guess it is more future bassy. Thanks fam!</p>

            <p>Not sure about tagging this as synthwave… definitely way more future bass vibe. That said though, I think it’s pretty well put together, it’s got a nice playful vibe. Would have liked to maybe hear some vocal chops, nothing too nuts just a little something. Good job!</p>
