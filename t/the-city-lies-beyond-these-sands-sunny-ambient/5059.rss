    <title>The City Lies Beyond These Sands - Sunny [Ambient]</title>

Made this with a story in mind about a group of desert fighters returning home, and bringing back a long lost princess. Maybe I&#39;ll make the pictures that go with this track one day. 

If I recall, this is the first thing I made with RAC Essentials, which is just a loooovely sound pack. Lake is the shizzle. 

Kept it tight to the chest for a few months hoping to improve the piano that comes in, but no ideas came to mind. Instead I worked to mix this a bit better, mainly with turning the volume down on the drums so it doesn&#39;t overpower the overall ambient vibe.</description>
