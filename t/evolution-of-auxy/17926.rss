    <title>Evolution of Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/evolution-of-auxy/17926</link>
    <description>As you all know that Auxy has stepped up 5th year on 9/12/2019 meaning it’s been 4 years of Auxy since it was launced on 9 Dec 2015. And Since then we saw many new features arrived and many UI designs changed.
So I also guess to celebrate 4th Anniversary of App, Developers @Auxy, @Fredrik relaunched the Classic iPad App as Auxy Jam 
Many new users don’t know where Auxy was and is now.
So I’ll be posting screenshots that will include the changes made in every major version of Auxy.
You can also tell what you liked the most in particular version of App

            <p>Oh yeah, this is the Auxy I remember</p>
<p>What I liked about this version was that it shared the same functionality of the previous Auxy for iPad. It was easy to use at the time and was basic to understand for new users.</p>
<p>The ability to loop a specific section was useful at the time, I don’t recall having to hear the whole loop before the section was played.</p>
