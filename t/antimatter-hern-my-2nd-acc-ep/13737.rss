    <title>Antimatter - Hern (my 2nd acc) [EP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/antimatter-hern-my-2nd-acc-ep/13737</link>
    <description>New EP released under a second account. My goal with this was to make a really nasty sound. I was going for something a little more noisy and industrial on this EP. Link is here:
