            <p>I like the percussion, interesting choices. I’d take it easy on the crash that happens throughout the drum beats in the first minute or so, happening on every measure is a bit much.</p>
<p>I like the sound that comes in at like 1:00, reminds me of a chip synth a bit and fits the overall vibe. I like the groove at 1:30ish, would have liked to hear more of that you filled it in pretty well.</p>
<p>The melodies seem a little lost, a lack of cohesiveness. I think for a first drum and bass effort though you’re at least on the right track, keep working at it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
