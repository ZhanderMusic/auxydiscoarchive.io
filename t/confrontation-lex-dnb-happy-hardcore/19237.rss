            <p>nice.  always like seeing some dnb<br>
def like the hardcore super saw lead.</p>
<p>But i think 2 things feedback wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>there should be more of a break between each of the sections of your tracks.  The drop didnt really have anything leading up to it to build up tension other than a riser right before it.  it’s fine if you dont want to create a section for a full buildup, but you could do something like cut out everything but the melody for like the last 1/2 bar before the drop.  This way the drop hits a lot harder and there’s that transition between the 2 sections.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>example: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/boxplot/thedreamershotel">https://soundcloud.com/boxplot/thedreamershotel</a>(it does have a build up too, but it’s pretty short)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>i also think for dnb/happy hardcore, you could have a stronger bass going on. most of the track feels like mids/highs which is fine for melodic obviously, but i just thought it felt a bit weak.  doesn’t have to be a massive bass, but just give the low end some more presence to round out the overall sound.</li>
</ol>
