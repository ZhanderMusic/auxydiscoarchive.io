            <p>The music in Geometry Dash got me into electronic music as a whole. Before then, I pretty much only listened to what was played on the radio. I was almost convinced that I just hated music lol.</p>

            <p>Shelter (Porter Robinson and Madeon), Sad Machine (Actually just Porter Robinson in general), and some of Snail’s House’s stuff (Specifically Pixel Dream) got me off of my straight 128bpm 4 on the floor dance beat stuff I was writing. I had trouble coming up with different and unique ideas. I’ve been listening to a lot more variety of Ambient and Future Bass-y kind of stuff more recently. I’ve been experimenting with lots of new styles and bpms - I’m just evolving my stuff and finding new things I like/am good at. Not sure about any specific tracks though, but I’ve also been delving into Ambient and Orchestral (I’ve always had a love for the Minecraft soundtrack over the years, so I feel like that might play a role into it.) Pretty much every deadmau5 song is what got me into progressive house and deep house originally.</p>

            <p>Thank you for this thread! The memories… These were iconic for me:</p>
<p>Aftershock by Chuckie got me into House in general</p>
<p>Moombah by Silvio Ecomo &amp; Chuckie got me into Dirty House</p>
<p>One by Swedish House Mafia kind of changed the style of House for me</p>
<p>The World by Hardwell got me into Progressive House</p>

            <p>Coldplay set me up for alternative rock with an orchestra. On the likes of some Muse songs, Woodkid, bit o’ Queen, bit o’ ELO ect ect. Not that I can make it, but I sure like it.</p>
