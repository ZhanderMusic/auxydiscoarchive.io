Balearic beat was named for its popularity among European nightclub and beach rave patrons on the Balearic island of Ibiza, a popular tourist destination. Some dance music compilations referred to it as &quot;the sound of Ibiza,&quot; even though many other, more aggressive and upbeat forms of dance music could be heard on the island.

These samples are often of popular hip hop and contemporary R&amp;B songs or of pop culture references such as themes from television shows.

A subgenre of house music that has had influence from 80&#39;s music. Though its origins are hazy – different sources claim influence from &#39;80s-electro, electroclash, pop, synthpop, or tech house – it has since become a hard form of house music.

**Euro house**
Generally a vocal style of house, Euro house emerged in the late 1980s and was developed in songs which retained a strong influence of dance-pop music, on the background of house music. The History of Euro house is related to the other Euro styles.

Funky house as it sounds today first started to develop during the late 1990s. It can again be sub-divided into many other types of house music. French house, Italian house, disco house, Latin house and many other types of house have all contributed greatly to what is today known as funky house. It is recognizable by its often very catchy bassline, swooshes, swirls and other synthesized sounds which give the music a bouncy tempo. It often relies heavily on black female vocals or disco samples and has a recognizable tiered structure in which every track has more than one build-up which usually reaches a climax before the process is repeated with the next track.

**Garage house**
One of the first house genres with origins set in New York and New Jersey. Garage house developed alongside Chicago house and the result was house music sharing its similarities, influencing each other. Garage house is generally piano oriented, a sound deriving from soul and disco, with a heavy emphasis on vocals, preferably female. One contrast from Chicago house was that the vocals in garage house drew stronger influences from gospel. Notable examples include Adeva and Tony Humphries. Kristine W is an example of a musician involved with garage house outside the genre&#39;s origin of birth.

&gt; **Hard house** Bassment_Chemists 
A style of house music dating back to the early &#39;90s, hard house is defined by its aggressive sounds and distorted beats. One of the most recognizable of these is the Hoover sound, invented by Joey Beltram and recently re-popularized by DJs like Surkin or Bobmo leading to a small hard house revival. One of the most popular hard house tracks is Felix - &quot;Don&#39;t You Want Me&quot;, from 1992.

**Italo house**
Slick production techniques, catchy melodies, rousing piano lines and American vocal styling typifies the Italian (&quot;Italo&quot;) house sound. A modulating Giorgio Moroder style bassline is also characteristic of this style.

**Jazz house**
Larry Heard mixed house with jazz.

**Juke house**
Juke house or Chicago juke characteristically uses beat-skipping kick drums, pounding rapidly (and at times very sparsely) in syncopation with crackling snares, claps, and other sounds reminiscent of old drum machines.

**Kwaito**
Kwaito is a music genre that emerged in Johannesburg, South Africa, during the 1990s. It is a variant of house music featuring the use of African sounds and samples.

**Latin house**
Borrows heavily from Latin dance music such as salsa, Brazilian beats, Latin jazz etc. It is most popular on the East Coast of the United States, especially in Miami and the New York City metropolitan area. Another variant of Latin house, which began in the mid-1990s, was derived in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and is based on more Mexican-centric styles of music such as Mariachi. Artists include Proyecto Uno (best known for &quot;El tiburón&quot;), Artie The One Man Party (best known for &quot;A Mover La Colita&quot;), and DJ EFX (best known for his remix of &quot;Volver Volver&quot;).

**Madchester**

&gt;**Moombahton** - CRASH
Fusion of Dutch house and reggaeton at 108–112 BPM, largely coined by Dave Nada and Dillon Francis.

**New beat**
A rather brief phenomenon (even for the style-a-minute world of dance music), New Beat emerged late in the 1980s as a midtempo derivation of acid house.[3]

**Nu-NRG**
By 1996–97, there was a steady flow of UK based hard house that threw away the fun &amp; uplifting parts to incorporate the &quot;Hoover&quot; &amp; other gritty, menacing sounding elements at a slightly higher tempo than the conventional hard house and thus, the style effectively became known as &quot;Nu-NRG&quot; when Blu Peter coined the phrase in a magazine interview.

&gt;**Progressive house** - Viiitality, [Voltt](https://soundcloud.com/volttmusic/waves), DJ La Rocca, [stereofield](https://soundcloud.com/chipthrasher/house), [TheRealJFalc](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/blip)
Progressive house is typified by accelerating peaks and troughs throughout a track&#39;s duration and are, in general, less obvious than in hard house. Layering different sounds on top of each other and slowly bringing them in and out of the mix is a key idea behind the progressive movement. It is often related to trance music.

&gt;**Swing house** TheRealJFalc - https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/electricity
Swing house or electro swing is a genre of electronic dance music that fuses 1920s–1940s jazz styles including swing music and big band with 2000s styles including house, electro, hip hop, drum &amp; bass and dubstep.

&gt;**Tribal house** - Shephe
Popularized by remixer/DJ Steve Lawler in UK, and Junior Vasquez in New York, it is characterized by lots of percussion and world music rhythms.

&gt;**Tropical house** SpaghettiSauce
Tropical house, often abbreviated as trop house, is a fairly new house music subgenre. It is pioneered by the Australian DJ and producer Thomas Jack. The name of the genre itself started off as a kind of a joke, but has since been gaining popularity among listeners. It is characterized by a summer feeling, incorporating instruments such as saxophones, steel drums, electro synths, and marimbas. The vibe is generally lighter and more relaxed compared to other genres such as deep house. Artists commonly described as fitting the genre include Kygo, Klangkarussell, Klingande, Matoma, Robin Schulz, Felix Jaehn, Sam Feldt, and Lost Frequencies.

&gt;**Witch House** - DHO - [https://soundcloud.com/dhomusic/yoitishousetime](https://soundcloud.com/dhomusic/yoitishousetime)
Witch house (also known as drag or haunted house) is an occult-themed dark electronic music microgenre and visual aesthetic that emerged in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</description>

<p>All joking aside, I’m sure it’ll hopefully appear in some form on the feed. After all, the Easter contest did make its way on there, even if it was only the winners and not the runner-ups as well. The feed’s been a bit dusty for over a month now, and last time anything was there that wasn’t sound related was very long ago.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a> did you order tracks based on the style? Or the date they were completed? Or was there some other method to ordering the songs in the playlist? I’m just curious as they seem a bit random at first glance.</p>
