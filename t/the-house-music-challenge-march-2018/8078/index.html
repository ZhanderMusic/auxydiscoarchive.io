It is recognizable by its often very catchy bassline, swooshes, swirls and other synthesized sounds which give the music a bouncy tempo.

One of the most recognizable of these is the Hoover sound, invented by Joey Beltram and recently re-popularized by DJs like Surkin or Bobmo leading to a small hard house revival.

<p><strong>Nu-NRG</strong><br/>
By 1996–97, there was a steady flow of UK based hard house that threw away the fun &amp; uplifting parts to incorporate the “Hoover” &amp; other gritty, menacing sounding elements at a slightly higher tempo than the conventional hard house and thus, the style effectively became known as “Nu-NRG” when Blu Peter coined the phrase in a magazine interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Progressive house</strong> - Viiitality, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/volttmusic/waves">Voltt</a>, DJ La Rocca, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chipthrasher/house">stereofield</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/blip">TheRealJFalc</a><br/>
Progressive house is typified by accelerating peaks and troughs throughout a track’s duration and are, in general, less obvious than in hard house. Layering different sounds on top of each other and slowly bringing them in and out of the mix is a key idea behind the progressive movement. It is often related to trance music.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tropical house</strong> SpaghettiSauce<br/>
Tropical house, often abbreviated as trop house, is a fairly new house music subgenre. It is pioneered by the Australian DJ and producer Thomas Jack. The name of the genre itself started off as a kind of a joke, but has since been gaining popularity among listeners. It is characterized by a summer feeling, incorporating instruments such as saxophones, steel drums, electro synths, and marimbas. The vibe is generally lighter and more relaxed compared to other genres such as deep house. Artists commonly described as fitting the genre include Kygo, Klangkarussell, Klingande, Matoma, Robin Schulz, Felix Jaehn, Sam Feldt, and Lost Frequencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve got nine participants so far.  I’m already excited about hearing these house tracks &amp; getting more familiar with the sub-genres.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dream house Produk</strong> - Never heard of Dream House! No idea what to expect. Cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>French house - nrgb</strong> - Didn’t think anyone would pick this. Niiiice one -  “Ce vin a un goût d’urine”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funky house tornait</strong> -  Yep, you’ve definitely got enough funk to tackle this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimal house - Mister Master</strong> - My tracks sound better the less there is of them!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moombahton iaatoe</strong> -  Reggae time baby!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Progressive house - Viiitality</strong> - This has been talked about recently on the forum, with people having different views about what “progressive” means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Swing house TheRealJFalc</strong> - Almost took this one myself.  Was going to listen to swing music on spotify for a while for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech house Nick Elle (Nick Lecroix)</strong> - Injecting techo into house? Probably a balancing act, to ensure it doesn’t become pure techno.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tropical house SpaghettiSauce</strong> - Tropical Sauce? LOL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone else wanna join? Add your name at the top. Would love to see <a class="mention" href="../../../u/dj_la_rocca.html">@DJ_La_Rocca</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="../../../u/TC64.html">@TC64</a> jump in.</p>
