            <p>Thanks for being the first forum member of the week  <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sufos">@SUFOS</a>.  I think a few people discovered your music for the first time, which is exactly why we’re doing this. You were a good person to start this off with.</p>
<p>And thanks to everyone who provided feedback this week. If you missed out on listening to SUFOS’s music, it’s not too late to check it out and leave some feedback.</p>

            <p>I genuinely regret not listening to your music before now <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sufos">@SUFOS</a>. This stuff is absolutely fantastic. It’s highly creative and experimental and uses a lot of things people would find unpopular but does it in such a way that’s freaking amazing and genius. Keep making amazing music my dude.</p>

            <p>I just realized I don’t think I left feedback. My favorite song is firebird. It’s on my playlist now, very nice work overall. Can’t wait to hear what you’ve got in 2018! I’ll be following.</p>

            <p>What a nice user selection to start this weekly feedback thread.</p>
<p>Overall, I like your style of composing.<br>
As I left some comment in SC, I like some chord you made, and cool pitch bending. you are also good at making chill drops. nice work <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If I could give an advice, it would be probably about melody line.<br>
The melodies are a little bit too repetitive in your track. I guess.<br>
Maybe, these would help you to avoid repetitiveness</p>
<ul>
<li>Change pitch from middle or last part of the track (so you can make a climax in a melody while avoiding repetitiveness)</li>
<li>Try multiple main melody lines. if you make 2 main melodies in general, make it 3. if it’s 3, make it 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look forward to your next one!</p>
