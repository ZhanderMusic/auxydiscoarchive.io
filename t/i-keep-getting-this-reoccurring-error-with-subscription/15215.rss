    <title>I keep getting this reoccurring error with subscription</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-keep-getting-this-reoccurring-error-with-subscription/15215</link>
    <description>I keep getting this error once every month when my subscription renews, it says I don’t have it when I obviously do. Sometimes this fixes itself over time, sometimes I have to cancel the subscription and sub to get the sounds. All and all, it’s really annoying. If this could be your main priority first that would be amazing! :)</description>
