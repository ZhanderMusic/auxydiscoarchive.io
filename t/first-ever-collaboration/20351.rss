    <title>First Ever Collaboration!</title>

    <description>While I no longer use the $L@$H moniker on SoundCloud (I now go by STEREOFYLDZ), I do still produce tracks with Auxy, and I’ve been teaching my twin sister, Makayla, (Noodles) how to produce tracks. She is actually more talented at producing drops than I’d thought, and we ended up sharing this track. I highly enjoyed collaborating with her on the track, and I hope you enjoy it too.
