            <p>Brief note. Earlier, I recommended checking out LevelMusic as a distribution option.</p>
<p>My advice now isâ€¦ I donâ€™t recommend them.</p>
<p>I signed up for their Premium plan and had an initially smooth release for two Black Node tracks (jazz) and one Humankin track (electronic).</p>
<p>When I attempted to release two additional Black Node tracks, things started going south.</p>
<p>Long story short, theyâ€™ve screwed up all the Black Node existing and new releases â€” and their support has been very poor, not really paying attention to the problems Iâ€™m describing, and saying theyâ€™ll fix things, but then not fixing things.</p>
<p>The problems stem from using the Jazz genre, which they offered/listed as an option in their releases tools, but theyâ€™ve recently â€˜discoveredâ€™ (after being in business for over a year) that they canâ€™t offer Jazz.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re not using Jazz (or Classical or Film Score), then theyâ€™re probably ok.<br>
(I have one electronic release with them, which they havenâ€™t screwed up soâ€¦ <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
<p>Either way, Iâ€™m going to move my LevelMusic releases somewhere else and close that account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Very disappointing.</p>

            <p>btw, if graphic design isnâ€™t your thing, then Iâ€™m happy to help you put some simple cover art together, if it means this gets pushed out further sooner <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Side-note: Just noticed that youâ€™re aware of Caribou/Daphni on SC.<br>
Explains the influence in this track. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Not meant as a criticism. I love his sound(s) too, starting back in his early <em>Manitoba</em> days.</p>
<p>More than happy to see these sounds popping up in this forum.</p>

            <p>Thatâ€™s cool. Itâ€™s a great track.<br>
So, please, make it public so more ears can hear it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Oh, and when you do make it public, be sure to submit it to the current weekâ€™s Auxy Forum <em>Track of the Week</em>. (The threadâ€™s not up yet, but keep an eye out for it in the <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/c/contests/10">Contest &amp; Challenges</a> category).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
If the track is locked (i.e. no more changes planned), get it up on Spotify, Pandora, etcâ€¦</p>
<p>If youâ€™re not already hooked up for digital distribution, you might wanna check out a couple of the decent free distribution services, including <a href="http://Amuse.io">Amuse.io</a> <s>and <a href="http://LevelMusic.com">LevelMusic.com</a></s>. (<a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/7you8-made-on-my-phone/20216/9">see below</a>)</p>

            <p>Woahâ€¦to be honest, I donâ€™t know what to answer to this review.  This is generally the first response to my music.  All I can say is that such reviews motivate you to do what you do <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Thank you for not passing by and expressing your opinion <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>I think itâ€™s a great track. Make it public. Now! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
(and get some proper tags in.)</p>
<p>I wanted to like it and make a couple of comments, but couldnâ€™t bc itâ€™s Privated.</p>
<p>(Iâ€™d also consider renaming it. Itâ€™s cute, but I think it might limit its appeal. Something to consider, maybe. Maybe some â€˜properâ€™ artwork too.)</p>
<p>From the great vibe of the opening sequence, I was expecting (kinda hoping) it would turn into a kinda of Caribou/Daphni style track. It kinda did and didnâ€™t.</p>
<p>When the first build started, especially using the riser and 909(?) snares, I was expecting (and hoping against) it to turn into some kind of big-room banger â€” but Iâ€™m glad it didnâ€™t.</p>
<p>You kept it fairly stripped back and I like where you took it.</p>
<p>It all felt very pro. Great head music, but still danceable.<br>
Subtle and sophisticated. Confident in knowing how to create a great track with only a few moving parts.</p>
<p>Definite potential for traction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
A few specific commentsâ€¦</p>
<p>[Edit] Actually, no, it would be nit-picking. Itâ€™s a great piece.</p>
<p>Maybe the only â€˜changeâ€™ I might propose would be to add a nice little lo-fi, crunchy organic percussion pattern under the drums. Just to dirty it up a little and add a little character and colour.</p>
<p>But, as said, maybe thatâ€™s just nit-picking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
So, give it a decent name, sort out the main genre and genre/influences tags, make it public for g*dâ€™s sake! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>â€¦not least so I can comment, Like and Repost it.<br>
(I followed you straight away on hearing this track. Just going through your past stuff. Clearly very talented and capable. Criminally low play numbers on these older tracks.)</p>
<p>You definitely need to sort out your promo game. The tracks are certainly good enough to get some traction with the right push.</p>
<p>Of course, get it up on Spotify, etcâ€¦, if they arenâ€™t already.<br>
Then get your social promo game on. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
