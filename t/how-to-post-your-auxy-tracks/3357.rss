    <title>How to post your Auxy Tracks?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-post-your-auxy-tracks/3357</link>
    <description>
To ensure your Auxy tracks are visible and easy to browse, here&#39;s some guidelines for posting your Auxy tracks.

### How to Post Your Auxy Tracks

1. Post your **completed track** in the #tracks category OR, click [here](https://disco.auxy.co/new-topic?title=TrackName%20-%20By%20Artist&amp;body=Paste%20your%20URL%20here&amp;category_id=7)  
One thread per track, LP or album.  

2. Post your **Work In Progress tracks** in the #WIP category OR, click [here](https://disco.auxy.co/new-topic?title=TrackName%20-%20By%20Artist&amp;body=Paste%20your%20URL%20here&amp;category_id=16)  
One thread per track, LP or album. 

2. Threads should be named:   **[Track_Name] - [Artist]**
  &gt;        eg:   Sonic Passion  - StinkFace
Tracks without a name can be called:  &quot;Untitled - By XXXXXX&quot; 

Avoid generic titles like: 
&gt; * Here&#39;s my latest track
&gt; * Check this out!!!
&gt; * Feedback wanted...
&gt; * Anyone want to collab? 
&gt; * New 
&gt; * I just made this

### Optional tags
You can optionally add tags to the end of your thread title. The standard TAGS are: 
&gt; **[WIP]** = Work in Progress. Use this for incomplete tracks or concepts. But we don&#39;t post junk or get too spammy with these. 
&gt; **[Remix]** = This track is a remix of another song. Remember to credit the original artist. 
&gt; **[Remixable]** = Invite others to remix your track. 
&gt; **[Collab]** = Seeking someone to collaborate on this track [Collab requests go in WIP category)
&gt; **[Genre]** =  Genre of music eg: [Trap], [House], [Ambient], etc. 
&gt; **[Project]** = Auxy project file is provided within thread. 
&gt; **[Album]** = A full album release. 
&gt; **[Spotify]** = contains a Spotify link
Let&#39;s stick to this small group of tags initially, while people get used to the idea. 

### Examples of good thread titles 

&gt;  Untitled - By StrongAle 
&gt;  Moonbeam - By Muncher [Ambient]
&gt;  Love Time - By CoCo [Project, House, Remixable]
&gt;  Bad - By Michael Jackson [Remix By YungPunk]
&gt;  Untitled - By Pookie [Collab?, Trap, Project]

If you enjoy a track, click the HEART icon under the thread&#39;s first post.  This helps identify the most popular tracks and encourages other producers. 

### Non-Auxy Tracks

            <p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but: for finding newest tracks in the old format, you could tap the scroll bar and instantly go to the most recent, plus, if you’re looking for a specific track, why not just search it up on SoundCloud, plus, it messes up the order of the tracks Everytime there’s a new comment, whereas the old one was linear and the tracks were all in one place. If we’re looking for specific tracks, thats literally what The search bar and artist page on SoundCloud are for. Kinda silly to do it here! If it’s a project, we could make a separate post for people to share those on. If you like a track, like it on SoundCloud. Thats what it’s for and is a lot simpler.</p>

            <p>Yes! We should have a category just for Track Posting, besides the one we have now. Then users can mute it if they wish to.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback aUstin.</p>
<p>It’s funny as my experience is the opposite:</p>
<p><strong>Old way:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find the old massive thread.</li>
<li>Open the thread</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of heaps of posts.</li>
<li>Work out which message I was up to.</li>
<li>Read the messages</li>
<li>Try to make sense of the replies, with people responding to old posts.<br>
End result:  Posted tracks were buried in a thread &amp; hardly being clicked. And people also posted in their own threads anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can see which threads you’ve already read, as the title is gray.</li>
<li>Can see which threads are popular via likes or posts.</li>
<li>Can see  how many views your thread has.</li>
<li>Can easily ignore tracks and replies if you’re not interested based on the heading or artist.</li>
<li>Can read all of the replies about a track easily in one location.</li>
<li>Much easier to locate a specific track</li>
<li>Can bookmark tracks you like.</li>
<li>Can mute the tracks category if you want don’t want any tracks appearing under LATEST.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I just wanted to point out that this new format is kind of inefficient and is seriously cluttered. This topic is also for collab ideas and other posts and with this new “make a new post every time you make a new track” thing it really buries the rest of the topic and makes it inconvenient to someone who wants to go through as many tracks as they can. You have to load separate topics and click on the link, then when you’re finished, you have to go out of that topic and then randomly choose another topic that has a track in it, then click THAT link… See what I mean? I miss having all the tracks in a row and with a set order that doesn’t move back to the top the moment someone gives feedback on it, really pushing it in the opposite direction of what this format was intending to fix. It kind of drives me away from listening to them, personally. Just wanted to bring that to a mod’s attention and really wish it would change back…</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/notmiles">@NotMiles</a>, thanks for being one of the first to use the new naming format.</p>
<p>Interestingly, your latest track <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/catnip-notmiles/3362/9">Catnip</a>, was posted with the new approach and already has more clicks than a song you posted 9 days ago in the old ‘Post Your Track’ thread. That’s a good sign. It will be interesting to see how this works as more tracks are posted.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the new approach is that you can now see how many people viewed that specific song thread, even if they didn’t bother to reply or hit like.  For members who feel their tracks aren’t played much, this lets them see that at least their thread about the track has been viewed by someone.</p>
<p>Your idea about one-thread-per-member was actually one of the considered options.</p>

            <p>I am not a huge fan of this new “one thread per song” format, but if we have to do it this way, I think it would be better if each disco member had their own thread to post all of their new music. That way their music is still visible and easy to browse while reducing the clutter of having a bunch of threads for every song posted.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blakkaz">@blakkaz</a></p>
<p>The approach is based on gaming forums , which manage to list thousands of games using a one-thread per game approach, without getting out of hand. It actually helps the site be easier to browse. Much easier than looking back through one massive thread of links.</p>

            <p>To ensure your Auxy tracks are visible and easy to browse, here’s some guidelines for posting your Auxy tracks.</p>
<h3>How to Post Your Auxy Tracks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Post your <strong>completed track</strong> in the <a class="hashtag" href="https://disco.auxy.co/c/7-tracks">#<span>tracks</span></a> category OR, click <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/new-topic?title=TrackName%20-%20By%20Artist&amp;body=Paste%20your%20URL%20here&amp;category_id=7">here</a><br>
One thread per track, LP or album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post your <strong>Work In Progress tracks</strong> in the <span class="hashtag">#WIP</span> category OR, click <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/new-topic?title=TrackName%20-%20By%20Artist&amp;body=Paste%20your%20URL%20here&amp;category_id=16">here</a><br>
One thread per track, LP or album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threads should be named:   <strong>[Track_Name] - [Artist]</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>   eg:   Sonic Passion  - StinkFace
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tracks without a name can be called:  “Untitled - By XXXXXX”</p>
<p>Avoid generic titles like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Here’s my latest track</li>
<li>Check this out!!!</li>
<li>Feedback wanted…</li>
<li>Anyone want to collab?</li>
<li>New</li>
<li>I just made this</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Optional tags</h3>
<p>You can optionally add tags to the end of your thread title. The standard TAGS are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[WIP]</strong> = Work in Progress. Use this for incomplete tracks or concepts. But we don’t post junk or get too spammy with these.<br>
<strong>[Remix]</strong> = This track is a remix of another song. Remember to credit the original artist.<br>
<strong>[Remixable]</strong> = Invite others to remix your track.<br>
<strong>[Collab]</strong> = Seeking someone to collaborate on this track [Collab requests go in WIP category)<br>
<strong>[Genre]</strong> =  Genre of music eg: [Trap], [House], [Ambient], etc.<br>
<strong>[Project]</strong> = Auxy project file is provided within thread.<br>
<strong>[Album]</strong> = A full album release.<br>
<strong>[Spotify]</strong> = contains a Spotify link<br>
Let’s stick to this small group of tags initially, while people get used to the idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Examples of good thread titles</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Untitled - By StrongAle<br>
Moonbeam - By Muncher [Ambient]<br>
Love Time - By CoCo [Project, House, Remixable]<br>
Bad - By Michael Jackson [Remix By YungPunk]<br>
