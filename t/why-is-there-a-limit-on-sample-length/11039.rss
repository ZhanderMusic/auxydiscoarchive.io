            <p>There is sample length limit in just about every mobile app that allows sample import. It’s a RAM, CPU thing most likely.  Sometimes the developers are able to increase it without causing issues and sometimes they are not.  Kind of the same as when we had 12 tracks, 16 tracks, 24. It will likely increase at some point, but don’t expect a lot</p>

            <p>Pitch it up using audio editing app/software, resave it, then pitch it back down in Auxy.</p>
<p>The limit was presumably added due to performance issues discovered during beta testing that new feature.<br>
A number of members here would like to see the limit increased to something a bit less restrictive.</p>
