    <title>A VERY Bad Case Of The Perfectionisms</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-very-bad-case-of-the-perfectionisms/7775</link>
    <description>Hi all.
I have a BAD case of the perfectionisms. At the moment in Auxy I have about 4 finished songs, for most people my standard GOOD ENOUGH TO RELEASE but not for me. I have been working on Tides, Febrero, Claustrophobia and No.1 (it has no name yet) for over a month at least. One of them for 3 months. I always think to myself &quot;I SHOULD GET THESE PUBLISHED MR MOOO YOU IDIOT JUST PUBLISH THESE [spoiler]and you music is trash[/spoiler]&quot; but I never do. I guess I&#39;m worried that when I upload it I&#39;ll get 50 comments saying &#39;oh this is so bad you could&#39;ve improved this&#39; and &#39;meh it&#39;s ok it would be so much better if you improved this&#39;.

That&#39;s just the finished songs.

I have over 100 songs that I could make into full tracks and I just never do. I just can&#39;t move forward on them until I _perfect_ the beginning of the song. And for me that just never happens.

Please, I repeat, _please_ help me. I haven&#39;t uploaded a normal, non-remix or collab single (Enero doesn&#39;t count because I had a time limit to upload that, end of January) since Invigorate, 2 months ago. This case of the perfectionisms could ruin my Soundcloud. I have had 32 plays in the last week, because I have so little new content.

I need help.

- Mr Mooo :smile: :grin:</description>

            <p>Why not stick them up on SC as Private, stick ‘(Draft)’ in the name and then share them in the WIP category?</p>
<p>The feedback might help you hone in on what’s not quite right, if anything, and break the inner stalemate.</p>

            <p>Do you know specifically what’s missing/not quite right for each track, or is it a general feeling that they’re not ‘ready’ that you’re having trouble shaking off?</p>

Btw, I like the notation in the name. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I’ve had times where I’ve looked back at a song and said to myself “Why did I think this was a good song”.<br>
It’s not the fact that you’re convincing youself that your music is bad, it’s the fact that you’ve improved enough to realise your own mistakes. What that being the case, if you upload a track and realise you could of done more on it, then that means you’ve gotten better at making music in general and for you to make a song completely perfect may not happen because there’s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>I’m just babbling on now, but don’t forget that whatever you do, we’ll be there to support and give feedback on your tracks <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>You gotta remember though: feedback, especially when it’s constructive, is so much more valuable than likes. Wanting to become popular without confidence in your product isn’t going to work. By putting yourself out there, you may cop nasty comments from time to time, but you <em>will</em> also gain a lot more knowledge than just keeping your music unreleased, which will skyrocket your confidence in later musical endeavours. Big names had to start somewhere; they probably released music under aliases such as ours in forums like Disco. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/v.png?v=5" title=":v:" class="emoji" alt=":v:">️</p>

            <p>Hi all.<br>
I have a BAD case of the perfectionisms. At the moment in Auxy I have about 4 finished songs, for most people my standard GOOD ENOUGH TO RELEASE but not for me. I have been working on Tides, Febrero, Claustrophobia and No.1 (it has no name yet) for over a month at least. One of them for 3 months. I always think to myself “I SHOULD GET THESE PUBLISHED MR MOOO YOU IDIOT JUST PUBLISH THESE <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-very-bad-case-of-the-perfectionisms/7775/1">spoiler</a></span>” but I never do. I guess I’m worried that when I upload it I’ll get 50 comments saying ‘oh this is so bad you could’ve improved this’ and ‘meh it’s ok it would be so much better if you improved this’.</p>
<p>That’s just the finished songs.</p>
<p>I have over 100 songs that I could make into full tracks and I just never do. I just can’t move forward on them until I <em>perfect</em> the beginning of the song. And for me that just never happens.</p>
<p>Please, I repeat, <em>please</em> help me. I haven’t uploaded a normal, non-remix or collab single (Enero doesn’t count because I had a time limit to upload that, end of January) since Invigorate, 2 months ago. This case of the perfectionisms could ruin my Soundcloud. I have had 32 plays in the last week, because I have so little new content.</p>
<p>I need help.</p>
