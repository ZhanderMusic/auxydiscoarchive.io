Trying to add something a bit fresh to the Soundcloud. I’m enjoying the hell out of RAC Essentials, and really working to polish a bunch of songs made with it. Been playing with this one for a couple of weeks, and found the motivation to clean it up. 

It’s really nice being able to have a community of users to talk to. Gets your creativity flowing.

Comments and criticism always welcomed.</description>
