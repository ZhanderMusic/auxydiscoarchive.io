            <p>I like it.</p>
<p>It sounds to me as an industrial facility or something like it. I can’t explain it in more detail for now so I hope you get my point <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>When it comes to a vocal, I can think of some strong rap or…Bjork! Don’t laugh, it’s what I thought while I was listening to this track.</p>
<p>It’s also relaxing in a way.</p>

            <p>Thanks, darwinmcd. Appreciated.</p>
<p>Tbh, I’m not happy using Tonsil au naturel, but I allowed myself that one as a placeholder in a demo.</p>
<p>Of course, coming from you, I’d consider any likening to DM as a huge compliment. So, certainly thanks there.</p>
<p>And, yeah, on vocals, I’m torn.</p>

            <p>Great song man!  With the sound design, I felt like I was hearing a lost B-Side from Depeche Mode’s Speak &amp; Spell album (that’s a compliment BTW).  Agree this is primed for vocals but also feel it could work well as an instrumental.</p>

            <p>It’s in the ‘indie synth-pop’ territory in my head, which covers a broad range of sounds, but interested to know what you’d consider it.</p>
<p>If you have a point of reference - a track you think it would fit naturally alongside, sound-wise - would be interested to hear that too.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t call this Pop.<br>
It sounds like I can sing on it (maybe), and I for sure don’t sing Pop.</p>

            <p>Thanks - and thanks also to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/indir3ct">@INDIR3CT</a></p>
<p>I think it needs a bit of attention in the mix as some parts are being overwhelmed, especially later in the track.<br>
Just need to know some bits back a little to make a bit of space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Re: vocals</p>
<p>It has a kinda song structure*, and while I want to finish it as a vocal track, it could possibly stand as a purely instrumental piece.</p>
<p>I’m not actually sure which way to finish it up as a vocal track. I’ll have to give it much more thought. (Got a few pieces in need of lyrics/vocals now.)</p>
<p>* intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus/bridge, chorus, (repeat), outro</p>

            <p>Dannnng. That is awesome. Would love to see what this is like with vocals! This is put together very well regardless…</p>
