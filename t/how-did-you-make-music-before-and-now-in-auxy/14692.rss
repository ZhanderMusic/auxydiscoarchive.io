    <description>How did you create music before, and how do you make music now?

-while creating transitions from builds to drops on the last bar in future bass or trap, I always did a 808 snare sequence similar to the last bar before the drop in “Crimson” by blackocean. But now, I use the melody from a melodic instrument in the last bar before the drop or toms (not the same way as 808 snares before)

-I was also bad at creating drum beats in future bass and trap. For kicks, i always used 1 kick in the 1st beat of the first bar, then in the 2nd bar, it’s the same as the first bar, but a kick has been added halfway through the second beat. I always thought that was the only way to add more variation to my music when @DJ_La_Rocca said that in his future bass tutorial video (he didn’t say where to put the kicks, he just said to add more variation and made the kick part like that) I also thought the only way to add variation to the snare part was on the 1st and 2nd bar, add the snare to the 3rd beat, and on the 2nd bar, place a snare halfway through the first beat, or sometimes also halfway through the fourth beat in the first bar. Now, I rarely put snares halfway through the first beat on the 2nd bar, and don’t use the kick part in Rocca’s future bass drum tutorial drum kit. 

-also before, on my first few weeks of using auxy (i think while the app was in 3.2) I mixed the melody and arp progression in one instrument, but now I rarely do that and only do it in some instances 

Tell me how you guys used to create music, and how you changed and the way you create music now

-when i first used auxy, my brother said changing the tweaks was how to create your own instruments, so i never touched the tweaks in any instrument unless i “wanted to create my own instruments”. later i realized tweaks were for changing the character of the sound.</description>

            <p>I started in and still use Garageband for my tracks, but they used to be pretty bad.  I didn’t really know how to structure tracks and my drops mainly just consisted of stacking more sounds and drums.</p>
<p>Auxy was immensely helpful in making original material, structuring, and overall just learning “how to make things sound good”.  I think Auxy helped me learn these things a lot faster than if i were to just try and do everything on my own.</p>
<p>Again, I still use Garageband, but now i’ve been focusing more on Ableton, but still keeping Auxy as a side project.  My tracks are a lot more fleshed out and are structured much better than before, my sound design has improved (might just be from experience tho), and I know how to make a more powerful buildup</p>

            <p>I originally tried launching straight into Logic Pro X and Ableton. Frankly put, I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t make any original tracks (I couldn’t, because drawing chords and structuring tracks was way too difficult for ten-year-old me.) I resorted to midi, basically, finding midi versions of various video game songs and “remixing” them. This aversion to technicality still exists in some form now. I just wanna be able to be good at automation! Maybe even use my experience in Auxy to make good music with Logic Pro X! I promise, those presets can do good.</p>

            <p>I will say this of GB loops, though (or any) - plop em in, cut them up, and run them through an FX chain and IMO there’s really no harm no foul there…</p>
<p>Loops aren’t inherently bad, it’s all about usage</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/davis9754">@Davis9754</a> question isn’t really about apps or programs (if I’m thinking about your original post contents eh?)</p>
<p>I never thought much about this, good question. I’ve been doing this for awhile, so Auxy hasn’t changed how I write. It took quite a bit of time to wrap my head around Auxy and get <em>my</em> sound out of it (sample import helped a lot here).</p>
<p>As far as what’s changed or evolved, focus on drums and what samples I use has refined over the years. The types of sounds I use have changed (organic over synthetic in most cases), the aggressiveness has been toned down ( started writing music in the style of Nine Inch Nails and slowly, slowly it’s become “elevator music” according to my wife <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=7" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
<p>I can say that programs like Reason, Gadget and Auxy have helped me think about automation in new ways and creative ways to use automation for either synths or samples, so that’s a newer thought process in the last ten years or so.</p>
<p>Good question. Cutting myself off here lol…</p>

            <p>Before Auxy, I wrote sheet music. For real instruments.</p>
<p>No, I’m not joking. I’m 100% serious. I didn’t study a music minor for nothing xD I used a program on iOS called Notion that we got through our class (it’s 15$ otherwise with about 30$ in purchaseable extras because it can’t just include a full set of instruments for 15$ like seriously come on) and I wrote traditional music through it. Auxy revolutionized my way of thinking about music and actually writing music.</p>

            <p>I used to have this program on my computer called “virtual dj” and let me tell you…I made some garage beats <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=7" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> I had no idea what I was doing &amp; wanted to start learning how to make music asap. So that’s when I discovered GarageBand, from then on I made some “ok” beats but it still wasn’t what I was looking for in terms of music. So then on I started experimenting with different music studios apps &amp; came across auxy. At first I was hesitant about it because I knew nothing about making fluent music, but the more I believed in myself &amp; started to actually take my music to the next level (sort of). I was hooked…auxy is a great app</p>

            <p>How did you create music before, and how do you make music now?</p>
<p>-while creating transitions from builds to drops on the last bar in future bass or trap, I always did a 808 snare sequence similar to the last bar before the drop in “Crimson” by blackocean. But now, I use the melody from a melodic instrument in the last bar before the drop or toms (not the same way as 808 snares before)</p>
<p>-I was also bad at creating drum beats in future bass and trap. For kicks, i always used 1 kick in the 1st beat of the first bar, then in the 2nd bar, it’s the same as the first bar, but a kick has been added halfway through the second beat. I always thought that was the only way to add more variation to my music when <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dj_la_rocca">@DJ_La_Rocca</a> said that in his future bass tutorial video (he didn’t say where to put the kicks, he just said to add more variation and made the kick part like that) I also thought the only way to add variation to the snare part was on the 1st and 2nd bar, add the snare to the 3rd beat, and on the 2nd bar, place a snare halfway through the first beat, or sometimes also halfway through the fourth beat in the first bar. Now, I rarely put snares halfway through the first beat on the 2nd bar, and don’t use the kick part in Rocca’s future bass drum tutorial drum kit.</p>
<p>-also before, on my first few weeks of using auxy (i think while the app was in 3.2) I mixed the melody and arp progression in one instrument, but now I rarely do that and only do it in some instances</p>
<p>Tell me how you guys used to create music, and how you changed and the way you create music now</p>
<p>-when i first used auxy, my brother said changing the tweaks was how to create your own instruments, so i never touched the tweaks in any instrument unless i “wanted to create my own instruments”. later i realized tweaks were for changing the character of the sound.</p>
