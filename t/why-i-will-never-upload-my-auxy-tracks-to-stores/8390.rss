    <title>Why I will never upload my Auxy tracks to stores</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/why-i-will-never-upload-my-auxy-tracks-to-stores/8390</link>
    <description>So this is a question I ask myself most of the time. Especially when I see others uploading their tracks to places like iTunes or spotify. I always wonder whether I should or I shouldn’t. My IRL friends think I should and it is tempting to do so. 

I will never upload any Auxy track to Stores, following this: In the future when I am able to afford a real DAW (I hope sooner than later) I will remove every Auxy track I have made from SoundCloud. 
Either this or creating a New Soundcloud to upload Music on. 

The reason for this that Auxy really doesn’t cut it for me, Don’t get me wrong Auxy is the best mobile Music app out there and is great for getting down ideas on the go. I have spent the past 2 to 3 years learning the ins and outs of Sound design and music theory, only to find I can’t do anything yet. 

I don’t want to release something into stores that doesnt refelct my personality. I haven’t yet shown my true self through music because I am limited: I have ideas I cant write down, I have full compositions I cannot express fully. 

And Just having this in my head I know isn’t healthy. Which Is why on my first and last Album release (Auxy made) I will leave Auxy and its community most likely for good. 

Im sorry if I disappoint those who are expecting me to continue using Auxy for ever. I won’t. 

Maybe you can change your mind and tell me what you think of my idea, Is it stupid? 
The next Distress message will be on the 23rd where I will preview the Album for everyone.  

EDIT: Collaborations do not apply to this as I believe it depends on the other person(s)

            <p>Mmmm yeah I don’t think there is any cross talk between hardware and link. That would be pretty wild!</p>
<p>Edit: I bet if you look hard enough though there is some Raspberry Pi based hardware to software converter lol… there’s so many weird Raspberry Pi things out there haha</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure with link there is no concept of master and slave, they act as peers with tempo information. Changing one changes them all, this may or may not be what you want though.</p>
<p>In the current version they don’t share play start/stop information but I think that’s coming next version.</p>

            <p>Let me chime in with another perspective.<br>
I think limitations are a bless.<br>
I used to produce all my music in Ableton, however I felt that with endless tools and VSTs I often got lost and instead of learning I got caught in the details of finding the right sound, tweaking notes endlessly and such.</p>
<p>The real joy came to me when I started using physical instruments, like drum machines, sampler, fx, a mixer, etc.</p>
<p>Auxy has allowed me to quickly sketch melodies on the go. ( Most of my Auxy tracks are done during commute on the subway and yes, I constantly miss my station <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">)<br>
I then may sample phrases or even single shots from Auxy and incorporate them into my live set. Other times I simply re-create a melody I made in Auxy on the sampler or keyboard.</p>
<p>Having a limited palette and hardware memory  has allowed me to focus on composition and live performance and I’ve learned a lot more than years on a DAW.</p>
<p>I now even use Auxy on an iPad along physical instruments and trigger loops manually, often adjusting tempo of drum machine on the fly to match tempo, a skill that is lost with DAW’s</p>
<p>I am still looking forward to a feature that would allow Auxy to sync to a midi clock as a slave and without any computer involved (no ableton link please).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I can only get better at tempo syncing manually and become more dexterous.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with using Auxy as a professional instrument or even the only source of your music, as long as is good stuff and you learn in the process!</p>

            <p>I remember watching an interview (from memory in might have been with Richie Hawtin) discussing the difference between having your music dictated by the software versus finding something that lets you truly express yourself.</p>
<p>Given Auxy’s limited feature set and only ~100 synth presets, I’ve never felt like I could capture ‘my sound’ without extra tools.</p>

            <p>Yeah I was gonna say, if you’ve been sinking your teeth into something like Harmor you’re gonna be hard pressed to find an equivalent, especially in a mobile app…</p>
<p>I fully agree with what <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/ballistik">@BALLISTIK</a> says - I switch back and forth between different apps and programs all the time. It’s part of the process. Right now, I’m getting 90% of what I need out of solely Auxy. If/when that changes later we’ll see how things go <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yes definitely. As you can already tell my tracks are very sound design heavy <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

            <p>Also, the genre you make is much easier to produce on DAWs, I assume. There are much more presets, and sound design is way easier.</p>

            <p>I know how you feel, I’ve been using Logic Pro for close to 3 years and I’m still learning how to do it.  However, if you take the time to use a complex DAW like Logic or Ableton a lot, you will start to become more and more productive.<br>
To elaborate, I tend to go back and forth between both programs (Auxy and Logic Pro.) I get tired of Logic Pro, and then use Auxy.  Eventually, I get sick of Auxy and come back to Logic Pro again.  Both programs do different things for me.  Auxy has allowed me to grow in my knowledge of songwriting/producing.  Logic Pro is much more versatile, and thus lets me be more flexible.<br>
In the end, I think Logic Pro X is probably going to be my go-to DAW.  But, in the words of Andrew Huang: “the studio is a kind of living, breathing animal.  It’s constantly changing to fit whatever I’m doing.” I have certainly found this to be true, so I use both.</p>
<p>Just my really long and elaborate personal opinion <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Thats the problem. I already know the ins and outs of how to mix and master. I have used FL studio demo in the past (Made sound design using image lines Harmor, up on my SC) I have a mac anyway and I would rather use Ableton instead. Money is the issue really, not so much Auxy being bad, not at all. Auxy just isnt ideal for the level of production I am striving for.</p>

            <p>I’d recommend exporting the projects to a mastering app such as FL studio to master your tracks, and even export the midi out and using other instruments instead of others to achieve different sounds not capable with Auxy as of now. Auxy’s mixing is ok, but it’s not perfect. Pro tip when sending over, remove effects such as Delay, Reverb and make the volume not maxed on parts to avoid clipping.</p>

            <p>I understand completely where you’re coming from with this.</p>
<p>The phrase I use is ‘Auxy finished’, as I’m yet to produce something that I feel would sit well next to - and, yes, <em>compete with</em> - music made using more traditional, professional processes.</p>
<p>Consequently, all my pieces that I think have potential for proper commercial release are named/tagged as ‘demos’.</p>
<p>Now, I may be overly critical, but I can’t shake that nagging voice that each of those tracks can and should be ‘finished properly’ before properly pushing them out into the world.</p>
<p>I think there is enough potential in each track to ‘be something’ that I’m reluctant to release them without that polish. I feel like it could waste the good potential that those pieces might have.</p>
<p>It’s not about the track being ‘perfect’, but about sufficiently closing the gap between what I’ve made in Auxy and what’s out there to give my tracks a reasonable, fighting chance.</p>
<p>Now, all that said, I am actually planning to work with a composer/producer friend to actually make that happen, and to finish (no air quotes) those tracks in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>If I didn’t have solid plans set to make that happen, I would definitely be pushing my stuff up onto Spotify, etc… already. Until they’re out there in the world, they have zero chance of getting traction and doing me any good - which means that all the time and effort I put into them really <em>is</em> wasted.</p>
