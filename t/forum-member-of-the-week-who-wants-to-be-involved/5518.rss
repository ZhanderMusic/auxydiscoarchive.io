    <title>Forum Member of the Week - Who wants to be involved?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-member-of-the-week-who-wants-to-be-involved/5518</link>
    <description>**Forum Member of the Week (2018)**

Each week:
- A forum member is randomly chosen, from the names listed below. 
- We all listen to at least one of their tracks (or more) during that week. 
- We all provide at least one comment / feedback about their music during their week. 

Only add your name to the numbered list below if: 
a) You want to be included in the weekly draw.
b) You&#39;re happy to listen / leave feedback for others in their weeks.
The order of names below doesn&#39;t matter, as names will be chosen randomly. Because there are more than 52 names listed below, not everyone will get a turn this year - depends if your name is randomly chosen. But you&#39;ve all got an equal chance of selection. 

Anyone is welcome to put their name forward, regardless of skill level. Just click the EDIT button and add yourself to the list. If you&#39;re new and can&#39;t see the EDIT button, then click the FLAG icon under the post and ask us to add you. 

If the randomly selected producer hasn&#39;t been providing any feedback for other featured members then their name goes back in the list and another random producer is chosen until someone that&#39;s actively supportive is chosen. We&#39;ll put [Skipped] next to anyone who is skipped. Three skips and their name is removed.  

If you don&#39;t want to be in the draw for your own week, that&#39;s fine. You can still listen / leave feedback for others, to be supportive.
