    <description>So one day @INDIR3CT, @Graye, and I were on the &quot;Who do you want to collaborate with?&quot; sub and Gavin said

[quote=&quot;Graye, post:210, topic:3183&quot;]
There a lot:
...
@INDIR3CT 
...
...
@eohr
... 
[/quote]

and I said

[quote=&quot;eohr, post:215, topic:3183&quot;]
@Graye
@INDIR3CT
Southborne but I can’t @ him
Lots of others but I’m too lazy
[/quote]

and then INDIR3CT said

[quote=&quot;INDIR3CT, post:216, topic:3183, full:true&quot;]
@Graye and @eohr lets do it
[/quote]

After about 4 months we came up with this track and decided to submit it to Frontier (and to my surprise, they accepted: **yeehaw!**) INDIR3CT gave it a super chill trappy feel, as he can always do. Then I threw in some funky chords and gave them some fancy volume automation. And, at the end, Gavin took it away with a huge epic drop that words fail to describe...

So you&#39;ll just have to listen to it to find out!
