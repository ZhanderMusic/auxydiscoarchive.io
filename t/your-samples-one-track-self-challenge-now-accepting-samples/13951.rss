    <title>Your Samples, One Track [Self Challenge] (NOW ACCEPTING SAMPLES)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/your-samples-one-track-self-challenge-now-accepting-samples/13951</link>
    <description>OK, so I have an interesting idea for a track, but I want to have community involvement.  Similar to Andrew Huang&#39;s community sample type vids, i want to try and do something like that, but have everything such as samples, bpm, and key provided by everyone here.  

So i&#39;ll start with some polls for bpm ranges and key.  Top picks for those will be set key and bpm range for the track.  

Then I will start accepting samples/sounds from everyone.  You can submit anything from a single note with a whole lot of automation to a drum fill or a chord progression or even some third party sample (I&#39;ll limit those to no longer than 10 seconds just to help keep things neat)

I&#39;ll be arranging everything in Ableton (because im learning it and also so im not trying to manage a million project files), but again, it would all be made of sounds from the community/ you guys.  

KEY
[poll type=regular results=on_vote public=true]

* C
* D
* E
* F
* G
* A
* B
[/poll]
[poll name=poll4 type=regular results=on_vote public=true]
* Sharp
* Flat
* Neither
[/poll]
[poll name=poll2 type=regular results=on_vote public=true]
* Major
* Minor
[/poll]

BPM
[poll name=poll3 type=regular results=on_vote public=true]
* 60-80
* 80-100
* 100-120
* 120-140
* 140-160
* 160-180
* 180-200
* 200+
[/poll]

Will prob close the polls saturday or sunday

            <p>You can send kits, but it should be in the format of a “sample” (also i dont have the sub so that too).  You could do a whole drum loop for me to use, or you could simply just do a single hit every 4 bars and make them individual samples.</p>
<p>idk if you’ve ever DL’ed a sample pack with drums, but at least with cymatics, you usually get a premade drum loop and another folder with all the individual drum samples from that loop</p>
