            <p>You could be out of upload time.</p>
<p>Another thing might just be phone glitch/error, i’ve gotten them before.  Just restart your device and it should work.</p>

            <p>Try going to the tracks section in the drop down menu in the corner (with your SC screen name). If your remaining upload time is 0 minutes… then get ready to either pay for SC Pro or to delete some old songs.</p>
<p>If you have enough upload time for the songs you’re posting, then it means SC is down. Check the topic I posted above for help. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

    I would like to get a track out today, but unfortunately, Auxy won’t upload to SoundCloud. It simply says ‘Upload Failed.’ 
 <a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/5/58d7e3b926536af053edf9ef2618b0255f755136.jpg" title="9E451E6A-B6E9-4EEB-AFC8-1214659FF270.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[image]</a> 
I’ve tried again multiple times, but I always get the same message. In Pulse, the uploaded track shows up, but there’s no cover art on anything, and when I press ‘play in SoundCloud,’ I’m redirected to a website saying my track was not found. It’s like the track was… half-uploaded.

I have faced this problem before, but the second time I uploaded it work…
