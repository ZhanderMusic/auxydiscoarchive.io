    <title>Thank You - eohr [house?]</title>

    <description>**_ALL PINGS IN THIS MESSAGE ARE NOT FOR ATTENTION, I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD @ SOME PEOPLE..._**


So in the states (and otherwhere if you do) the celebration of Thanksgiving begins soon, and now that I have been consistently using Auxy for a year, I feel like there is no better time to say Thank You.

Thanks to @INDIR3CT for his original support after I released [Flex](https://soundcloud.com/eohr/flex), thanks to @Mr_Mooo for always listening and liking my music, and helping me get out there with a great collaboration, [Meraki](https://soundcloud.com/mr_mooo/meraki). Also, huge thanks to Auxy for multiple reposts, thanks to @Hum4n01d, @Graye, and @Peregrihn for their interest in my music, and thanks to @stereofield and the entire Frontier team for being a great group and the only discord server other than ARNetwork I chose to join. Finally, I want to thank Auxy in general for being such an amazing app to create with, and a wonderful community full of great support and love.

There is some pretty cool stuff coming up from eohr, and I would like to just say thank you to everyone for endless support, and this great world for simply existing.

and i have a new track: soundcloud.com/eohr/thank-you</description>
