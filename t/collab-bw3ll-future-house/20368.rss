            <p>Depends, I posted a few future bounce projects, but I’m mainly the future bounce guy here other than Bw3ll</p>
<p>Also a magician never reveals his secrets</p>

Some stuff I changed :</p>
<ul>
<li>I varied more lines to the piano. It’s unnecessary, based off on your request, but I figured it should as it’s a solo.</li>
<li>Added pauses in build-ups. Pauses will make the listener realize how loud the song has become and leaving silence is a good tension maker before it drops.</li>
<li>I didn’t do much about the chorus, but I played with the sweeper, and I did this one effective method that I found through Assasinerd’s one project (I forgot what the title was) and applied them here.</li>
<li>I mostly added minor sound cues so the listeners know it’s progressing pretty well and know where they are.</li>
<li>The second Build-Up was pretty much the same, except the “Tense” is screaming at the top of its lungs before the drop.</li>
<li>I also think the thing that wasn’t making it loud and powerful was the setting for the ducker. It’s set to “Trigger  Every Beat”.  You don’t want that, because if you’re making a different variation to the percussion, then the ducker of the melody/ies won’t match.</li>
<li>(Edit)  I forgot to mention; Don’t showcase very powerful instruments at the start. That’s also the reason why the Chorus wasn’t exciting as it were before it even climaxes. So ye.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. The song is fire as usual. Can’t wait for the final product. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/star_struck.png?v=9" title=":star_struck:" class="emoji" alt=":star_struck:"></p>
