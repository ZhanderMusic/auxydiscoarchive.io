    <title>&#39;Replies in a row&#39; limit. Disable for higher level members?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/replies-in-a-row-limit-disable-for-higher-level-members/21487</link>
    <description>Hi.

Forum settings currently limit how many posts a member can make in a row, within a thread, to three.

Is it possible to disable that limit for members above a certain trust level?
(Or can someone post something, so it resets my posts-in-a-row limit? ;)

I ask bc I&#39;m prevented from adding more posts to this thread…

Ofc, I could start a new thread, but it&#39;s handy to have that kind of info contained in a single thread.
Alternatively, I could simply stop sharing stuff like this. (Tbh, it&#39;s unclear if anyone&#39;s getting any value from that info — though it&#39;s aimed at encouraging members to push their music a bit further by showing the what/how.)</description>

            <p>i mean it was made for people not to spam and i get it but i don’t think that the person with the highest trust level would spam like a psychopath (pretty much one of the reasons why they are named <em>trust</em> levels)</p>
