    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/slow-feelings-andrew-young-ambient/9419</link>
    <description>I used loops from Ambient Rimshots throughout the track and used the Gentle Steel guitar from Acoustic Guitars near the end of the track.

            <p>Nice, subtle, slightly, jazzy, dubby vibe.<br>

Q: Why did you include ‘Auxy Studio’ in the track title?</p>
<p>Try to avoid defining your music as ‘Auxy music’ so overtly.<br>
It’s one thing to include the <em><span class="hashtag">#auxy</span></em> tag, to be findable to Auxy fans, but imo, having it in the name could prevent some people giving it a serious chance.</p>
<p>I’d also think of something different to say in the track description, like what you’re aiming for in the track – the mood, the vibe, the inspiration — rather than just talking about the sound packs you’ve used.</p>
<p>Tbh, imo, you should put as much effort into presenting the music and your SC account as you do with your music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
For instance, sort out your SC URL, <em>user-324781623</em>.</p>
<p>Also, imo, you should revisit the genre and mood tagging for the track.<br>
