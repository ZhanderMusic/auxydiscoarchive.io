            <p>Definitely not future house, thatâ€™s a completely different genre.</p>
<p>But I can see where your coming from.</p>
<p>Also can you briefly explain a few of the theory things you mentioned that have to do with postitioning chords</p>

            <p>Thank you for the feedback! Yeah haha this is definitely my worst track. Made it during producerâ€™s block; actually talking with stereofield right now about taking it down.</p>
<p>But who knows, I may make a much better VIP version sometime in the future ;D</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This just rolled up after listening to another Auxianâ€™s trackâ€¦</p>
<p>Surprised thereâ€™s been no engagement here.</p>
<p>Quite a simple track. The piano chord progression and the way you resolve the progression actually makes the bar count feel a little odd.</p>
<p>i.eâ€¦<br>
Bar 5 feels like an extra bar added to the first progression/run-through â€“ which sounds quite satisfying.<br>
Bar 6 sounds like an inversion of the chord from Bar 1, creating the impression that the progression has started a second run-through.<br>
However, the progression ends just two bars later, which makes the drop feel likes itâ€™s coming in a bar early, creating the feel (to me*) that the bars are actually 5 + 3 (rather than 4 + 4)</p>
<p>Generally, the progression feels ambiguous.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m assuming the track wonâ€™t be updated, but maybe consider adding in a greater sense of build towards drops/choruses, especially when the structure isnâ€™t so standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Maybe itâ€™s just locked in my head that way now â€“ â€˜Yanny/Laurelâ€™-style â€“ and itâ€™s hard to hear if differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Btw, feels like itâ€™s really suitable for vocals.<br>
I started mumbling vocal lines from the very first bar.</p>
<p>At 2â€™43", itâ€™s quite short, which makes me think thereâ€™s space for an additional bridge, where everything is stripped back to the same simplicity of the first few bars, before coming back to the drop/chorus/chords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Not sure Iâ€™d call it Future Bass. The chorus/drop is definitely FB, but the main thrust of the track is a house vibe.<br>
Future House?</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know enough about FB or Future House to say for sure, but my instincts say that FB isnâ€™t the right primary genre.</p>
