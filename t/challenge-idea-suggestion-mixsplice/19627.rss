    <title>Challenge idea suggestion: MixSplice</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/challenge-idea-suggestion-mixsplice/19627</link>
    <description>Hello!

An idea I’ve been thinking about is to create a remix thread where someone posts a project and other people remix it.

Of course that’s not the full idea, silly!

The caveat here is that *each remix is also open to be remixed*, such that the people involved can eventually create a track only tangentially related to the original song, where each remix can be traced “genetically” back to the parent by following a chain of other remixes.

There doesn’t have to be only one direct remix “child” descendant from the original, by the way. Make a really diverse gene pool!

Happy splicing!</description>
