    <description>I&#39;ve had this idea for a while, about changing the way someone or something sounds by adding effects. if you know what overtones are than maybe you get what I&#39;m saying. When you make a note by singing and you change the shape of your mouth you can sometimes get a high pitched sound in addition to the note you sing. I want to see if I could replicate this with instruments. Do you think this is crazy or have you ever seen something like this?:sweat_smile:</description>

    revolutionary for me, anyways 
so i had this idea around an hour prior to posting this, and testing revealed better results than i had expected 
<a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/q_r8bQXV79B6bemk8DR5lQ==" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://app.auxy.co/projects/q_r8bQXV79B6bemk8DR5lQ==</a> 
this is a project with four tracks. the first loops hold the same test melody. the second ones are where i applied the trick. 
this idea was born from some boring sound science about overtones. how the trick itself works is that the melody is raised by an octave, and then a perfect fifth above that …

    So, I just released a new song (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabajaj/liftoff" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://soundcloud.com/sanabajaj/liftoff</a>), and a lot of the sounds (Gossip, Runner, even Sweeper) I noticed sounded  way better when I added some reverb to it, or changed the tone. Do you guys have any tips and tricks about sound editing you want to share? Post 'em here! <img width="20" height="20" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=10" title="smiley" alt="smiley" class="emoji">

<p>Exactly…here’s a sound that comes from playing with automation on the tone of the piano. I think this is the closest to an overtone that I’ve found</p>

            <p>Silo has a limiting effect if you turn the tone all the way up, here’s playing with octaves reverb and delay…<br>
Not exactly what you are taking about… But it’s still fun</p>

<p>Really quick example of what I’m talking about</p>
<p>PS it’s fun to play with the delay on it as well. Like I think I set this one to 1/8 but try putting it to 1/16 etc</p>

            <p>Oooooohhhhh I’m excited to see if anyone’s heard this in auxy. Closest thing I’ve heard is when you set a delay on an instrument and play with the echo by peppering the note with a new note before, during, or after the delay note bounces in</p>
