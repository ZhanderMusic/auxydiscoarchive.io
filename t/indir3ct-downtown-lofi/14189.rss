    <title>INDIR3CT - Downtown (Lofi)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indir3ct-downtown-lofi/14189</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! Been really excited to get this track finished. Recently I&#39;ve been getting into the same old repetitive routine, and have really been lacking in creativity. 

I really went all out on this one, and tried to create something different, something unique, something me. 

As always _ any comments, likes, reposts, feedback, and support is appreciated.

Thanks so much for sticking with me and supporting me to this point, and I hope this track isn&#39;t too trashy to listen to haha
[spoiler]If you are wondering... this **is** track 5 of an upcoming Debut album.[/spoiler]
Love, INDIR3CT</description>
