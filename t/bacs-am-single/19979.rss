    <title>Bacs - Am (Single)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/bacs-am-single/19979</link>
    <description>Hey! I decided to finish this track which was created 3 years ago as a melody midi project. It was a good thing to save this to Icloud before my last device finally died out XD. So kinda looking through my old files then found this project. I did included some tweak from ableton and used AUXY for bass, drums and percussions. And this is final!
