            <p>Hi. I think it’s a great piece. Some great sound design and composition style in there.</p>
<p>It’s probably because you’ve put ideas into sound design that the drum sounds feel a little ‘undesigned’ – particularly noticeable on the kick, but also the presence of the uneffected ‘toms’.<br>
They seem to be the stock sounds – and I think that creates two issues…</p>
<ol>
<li>It drags the piece back to ‘Auxy reality’ (when, up to that point, you’ve done a good job of shifting it via sound design for the tonal instruments) [This may be a symptom of being so familiar with all the stock Auxy sounds and may not be a problem to a listener who doesn’t use Auxy.]</li>
<li>(Perhaps more importantly) It misses an opportunity to put your stamp on the drum sounds too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider layering kicks, using filters to shape the elements of the sound.<br>
Consider also subtly layering tonal instruments over the toms to shape them.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just my opinion and you may consider the drums sounds perfect for what you had in mind.<br>
But, for my experience of listening to the piece, I was a little disappointed when the drums came in using undesigned sounds.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>
