    <title>Any more disco-related...?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/any-more-disco-related/636</link>
    <description>Hey there guys, MrSerpent here to ask y&#39;all a question.

Was reading through some of the messages on topics I needed a better understanding on when I noticed there was a Auxy chat on Telegram. There was also an Auxy-realted Discord.

I&#39;m not sure if these were exclusive to certain users, but if not...

If anyone could invite me to those and/or any other related chats I&#39;d love to chat with you guys.

Thanks!</description>
