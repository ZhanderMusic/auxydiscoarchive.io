    <description>Has anyone signup and release your tracks using Level Music?

[https://beta.levelmusic.com/](https://beta.levelmusic.com/)

if anyone interested you can use access code: TEAMLEVEL2018

As i read through on their sites, it is free to distribute (only they will take 8% if tracks are sold)

They even provide ASAP Release option

I have actually signup (but i have not uploaded any tracks yet, but i might try the ASAP Release to see how it goes), since Amuse App is no longer available in Malaysia App Store, so i guess i still have a different options 😄


So maybe another App like Amuse....</description>

            <p>Thought they had a 7000 plays per track + good levels of engagement threshold.<br>
(Not meant as a diss.)</p>
<p>Still, if you are using them, would be great if you could post a review in the Branding &amp; Distribution category.</p>

<p>Yea Amuse does that too, well basically mirroring what Amuse has to offer (and 1 more thing Level even specified the cover design for itunes is 2400x2400 in which i usually do for Amuse is 1700x1700, exceed what Amuse require 1600x1600)</p>
<p>Well i guess I really interested their ASAP Release option tho.</p>
<p>Hopefully i don’t intend to do anything different from what I’m producing.</p>
<p>And i might go for this as well <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/point_down/3.png?v=9" title=":point_down:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":point_down:t3:"> Beta Amuse<br>

            <p>It’s interesting that Level appears to allow you to specify countries.<br>
Distrokid doesn’t let you specify.</p>
<p>The releases are submitted to the services. After that, it’s down to which countries the services are available in.<br>
(…though some countries will automatically reject any tracks with explicit content.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’m not sure how different they’d be to Distrokid, but I wouldn’t mind trying both Amuse and Level as well. I’m intrigued by their more modern orientation.</p>
<p>Maybe if I have a third and fourth musical identity, I’ll try both Amuse and Level out.<br>
(My Distrokid account allows two different artist names/identities.)</p>

<p>I think Amuse is 7days the latest, if not mistaken, and yea Amuse is kinda popular <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging/2.png?v=5" title=":man_shrugging:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:t2:"></p>

<p>Yup true, the more platform in the market the more option it will be for releasing tracks.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/balance_scale.png?v=5" title=":balance_scale:" class="emoji" alt=":balance_scale:">️</p>
<p>So i’m currently taking “time off” from Amuse, but if they permanently blocking their app in Malaysia, then LEVEL its shall be <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

<p>I’m with Distrokid and to release asap, you’d simply select the default date setting, which is typically the current day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Aside: We seem to be gathering a range of different digital distribution accounts.</p>
<p>Amuse is popular. You’re trying Level. I think <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/NickElle">@NickElle</a> is/was with CDBaby. I’m with Distrokid.<br>
It’s good that we’ll have real experience to share about the various options. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
