    <title>Auxy Sounds into Ableton</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-sounds-into-ableton/21941</link>
    <description>Hello! I used Auxy way back when they had a completely different app and have always loved their sounds and presets. I switched from Auxy probably about half a year ago into Ableton, but constantly find myself wanting to use Auxy sounds. Is there any way to convert Auxy presets into an Ableton MIDI?</description>
