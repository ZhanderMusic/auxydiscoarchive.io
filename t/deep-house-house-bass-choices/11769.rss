    <title>Deep House/House Bass Choices</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/deep-house-house-bass-choices/11769</link>
    <description>Hi! 

Quick question for people who make house, deep house, and to some extent, techno: what basses do you use the most often or find to sound the best? I have tried numerous times to make deep house tracks, but none of the basses really sounded good. Do you have any suggestions for general settings that make a bass suitable or sound good in these types of tracks?

Thanks!</description>

<p>I agree with this for sure. When I was making deep house, I found that a lot of basses fit the song and it depended on what tone of the track I wanted. I ended up using Dirt with a lower lowpass to kinda act as a loud sub bass &amp; pepper + muffin to mimick the plucky chords I had.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the “deep” comes from the choice and length of chords. In some cases it’s how you set up the atmpsphere with balancing delay and reverb</p>

<p>The term “deep house” has come to mean many different things to many different people, being applied to everyone from Disclosure to Fred P. But the roots of the sound can be traced back to the musical innovations of one man: <strong>Larry Heard</strong>.</p>

            <p>Deep house is experimental in a lot of ways so a lot of sounds will work. Personally, I like my deep house smooth, dark, and ambient ( and occasionally melody driven)</p>
<p>Use Pepper bass with lowpass filter to 0%  for a smooth bassline. Monk and slope can give you nice pluck bass because of their hard attack shape.</p>
<p>Another thing I like to do in deep house is take a boom bass sound and make small pitch bent notes that serve as transitions… ( did this a lot in my track Safari )</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to think about the context of the song youre making. How do you want to feel when you listen?  When will you be listening to this?</p>

            <p>I’ve been wondering about house basses too but more electronic, especially with Southborne’s song Remorse (didn’t want to ping him as that can get annoying).</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/intrepidmusic">@IntrepidMusic</a> should be able to weigh in on the deep house side.</p>
<p>When I’ve made house music lately, I’ve mostly used Bee, Barber as well as Slope. All their own instrument, usually with 32nd notes in a staggered pattern to give it a more bloopy feeling. In 2050 AD, this was very evident with how slope worked in there, as for Bee that was used in my song Blip from a while back. As for Barber and other applications of Slope… well you’ll see those in the future ;3</p>
