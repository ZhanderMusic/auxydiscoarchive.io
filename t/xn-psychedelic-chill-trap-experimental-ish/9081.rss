No, I&#39;ve never taken drugs, but this is what I imagine it to sound like.


Found a real old track of mine (was literally just the melody + kick/snare). Instantly had some weird inspiration and ended up going more on the experimental side and finished it in one day.  It&#39;s pretty different from what I usually make, so let me know what you think.  

It&#39;s by no means perfect, but I&#39;m trying to push out more tracks or else i&#39;ll just end up sitting on them forever (maybe I should try and keep a release schedule of some sort).</description>
