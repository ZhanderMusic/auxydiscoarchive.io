    <title>The block has struck hard</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/the-block-has-struck-hard/7554</link>
    <description>Tornait here

Ever since the update dropped I’ve been looking at all the old stuff, and now I just look at it and don’t know what to do with it. Same thing with making new stuff. I have made a grand total of six new projects the past week and a half and have not gotten anywhere past a chorus yet.

Also, I think focusing on a new brand set messed me up in the fact that now my musical side has basically stabbed itself in the stomach and is now comatose. In simpler terms, I’ve got another block.

I need help please

Edit: I really need help with song structure and stuff, because none of my songs really have proper structure. **none** of them.</description>

            <p>Hey guys… thanks for your support. I just uploaded a new track, one I’ve been working on for the past few days. Still feel like I have a few problems with my musical discipline, but I do feel much better now.</p>

            <p>Hmm, song structure for me is just using triplets and fourth chords. Like, C, E, and G. And drop a B for a seventh. Then from there you can move it almost anywhere and it’ll sound future-y!</p>

            <p>Try making a song 100% inspired from one you really like whether it be your own or not, and when you get to a certain point, drop that 100% inspiration and trail off.</p>
<p>Try doing something you haven’t done before, try new drums, different styles of melodies, different key signatures and tempos, different sound, try using ways of automation you usually don’t use to make a new sound.</p>

    Over the years, I’ve written hundreds of jams in Auxy, Logic Pro X, Garageband for iOS, and a few other places.  I say “written” because, with a few exceptions, NOT A SINGLE ONE of them is finished.  And in order for me to make any progress in the musical world, that has got to end soon. 
Here’s my theory on why this is the case:

            <p>Wow… that feels so backwards to me. I start with a hook, build out to either a chorus or a verse, then build outwards from there.</p>
<p>Might give your method a go at some point just to see how it works out and to see if it inspires any new ideas <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Intro<br>
Verse 1<br>
Buildup<br>
Drop 1<br>
Bridge<br>
Verse 2<br>
Buildup<br>
Drop 2<br>
Outro</p>
<p>I (usually) create in this order: Make the drops, then the buildups, then the verses, then intro and outro last. But really, compose in whatever order you’re most comfortable.</p>
<p>If you have vocals, put them in the Verses/Intro/Outro</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>You must stick to the songs flow and keep going with it!</p>

            <p>lol meanwhile i’ve been doodling around with the same 5 or 6 projects for about 2-3 months now.  I should release them, but every time i go for a listen im like “yo i should change this” and i either do or just put it off till next time.<br>
So i’m pretty much just sitting on a bunch of 80-90% done tracks and havent worked on them for a while<br>
(but since the update, its been forcing me to work on them some more b/c no subscription = no drums so…)</p>

            <p>Whenever I hit a block, I move on to some other form of creativity. Example, last time I had a music block I wrote a novel. Try it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
