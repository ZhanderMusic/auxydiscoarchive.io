            <p>Thank you so much for your honest feedback, it really helped me a lot for my future Trap tracks! This was my first time trying out Trap, so I’m not that used to it.</p>

            <p>Nice work! I thought you used the imported sounds really well overall. Loved the weapon samples! The track was interesting and I enjoyed listening to it and I’m impressed with the detail and layering. Despite all those instruments building the sound, I thought you maintained a sense of order and restraint, so that it never seemed too chaotic.</p>
<p>Two points that would improve it from my perspective (take them with a grain of salt, cos I’m no expert): 1. The imported exhale ‘ah’ didn’t work with me. I’d use it a lot less or take it out and find a different sound for that part in the composition. 2. It needs a stronger (maybe simpler) hook/chorus with a melody that cuts through and can be remembered by the listener.</p>
<p>I’d love to see your project file, cos I think I could learn a lot from it. I think you’ve pulled together some cool techniques.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing and I look forward to hearing your next track!</p>
