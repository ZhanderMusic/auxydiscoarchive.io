            <p>I think something like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" rel="nofollow noopener">DigitalOcean</a> would be the quick/easy/cheap way to go.</p>
<p>They have a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/discourse" rel="nofollow noopener">one-click droplet</a> ready to go, and you can get up and running for about $5 per month.</p>

            <p>Yeah you’d need to run it on some kind of server or desktop platform. The forum software itself is free, it’s packaged up as a docker image I’m pretty sure. I briefly looked into it out of curiosity. You’d have a harder go of getting connectivity to the server from the internet if you were hosting it yourself, not to mention all the security considerations you’d need to make sure are in place to make sure nothing gets compromised.</p>
<p>There’s a few other forums I’ve seen using discourse- the In Thread forum for Sonic Pi (  <a href="https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/</a> ) the unofficial TE forums ( <a href="https://op-forums.com/c/op-1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://op-forums.com/c/op-1</a> ) - you’ll find me there under a different name and not very active. It’s bizarre when you see another Discourse site out in the wild for the first time, it’s like a strange cousin you see on the holidays <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

            <p>It’ll cost you a lot less than having them host it for you. Especially since you can more closely tailor your hosting specifications to your forum size.</p>
