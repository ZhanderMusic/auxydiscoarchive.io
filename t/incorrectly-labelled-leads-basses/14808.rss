<p>There has been projects where Mental is used as a Lead and works with the entire project. It’s probably determined from what pitch the notes are and how you tuned it.</p>

            <p>If we’re being technical, Bumble would also be classified under “Bass” because it is entirely in the low octaves, the exact same range as most of the sub-basses. But this is because it is functional as a chord-type instrument.</p>
<p>The division itself is rather arbitrary. I mean, they classified a Tuba as a lead in Hipster Horns (not to mention it’s all highs :\). It’s mostly on how the instrument is intended to be used, a general guidance on the range and scope.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, most leads are multi-voiced with some to mild detune on these voices (like a supersaw), while most basses are one-voice (mono) instruments that resonate strongly with precise tuning. There’s plenty of crossover to be had, especially when you want a strong “lead” that isn’t strong with detune. I’ve often used Pasta, Crater or Player One to accomplish this.</p>
<p>In summary, don’t let instrument classifications determine how to use the instrument, it’s more of a guideline, showing the strong suit.</p>

            <p>Honestly lots of leads could be basses and vice versa. I don’t pay much attention to the classifications. Any sound can be used however you want.</p>
