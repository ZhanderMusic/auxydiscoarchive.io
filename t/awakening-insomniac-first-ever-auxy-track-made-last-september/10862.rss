    <title>Awakening - Insomniac (First Ever Auxy Track made last September)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/awakening-insomniac-first-ever-auxy-track-made-last-september/10862</link>
    <description>This was my first ever original song using Auxy. I still had the original sound pack and I had no experience with writing electronic songs. It is the first installment in a concept album I tried to do about Platoâ€™s allegory of the Cave. Iâ€™m not too fond of it now but I thought it was huge when I first made it... I just wanna see what the community has to say about it:

Edit: I just wanna say that if I actually tried, I could make this a 1000 times better and shorter too and then my friends wouldnâ€™t keep making fun of me because my first song was crapðŸ˜‚</description>
