            <p>This was fun to watch. I feel like I struggle in making good drum tracks so this was helpful for me. I kinda wanna take a year to learn drums in order to get some hands on insight into creating realistic beats. Sometime in the distant future perhaps?</p>

<p>Nah, that kid was even more of a d**k than I am. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
(I recently digitised hours of synth ideas from my late teens, that I’ll maybe be plucking some stuff from and developing.)</p>
<p>But, hey, if you think there’s anything good you could get out of that stuff, feel free.<br>
(I’ve set it for downloads.)</p>
<p>For me, the best bit is the tape clicks and noise before the drums actually start. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
(I’ve got an underused <a href="https://www.strymon.net/elcapistan/">Strymon El Capistan dTape delay</a> if I wanted to add some age and wonkiness to stuff now.)</p>

<p>You should clean the sample up a little and build a track on top of it. Would give a nice low-fi sound, and it’s an interesting idea to collaborate with a younger version of yourself.</p>
<p>Hm, Auxy time capsules. Now there’s an interesting thought <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

<p>A bit of on-topic comic relief during the interval?</p>
<p>(A dodgy, old cassette recording of) The first ever piece of music I created and recorded (back in the mists of time.) was a drum track on a Yamaha RY30. The first time I’d ever touched a proper piece of electronic music hardware.</p>
