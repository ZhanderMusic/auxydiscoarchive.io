**Notes**: I try to make it sound as &#39;live&#39; as possible using Auxy. My bigest problem is with percussion it&#39;s hard to make it swing - like jazz perc should, any ideas, examples? Maybe any midi files to download and learn? **Can ya give me any links?** 
I have tried to cut parts of live loops and use it, but changed my mind as I feel it would be cheating - I want to make it - note by note, beat by beat from the scratch without using any loops. As for acoustic bass/upright bass used here - it was cut from few sources into &#39;one shoots&#39; - I have made new instrument than written it&#39;s line note by note, from the scratch - thanks to this I can completely control it. There are few notes missing but thanks to pitch-shifting I can play most of needed notes. 

Thanks for constructive feedback and remember its fresh work (in progress) - I have started just 2 days ago and had been playing with it only just for aprox. 30 minutes, so don&#39;t be too harsh.

            <p>Use longer rides, it gives more flow</p>
<p>Edit: I take it back a little, its really up to you how you do jazz. I personally prefer jazz when the instruments connect but theres all kinds of jazz</p>

            <p>To get swing on any drum or sound, you just have to tap on the cog icon in the top right of a project, and between the tempo and key sliders there is a slider to control how much swing you want in that track. Alternatively you could just use triplets in a pattern like this:<br>
<img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/4/43ac7fab6792daed0379d506620e1206f90a0a78.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9EFzaHtOtDSGIFtm3eB38fifpnW" width="308" height="377"></p>
<p>Also,  swing doesn’t do anything to triplets.<br>
Hope this helps!</p>
