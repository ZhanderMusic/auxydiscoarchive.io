    <title>STAND WITH ME- V/M (collab?)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/stand-with-me-v-m-collab/7676</link>
    <description>Hey everybody! My newest song, STAND WITH ME, is in the process of creating and I was wondering if anyone would like to collaborate on it with me. DM me if you are interested.

The demo is here:
https://app.auxy.co/projects/plz98bghvng-Lx4B8M-QRw==
The acoustic version is right here:
https://app.auxy.co/projects/i9RCPDwXFVpmVyfiK0A2vg==
I know what you’re thinking. This isn’t the best. But that’s why I need a collaborator on this.</description>

            <p>I think the main 2 problems were the chords were pretty uninteresting, and the projects were 2 one sided, not enough of the other. So, I made this. Good thing you got going here, lot’s of potential!<br>
