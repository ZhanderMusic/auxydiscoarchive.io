            <p>Thanks for the feedback DreadedClout! I agree its hard to mix out all the â€˜mudâ€™ on auxy alone but itâ€™s doable. Adding to the beat is gonna be hard itâ€™s pretty layered and yes i make other genres aswell, theyâ€™re not on the soundcloud though but iâ€™m also into macking liquid drum and bass, techno even a hardcore song lol</p>

            <p>Honestly the track is amazing, i love the whole aesthetic but what i have to say may just be a personal preference it may not even be necessary for this genre.</p>
<p>It would have been nice for there to be a little change up in the melody or the drums just so it doesnâ€™t stay repetitive all throughout.<br>
Also if the background noise was to have a little bit of panning maybe?</p>
<p>But other than that I donâ€™t really have anything else to say, do you work with other genres?</p>
