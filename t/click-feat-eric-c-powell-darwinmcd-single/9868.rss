    <description>Hello fellow Auxians! 

Been away for a while, but back to tell you I’ve been busy working on a new single that was released today  callled “Click”, featuring vocals by a good friend of mine, Eric C. Powell.  Eric also added some additional instrumentation to my original Auxy demo (and mastered the final mix).  

If you want to check it out and let me know what you think, here’s a link to a page with links to all of the digital outlets “Click” has been distributed to: 

http://smarturl.it/ecp-click

The single contains the vocal mix, a “voxless” mix, and my original Auxy demo mix.
