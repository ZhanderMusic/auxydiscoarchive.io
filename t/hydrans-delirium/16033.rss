    <description>hey everyone! 

I just posted another one on my second account, but this one as a bit of a backstory. I started work on this song in January and I planned to have it released on a label. however, since I started working on experimental bass music in FL (which is a very different genre) I also had some label releases with that style planned. I ended up cancelling the label release for this track because I wanted to keep a specific sound/genre in all of my tracks. 

now that I have started up an alt account, I can post Auxy stuff again, so I thought I&#39;d release this one.

please follow my alt account if you&#39;re interested in hearing my Auxy stuff again since I won&#39;t be posting anything Auxy on my main. [spoiler]follow my main too though haha[/spoiler]

here is the link to follow my alt account: https://soundcloud.com/hydrans2
here is the link to listen to delirium: https://soundcloud.com/hydrans2/delirium

[spoiler]hopefully Auxy notices my alt lol[/spoiler]</description>
