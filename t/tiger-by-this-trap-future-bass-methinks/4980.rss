&gt; Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies,
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?

album will be out later than expected. hope this makes up for it.</description>

            <p>Awesome, love the staccato part around 2:15 where everything just gets CHOPPED up, also, some of the reverb tails sound like exhaling samples, so cool. Love it!</p>
