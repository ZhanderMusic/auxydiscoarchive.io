    <title>How did you hear about Auxy?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-did-you-hear-about-auxy/2735</link>
    <description>Just wondering. I saw the Youtuber ‘Andrew Huang’ using it and needed to check it out instantly.. 

So. That happened.

            <p>Do you remember how you discovered Auxy?</p>
<p>I’m looking at ways to improve the forum and it would be useful to understand how you first discovered this awesome music app.</p>
<p>I can’t remember how I discovered it myself, but would be interested to know if any of you can remember?</p>

            <p>Pretty sure I was looking for a music making/mixing app on my phone for no reason and i saw it and decided to get it. I didn’t even make music at the time but I thought it would be fun to try. Also I’ve had a bunch of people ask me about Auxy and I know someone is planning on joining soon so that’s a way people find it to.</p>
<p>Edit: I stoped using Auxy for a couple months and then I saw Andrew Huang’s video on it and I started making stuff on it a gain.</p>

            <p>It suited my workflow much better. It’s really easy to put down ideas quickly in Ableton, as you don’t have to use “musical typing” or whatever, and the settings allow for clicking to place down a midi note vs selecting the brush tool. Also, the clips are awesome, and it allows you to create music in a D-J like fashion. Plus, all the effects are automatically organized in Ableton and all the windows fit on one screen. The only reasons Logic could be better is because 1) It comes with a lot of free synths and sounds and 2) the interface is pretty</p>

            <p>This is kinda unrelated, but why did you switch from Logic to Ableton? Just wondering cuz I’m thinking about doing it myself.</p>

            <p>About a year ago Inwas looking for an app on my iPad that I could make “real music” with, and I found the green-logoed Auxy. I made some pretty trash songs with it, then left it for GarageBand and eventually Logic. When I converted to Ableton, I downloaded the white-logoed Auxy and liked it a lot. Now, it’s pretty much my main DAW.</p>

            <p>I got sick of GarageBand for iOS, and wanted more sounds, so I went searching on the App Store, and found Auxy (the old iPad version.)  It also happened that the next day I was going to be on a long car ride to the beach, so I had plenty of time to try it out.</p>

            <p>I was trying to find an alternative DAW (i…e. i was going on a roadtrip without my computer and I still wanted to make music) and I download like 5 apps. Out of all of them, Auxy seemed the most promising, so I kept it.</p>

            <p>Well, I guess it was a complicated story. One day I found Auxy on the App Store and decided to try it out though I didn’t like it very much. Then after experimenting and making trash I decided I hated it. Then the revolutiionary update came out and I absolutely loved it and I actually started to make half decent stuff. Then that led to where I am now.</p>

            <ol start="2015">
<li>I saw auxy in the AppStore and tried it. It was hard as frick then, so I quickly chose MusicMakerJam over Auxy. That didn’t end long.</li>
<li>It is basically how <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/el1011">@El1011</a> found Auxy. I was scrolling through the AppStore when I found it again. And look where I’m at now.</li>
