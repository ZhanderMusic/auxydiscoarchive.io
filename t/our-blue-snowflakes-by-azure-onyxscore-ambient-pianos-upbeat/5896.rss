    <description>My first track of 2018

https://soundcloud.com/azureonyx/our-blue-snowflakes

I wanted to get a track released for 2018, despite the amount of people leaving the community... it&#39;s just sad. Mark your calendars for the 25th of January for the new update.

I was originally gonna upload this for Christmas. However, I had other projects holding me back. Plus, the track wasn&#39;t good by my standards.</description>

            <p>I liked it! I wasn’t really actively listening cuz I was checking my twitter feed but the melodies kept me interested throughout. The song didn’t get boring at all and I quite enjoyed… thanks for the sweet music!</p>
