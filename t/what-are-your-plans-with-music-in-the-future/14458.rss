            <p>i wanna make beats for the top rappers and singers in music, as well as promote some more underground artists and hopefully help them get into the mainstream. the other option is to become somewhat famous on some livestream lofi hip hop radio thing and get a lot of clout, then become a rapper and rap on my own beats</p>

            <p>Experimentation can alwasy endeavour something useful or succesfull. I see potential in u if u keep messing around with music. Maybe u could become a sound fix designer for movies and games if r not string on a full song structure</p>

            <p>You could try expanding your genre. Dubstep might be hard to do in Auxy, but there’s Trap, DnB, and Hardstyle. All really hard-hitting genres. And Ambient is nice for soundscapes.</p>

            <p>I doubt I’ll have many options to progress much further in the music world. Maybe soundtracks to horror movies that will never exist. Idk I’ll probably just make hundreds of tracks for no reason beyond I just personal enjoyment.</p>
