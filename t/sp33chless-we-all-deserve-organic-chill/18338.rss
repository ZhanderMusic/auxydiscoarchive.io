    <description>Hi Auxy fam,

This is my first time branching out into the community - but I’ve been making music with Auxy for almost a year or so now. I just wanted to say that Auxy has been my first delve into the world of music creation. But I’m finally at a point where I feel confident enough to share. So here we go:

***We All Deserve*** - (Organic, Chill) https://soundcloud.com/superlativerxns/we-all-deserve/s-YcJve - This track is one of my earlier ones where I gave an organic drum-kit feel to it, or tried to. I wanted to really utilize the great guitar sounds on Auxy with more authentic sounding drums.</description>
