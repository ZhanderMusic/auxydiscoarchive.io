            <p>I use the itch drum kit a lot in my songs because I LOVE rock music. Keep share 01 and add vintage snare 76 and also I use the knock knock crash cymbal too.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/therealjfalc">@TheRealJFalc</a> put some good suggestions in, may I add that there’s probably a few kicks in the Kickdrum Collection (you’ll have to go digging yourself, sorry!) and a few snares tweaked a bit from Nu Disco that could work nicely! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If you don’t mind me asking, are you making a rock song in Auxy? It’s fun to try them, I’ve done a few that are more electronic-rock than anything, but that’s because we don’t have electric guitars yet.</p>

            <p>I’d say look in the Organic Elements packs (both 1 and 2), along with possibly Neurofunk. If that all fails, Superfluidity and/or Crate Diggers may have what you need.</p>
