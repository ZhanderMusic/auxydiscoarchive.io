    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-32-winner-announced/19294</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @Peregrihn 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

<p>For his skillful work in turning Auxy presets into what  could be amassed into a progressive alternative band, and for capturing the vibe of not only the anime intro sequence he set out to create, but also harkening back, for me personally, to a-ha‚Äôs Hunting High and Low which happens to be one of my favorite songs ever.</p>
<p>Congratulations <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/the_osprey">@The_Osprey</a> , and good job to everyone who submitted, this week was definitely close between a few of you. Feel free to dm me if you want feedback!</p>
<p>Again I am truly sorry for dropping the ball on Judging/scheduling <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

            <p>Sheeeiiiii‚Ä¶ well I really dropped the ball here. I need to set a reminder or something.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not entirely sure where Peregrihn is. I guess I‚Äôll take over the judging again. I am going to close this but WILL accept all entries, even the late ones (all previously posted rules still apply though!!). Will try to have the results in by Friday.</p>
<p>Totw will resume ON MONDAY.</p>
