    <title>Gunship - Drone Racing League (Cheddr Drive-Push Remix)</title>

I made this for a remix contest for the popular synthwave band Gunship&#39;s remix contest.

I chopped up their vocal stems into 4 bar chunks outside of Auxy (I used the free Cakewalk by Bandlab for that). Imported them into Auxy and produced the whole rest of the track using Auxy. Mixed and mastered in auxy and uploaded to soundcloud. Who would have thought I could do something this elaborate on my phone. Auxy is the best.

Vocals stems and songwriting by Gunship.
All instrumentation, arrangement and remix production by Cheddr.
All Rights Horsie in the Hedge Limited.

Here&#39;s the contest.

            <p>Nah, not a voting kind of a thing. Itâ€™s just up to them who they want to pick. Details in the link. Today was the last day.</p>
<p>You could grab the stems if you want to play with them. They are very good. Thanks for the compliments!</p>
