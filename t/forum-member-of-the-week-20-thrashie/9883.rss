&lt;small&gt; This week, several random selections were tossed back in the selection pool, as they hadn&#39;t provided any feedback recently. But then the super-dooper-randomiser spat out..... &lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #20: @Thrashie  &lt;/big&gt; 

&lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;hrashie  (A.K.A Zack Riley, A.K.A RainbroThrash) is from Texas and likes anime, gaming and playing the drums.  His musical tastes include Trap, Hybrid Trap, Experimental Trap, Dubstep, Drumstep and... metal (he&#39;d like to start a Deathcore band). He listens to [ThaTrackaz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiQf_0nQtbsN_m3YGHrgS0A), [Jordan Comoli](https://soundcloud.com/jordancomolli), [Scraton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5ceb5aLKALh-g6vhAcpxw), [Vylet](https://www.youtube.com/user/MusiciansOfPonyville) &amp;  [Taps](https://www.youtube.com/user/FIVETEENTAPS). 

There&#39;s darker themes explored in his music, in case the album name &quot;Omen&quot;, the name &quot;Thrashie&quot; and his upcoming track named &quot;Evil under Floorboards&quot; didn&#39;t make that clear. There&#39;s also an experimental aspect to his music. It&#39;s different. And interesting. Plus, one of his Auxy tracks is written entirely using imported samples.  

Listen to  [Thrashie&#39;s music](https://soundcloud.com/rainbrothrash/tracks).

            <p>Sorry for the last second reply! I’ve been really busy this week with testing at school. I really like your style. Its really unique, with some glitchy aspects to it, and it’s really powerful. I think you’ve done a great job with that style in Mafia. I absolutely love the teasers of Sheol’s Leviathan. I think that one’s my favorite, probably followed by Street. Everything has a really wide feel to it. I don’t know how else to describe it. I really like where you’re going with your stuff, and I look forward to hearing some more!</p>

            <p>Hey Thrashie <img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/c/cd874b800aca640261e80612880021fbd7d4b2d2.jpg?v=5" title=":thrashie:" class="emoji emoji-custom" alt=":thrashie:">,</p>
<p>When you create unique / different / experimental music, it’s probably harder to get positive feedback. Weird can go wrong, but it doesn’t with you. The forum clearly digs your stuff. And so do I. There’s no-one else in the Auxy forum producing anything like Himiko.</p>
<p>One of my fav authors is China Mieville, who writes weird SciFi and your music seems like the musical equivalent. You take strange and unusual ideas and make them appealing for people who may not generally listen to that type of music. Like, Evil under the Floorboard is nasty evil with screaming, but it still sounds appealing somehow. Your artwork’s weird / interesting too.</p>
<p>I don’t even know how you made Street work. But it does.</p>
<p>Wish I’d listen to your Omen tracks sooner. So much innovation, sound variation, atmosphere, musical complexity and energy. It’s also cool that you share your projects for remixing / looking at.</p>
<p>Nice work bro. And thanks for being our 20th Forum Member of The Week.</p>

            <p>whoa there <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/thrashie">@Thrashie</a>! your songs are so amazing! they’re really heavy and original! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>i have zero experience with creating this genre, so i can’t really give a lot of feedback. even if i was, i don’t think any feedback is possible.</p>
<p>i absolutely love your use of samples, and the drums you create sound art of this world. himiko blew my mind.</p>
<p>the teaser collab you did with akyut also was so perfect. like some comments said, it would be perfect for a spooky movie trailer.</p>
<p>the intro in street was outta this world lol. the percussion was also on point.</p>
<p>listened &amp; liked through a couple other songs of yours as well. keep up the awesome work! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I think you are one of the most inspiring creators that enhance Auxy’s possibilities.<br>
When I first listen “The Mariana’s web”, I was so impressed with selection of beautiful and interesting sounds.<br>
Also, just listened to “Mafia”, and I think I  really love this type of well structured and glitching cool songs. Great job!!!<br>
Look forward to your next song <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>PS. Lovely logo btw<br>
PS2. Seems like you really love Japan… if you need any Japanese translations, I’m always  happy to help you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> いつでもどうぞー</p>

I honestly think that it’s impossible to recreate your tracks, which makes you definitely one of the most unique producers on this forum. The automation is crazy. I think I would define your tracks as controlled chaos; there’s so much going on but it still sounds great. Mafia and Himiko are my favorite tracks of yours because these are really some next level tracks. Please continue this style, I’m curious where this will lead you to.<br>
My only bit of feedback, or rather an advice or warning, is to not overdo it, but I’m confident that this won’t happen since you already nail your tracks, so you will only get better <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Keep it up man!</p>

<p>Agreed, his automation work is always impressive. Sometimes there’s… just too much of it xD it makes it so hard to do things with his music sometimes. Trust me… having to recreate all his drum automation from scratch was a pain. This guy, instead of just using an 8 bar scene without a note, used a four bar scene and automated a note out instead. I’m like… why must you torment me x3</p>

<p>In all seriousness, your tracks are seriously interesting. I love how inspiring the first trailer for your album was, Beginnings &amp; Endings. Since then I’ve really enjoyed listening to your music. There’s really nothing I want to criticize either x3</p>
<p>And yes… you use <em>way</em> too many samples.</p>

            <p>So here’s my feedback</p>
<p>—Sheol’s Leviathan: The tension in the intro is pretty good, also nice use of samples. The bass that hits at around 30 seconds fits perfectly, especially with the high tone. That inception-esc noise at 0:47 sounds awesome with the song, maybe used a little too much. but still well placed. Also those vocal samples at 1:02. again, perfect choice. Ominous af. That wonky bass at 1:20 really threw me for a loop, awesome pitch bending on that one. The pause before the drop legit killed me. In real life. I am now dead. Those growls were so PERFECT! The amount of crazy things going on in the drop just makes it so awesome, especially the automation. It’s so well done and so cinematic for a track that’s only 2 minutes long. I’d say without a doubt that drop had some of the best automation I’ve ever heard in an Auxy trap track. 10/10</p>
<p>—<em>Mafia:</em> Some dope horns going on here, love it. Lowpass and pitch automation wraps it all together. And the vocal sample at 0:35… ominous and wierd af, for a second I was going “wtf was that”. Now the drop, not much is to be said other than Holy donut dude. The entire vibe is so swingy and rough and I love it! But the part at 1:10 just wraps it all together, nice rhythm.  After the drop you have a nice ominous buildup, which sets the mood just right for another drop. I’ve no idea how you pulled off the last drop, but all I can say is, again, excellent automation. 9/10</p>
<p>—<em>Himoko:</em> Sick rhythm right at the start, especially with that creepy guitar (i think its a guitar?) The bass is also as toney and growly as frick. Now the drop, couldve used a bit more fill, but i think you fixed that later on. Also perfect placement of those vocal samples., and that horn (i think) sounds on point. Automation is ONCE AGAIN, lit. I love it when stuff starts getting crazy around 2:30. which fixes the fill problem. Later on in the track… 3:03 has to be one of my favorite parts, those kicks are placed perfectly and work so well those bass hits. And then the final drop… those whispery noises duuuude.!!! Nothing else can be said here other then 9/10</p>

            <p>Honestly mate, your stuff is not what I’d normally listen to. But if there’s one thing I can make clear, you do an amazing job at it. I can even say you’ve clearly carved out your own niche in this community. Keep it up, mate.</p>

            <p>I gotta say, I totally dig your stuff. I’m usually not logged in when I listen which is a bummer because I haven’t liked too many of your songs, but seriously, you have a real talent and unique style. Keep it up! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Ive been listening to your stuff for a little while, just whenever I come across it. The FMOTW allowed me to relisten to your stuff and really made me appreciate your mixing skills and amazing ability to make really transient, deep trap.</p>
<p>Your drums on all of the tracks are awesome and really thoughtful. The use of samples is incredible too.</p>
<p>Amazing job on all of your stuff, and I’m really pumped to hear what you come out with in the future.</p>

            <p>Congrats man! I can just tell you put so much time and effort into your music because it sounds like nothing I’ve ever heard before from an Auxy producer. You deserve it!</p>

            <p>I don’t have any specific feedback on specific songs, anything (everything) you post I listen to. One of my favorite producers around these parts, what you do in this app blows my mind. Keep it up man that’s all I gotta say</p>

            <p>no problem ^-^ those two are actually friends of mine from a while back so any publicity for them helps (although they seem pretty established anyways lol) wished i meet Scraton though, almost did. he seems SUPER down to earth from what ive heard from others.<br>
(believe it or not Taps, Vylet, and Scraton are all friends)</p>
