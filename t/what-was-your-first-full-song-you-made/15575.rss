            <p>Thanks, its not really anything to behold but I was proud of it back when it was new. Its too repetitive and simple. Ive never really heard any other song like it tho, its pretty unique</p>

            <p>This is the first full song I’ve ever made, pretty sure I’d had Auxy for like 3 months when I made it. Auxy is the first studio I’ve used, so the song isnt gonna be as good as some of you guys’ first Auxy songs lol. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/isaac-legate/skyscraper">https://soundcloud.com/isaac-legate/skyscraper</a> (Not really sure what genre it is)</p>
