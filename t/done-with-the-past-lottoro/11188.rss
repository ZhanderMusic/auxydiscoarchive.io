            <p>Cool, dark, and very interesting. Some of the notes sounded a bit off to me, and I was expecting a bit more after ‚Äúthis that new sh*t‚Äù, but overall it wasn‚Äôt bad.</p>

            <p>I feel you, thanks for the feedback. It was meant to be bass heavy track but after you said that I see what you mean. That‚Äôs the hardest part for me most of the time is knowing where and when not to be busy on a track</p>

            <p>Haha<br>
The track was cool too<br>
But just a tip for the future‚Ä¶ having more parts without ass much bassüëç<br>
Just to add some breathing room if you know what I mean <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
