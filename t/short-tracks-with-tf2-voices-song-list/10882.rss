    <title>Short tracks with TF2 voices [song list]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/short-tracks-with-tf2-voices-song-list/10882</link>
    <description>I made some short tracks with Team Fortress 2 character quotes and posted on Instagram. All of them are quite short (because those are made for insta post), and I think it’s too short to advertise separately, so I made this list. 
Hope you enjoy the feeling of good old days of TF2 memes.

“Giddy up!”[Bounce] &amp; “Medic’s favorite” [Bounce] https://instagram.com/p/BkM4btFAcgP/

“Miss you rain” [Deep house] https://instagram.com/p/Bkm8ReQAF1j/</description>
