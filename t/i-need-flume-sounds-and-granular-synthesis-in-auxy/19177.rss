            <p>Try messing with offset or free move and play with the spacing of the notes to create that offsetting feel. Hopefully that makes sense. Distortion, chorus are some good tools to manipulate sounds as well</p>

            <p>Sometimes great sounds come out of creating a long arpeggio then messing around with the reverb settings until you get some sort of pad.  I have also tried to do that with the vocal chops and it didnâ€™t sound that bad!</p>

            <p>itâ€™s not hard to recreate those sounds. play around with a lot of the pads and leads, distortion, reverb, lowpass and high-pass</p>
