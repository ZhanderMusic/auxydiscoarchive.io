    <title>Send songs/samples you might want to collab on!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/send-songs-samples-you-might-want-to-collab-on/2591</link>
    <description>I want to take a break from my current songs and work on some new stuff. If anyone has anything that they&#39;d like to see me put my Eswyn twist onto, feel free to send it to me. I won&#39;t post it anywhere without permission, and if you like it, we can do a collab. I feel like this could be a great way to get some practice and make some cool new friends!</description>
