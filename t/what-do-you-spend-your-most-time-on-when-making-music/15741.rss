    <description>When making a track, what’s the main thing you focus on and is most time consuming? 

For me I’d say creating a good melody or chord progression and structuring the track.</description>

            <p>Chords are most important when it comes to making a track, so I focus on that quite often. I also focus on layering the frequencies, panning, and having fluid transitions.  Structuring a track is probably the hardest part for me.</p>

            <p>I will freely admit it’s not all perfection. Part of it is due to working on a huge music project that’s taken <em><strong>WAY</strong></em> too long to get finished, and a lot of that is going into it. The other songs I’m kind of holding out on until that’s finished, as a way to ensure I actually get it done. It’s worked so far and I’m mostly finished, just got a few last touches on some songs and a potential re-record of a few bits but other than that… it’s close to being ready. I’ve finally worked myself back into music making, so that also helps (Remember folks, don’t burn yourself out trying to be perfect. Just make the music you want to hear and it gets better. Learning this the hard way sucks)</p>

            <p>Usually it’s mixing the bass.  But in Auxy I spend most of my time painstakingly moving notes around in the piano roll and then wondering if the lengths are right and if I should go back in and tediously adjust all the note lengths.  But yeah anywhere else, it’s mixing the bass in an almost completed track that just needs better bass</p>
