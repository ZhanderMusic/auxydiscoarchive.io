    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/coeur-by-hayvn-piano/3807</link>
    <description>I thought I&#39;d like to go back to what truly makes me happy - playing piano. So, this song is for my heart - my cœur.

I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>OK, I’ve listened through intently now a couple of times.</p>
<p>Emotionally, it feels optimistic, with a slightly sad edge (through the combination of dominant chords, and how bright you take the notes).</p>
<p>It feels energetic, quite active, due to the tempo and the ‘bassline’.</p>
<p>It moves along at such a pace, that I feel like there’s not enough time to savour some of the chords and melodies in there.</p>
<p>As originally said, I do think it’s a fantastic composition. No question in my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I <em>do</em> still have trouble with it feeling mechanical, though. I couldn’t get past it. The rhythm and the volume/velocities are so regulated, and the notes so tightly packed, that I’m constantly reminded that this isn’t a human playing, but midi playback. And for me, that takes away something special.</p>
<p>If it’s trying to tell a human story, express something human, I wonder if some of it is getting a little lost in translation.</p>

            <p>It’s sometimes difficult for me to listen ‘as a listener’, rather than a maker, analysing the track.<br>
I’ll listen again, as a listener, and let you know. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>The composition of Cœur makes it not possible to be played by just one person. I was just composing it for the sake of composing. And I like to play around with Auxy because it really quickly let’s me create what I have in my head. I can tell you want to help me perfection my craft, but that’s really not what I’m after. The song in itself, the way it sounds, everything was on purpose. Imperfection sometimes holds more beauty than any perfection you can think of. And in the end, I don’t write music for anyone but me. But I appreciate the feedback. I really do. You give feedback to a lot of people, that shows that you’re passionate about this whole thing called music. I do too and I use it as my escape, my way of expressing my feelings.</p>
<p>May I ask you what you felt while listening to Cœur?</p>

            <p>So, that’s a yes? (you could play Cœur by hand - even if you played it in sections?)</p>
<p>Curious to know why you chose Auxy (or any step sequencer), as opposed to (e.g.) a midi keyboard into a DAW or a mic-ed-up piano, and capture the full expressive potential of the piece.</p>
<p>Expressiveness in a performance is one of the signature strengths of piano (and piano pieces). Expressiveness in a performance is a weakness for Auxy.</p>
<p>I’m just going by what I think I’d do if I could could play that well, especially if I was writing piano pieces, which can offer so much more nuance and expressiveness than Auxy can.<br>
(I could quantise it afterwards via the software, if I wanted that style, but I’d still have the organic performance recorded.)</p>

            <p>I’ve been grappling with this myself, as piano was my first instrument and I’m trying to get back to composing for it, though I have to say it’s fun to “play” things on Auxy that I’d never think to (or be able to) in real life.</p>
<p>“Soft” is okay for voicing, but not for phrasing.  Combining volume and/or low-pass filter automation is good for both, and for emulating the soft (left) pedal.  You can hear my attempt at using volume/filter ramps around 5:40-6:15 in this track.  I liked the effect as it is, a bit overdone, but it could be smoothed out more realistically:<br>

<p>The N-piano solution is brilliant, however (overhead notwithstanding)!  And last, but not least, this is a lovely piece!</p>

            <p>I think this is a great composition. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>To follow on from <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yaneeck">@yaneeck</a>’s line of thinking…</p>
<p>The notes feel quite rigid, at the moment, due to the rigid quantisation and lack of variety in note volume levels.<br>
While there’s not much you can do about the quantisation, you could explore using more variety in the note volumes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s the ‘soft note’ option, but two levels is probably not enough for a piano piece.<br>
You might be able to achieve it with volume automation. But if not, try breaking it down into layers of multiple instances of the piano instrument.</p>
<p>Split the piano into two instruments, one at full volume (still using full and soft notes) and another a (e.g.) half volume (still using full and soft notes). This effectively gives you four levels of loudness, which enables you to build more subtlety into the playing style.<br>
Add another instance, and you have six levels, which should be plenty to make it feel more humanised.</p>
<p>Then, it’s just about deciding which parts of the piece you want to add subtlety to. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I’d start by looking at <a href="http://www.edisoft.com/blog/2011/12/13/what-is-a-musical-run/" rel="nofollow noopener">note runs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_(music)" rel="nofollow noopener">trills</a>.</p>
<p>I’d also consider exploring more variety in note length. The whole piece feels very staccato.<br>
It makes it feel like the piano version of a dance track, but maybe that’s the purpose, but I think it might weaken its value as a piano piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[Edit. Didn’t mean to sound as if I was telling you what to do with your music. My comments are just suggestions.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Quick question: Are you able to play this on a piano or, like me, are you able to conceive it and sequence it, but not play it?</p>

            <p>You’re welcome.<br>
In that case you also need to emulate releasing the pedal. Maybe by setting the volume to zero?<br>
Anyway I’m curious about results. Have fun <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
