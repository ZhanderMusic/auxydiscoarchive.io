            <p>The vocal chops are strange, but I’ve made use. It’s easier than adding sound clips post production and I’m lazy so perfect combination I suppose.<br>
I’ve tried using the plucks they’re a bit quiet, more so I’m a little too loud for them, I could try and Tone myself down… hm… that would have to be a whole side project thing, Devoid of Noise sounds strange though.</p>

            <p>We didn’t get an actual drum pack for February. We got the chops instead. No snares, no new kicks, no new claps— that’s what I mean. But still, I’m happy for what we got.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, the plucks are just like February as a month…Short and yet surprisingly sweet.</p>

            <p>If you’re struggling to find a use for these, try infusing them with a more retro-style song. Most retro music makes heavy use of arps instead of chords due to limitations of classic hardware, so they’d probably fit in if you worked hard enough with them.</p>
<p>As for melodic percussion, while I myself have found it hard to use them sometimes, they work wonders when you do find a use for them. Slower, more atmospheric songs is where I tend to get the most bang for my buck with them. Especially with adding hefty delay and reverb to them.</p>

            <p>Oh. Well, now I’m sad because these new sounds will most likely get compartmentalized into the same place Melodic Percussion is in— and that’s currently in the realm of “can’t find much use for these”.</p>

            <p>That’s because, for some of the instruments, tone adds is a spicy Sine-based distortion. It’s very noticeable to the trained ear, and doesn’t always make for juicy sounding chords. It distorts them strongly. If you want an example of another instrument that distorts in this manner, Racer is a good one to compare to. So is Slope, as both use the same type of distortion.</p>
<p>Some of the others add a chorus effect (noticeable in Celery), and some are just simple clipping distortion (the type you’d normally think of when talking about distortion).</p>
<p>Some sounds just aren’t built to make chords, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, more envelope controls won’t help, because the entire pack is made up of samples instead of waveforms generated through Auxy. If you don’t believe me, compare the size of any instrument from Game Waves to the pack. 5-10kb vs 1mb average.</p>
<p>It’s likely the samples aren’t more than just a pluck itself, so more envelope control will have little to no effect on actually sustaining the note out.</p>

            <p>I personally like this months sounds. They sound really great when it comes to “scattered chords” or chords that have a rhythm.</p>

            <p>I dunno. I guess I’m not the type of person to use plucks, because my first thought of a pluck is a sound like Climb, which can open up very dramatically to give a cutting, bright edge to anthem-style chords.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I guess instruments like Climb have spoiled me into thinking that most plucks can open up as well as that instrument.</p>
<p>I’m just a very chords-heavy person… again, having all these nice and full lead sounds have spoiled me. At least I’ll have nice, strong arps for the next couple of tracks…</p>
