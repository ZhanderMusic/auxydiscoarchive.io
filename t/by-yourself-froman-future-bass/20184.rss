            <p>Not my genre, but liking this one.<br>
Particularly like the little cutaway hooks.</p>
<p>I think it might benefit from a bit more work on the mix, possibly a little more time on sound design too, as I think they both take away a little from a track with an otherwise really strong set of ideas and motifs.</p>
<p>I say this a lot, but imo it’s true here too… t’s crying out for a full vocal.<br>
With the right vocal, I think it has the potential to get some serious traction. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
