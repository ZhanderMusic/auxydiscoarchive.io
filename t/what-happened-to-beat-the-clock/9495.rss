    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-happened-to-beat-the-clock/9495</link>
    <description>I am conFUSED! I loved the BTC challenges and I was really hoping for them to continue, but it appears that they just sort of stopped after 25 or so. :confused: Why did they stop? Are they still going on someplace secret? What&#39;s happening?</description>
