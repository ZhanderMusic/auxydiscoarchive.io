    <title>How long should a loop last?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-long-should-a-loop-last/6964</link>
    <description>I feel like I worry too much when it comes to repetition so I&#39;m trying to break out of my comfort zone by writing lengthy songs that are less about seeing how many unique loops I can create and more about enjoying the atmosphere of the song. How can I use repetition to push out the length of a song without getting annoying? Also, how patient are you with the dynamics of a track?</description>

            <p>Repetition can be a good thing. Some song sounds I wish they would keep a section going for a bit longer so I would have to replay it so many times! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>Most times I have used 8 bars. I have used 16 bars once but only for effects. I wanted this long effect on a bassline and I didnt feel like splitting it up so I made it 16 bars and just automated everything else to fit.</p>

            <p>I generally think you can repeat a thing twice in a row but the third times gotta be varied or something else.  Rule of three.  But if you can make even the second time sound a wee bit different, that’s ideal</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t keep things exactly the same for more than 8 bars without some kind of automation or change in general.</p>
<p>(Sorta unrelated but could be helpful) If you go to Varien’s YouTube channel, he has some old segmentes about how to produce tracks and a lot of what goes into his own tracks.</p>

            <p>Nah. Gotta stay open to playing around with alt bar counts.<br>

<p>A recent sketch used a 4+2 bar structure. Good to switch things up.</p>

            <p>It depends on how you’re using your bars, what sort of song you’re writing, and overall how you are choosing to structure your song.</p>

<p>stick to pairs of 2s, 4s, and 8s.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While this is a good rule of thumb, if you’re doing something funky with scenes for effect (such as a 1 bar break or a 3 bar hook for the entire song which is something i’ve done a lot, or even just faking tempo changes using differently sized scenes that are identical in everything other than note length) then go for it. You just need to make sure it doesn’t break stuff (something i’ve done a lot)</p>

<p>Also, how patient are you with the dynamics of a track?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m more patient than most – which is actually to say, that I’ll enjoy a second sweep of a loop, as I’ll be able to pick different things out from the first time. This means I’ll gain a deeper appreciation of the detail and subtlety in the track.</p>
<p>I’m guilty of allowing things to ‘drag on’ more than they sometimes should – but that’s for the same reason above.</p>
<p>That said, even on textural pieces, you should consider introducing small changes at least every 8 bars. Doesn’t have to be dramatic.<br>
The styles I generally work in lend themselves to evolving the sounds, using filtering to add movement.</p>
<p>Of course, one factor is tempo. If you have a particularly slow tempo, south of ~75, then 8 bars can feel like a long time.</p>

            <p>If you want an example of using repetition in atmospheric music (I’m not trying to self-promote, I swear), check out my song <a href="https://soundcloud.com/not_miles/voxel-city">Voxel City</a>. There’s two loops that go on for the entire song and an arp that plays for the majority of it. I kept it interesting by adding automations, adding more loops, and even changing keys.</p>

            <p>If you’re doing an atmospheric track, repetition is fine as long as your foundations are good. If you’re worried about repetitiveness, mess around with the automations and see what comes of it, maybe a slow rise and fall in tone to give it a breathing effect.</p>
<p>I don’t produce atmospheric tracks all to often, if at all, so I really don’t know where to start with advice. Honestly, if it sounds repetitive to you then change it until it doesn’t. Layer instruments. Stuff like that. Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

            <p>Using arpeggios is a great way to use repetition to your advantage. In one section, you can use an arp with certain settings and then later in the song, use the same arp, but change something, like opening the lowpass filter or throwing in some pitch bends</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>At most, I keep my loops to 8 bars long. It’s enough space to have fun with variation and drum-work without it getting dull, and it leaves room to build on top of in the next set of loops. Melodic sections are around 32 bars total (8 for the buildup) and 16 bars total for the drop.</p>
<p>The key is to layer, and introduce more melodies on top of those already present. Not too much of course, but enough to constantly be introducing something new and interesting to the listener.</p>

            <p>I feel like I worry too much when it comes to repetition so I’m trying to break out of my comfort zone by writing lengthy songs that are less about seeing how many unique loops I can create and more about enjoying the atmosphere of the song. How can I use repetition to push out the length of a song without getting annoying? Also, how patient are you with the dynamics of a track?</p>
