    <description>@aUstin_Haga is the auxy producer that I look up to the most, his music quality is outstanding.

Madeon is the non auxy producer that I look up to the most. He got famous when he was around my age and that is unbelievable. 

Who do you look up to?</description>

            <p>Auxy: <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a>, Really good with simplicity and heavy beats<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/austin_haga">@aUstin_Haga</a>, Unique ideas and songs<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/toveii">@Toveii</a>, nice LoFi and challenge entries<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_anderson">@MR_ANDERSON</a>, fat chords and great and unique future bass<br>
Other Producers: Zedd is probably my favourite non auxy producer since he’s really good with harmony and music theory.<br>
My favourite songs that he produced are 5. Funny 4. Happy now 3. Candyman 2. The Middle 1. Stay</p>

            <p>I’m not aiming to be like anyone else, but if I did want to follow in the footsteps of an artist’s/group’s artistry and body of work it would possibly be something like Floating Points or Jaga Jazzist. Elements of multiple genres perfectly fused - and can kill it live.</p>
<p>Floating Points is a particularly good example of an artist who can work authentically across different genres — and tie it all together as a cohesive artistic vision.</p>
<p>I really don’t look at it from the perspective of wanting to emulate someone’s career profile or the size of their fanbase. For me, it begins and ends with the music they make. They’re hugely talented, making interesting music for discerning listeners and are not bothered by trends.</p>
<p>(Of course, I’m a fan of some much larger artists too, but Floating Points and Jaga Jazzist are in the same wheelhouse in terms of the kind of music I’m most interested in making.)</p>
