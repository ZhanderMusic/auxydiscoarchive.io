    <title>Anyone know how to easily export individual instruments to Windows 10 Dell computer?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-know-how-to-easily-export-individual-instruments-to-windows-10-dell-computer/10580</link>
    <description>I want to export individual instruments from a song, and then move that zip file to my computer without quality loss. Using Google Drive or Dropbox results in a quality loss for me. Any ideas?

Also, does anyone know how to open zip files on IPad? I want to edit individual instruments on the Garage Band app. To do so I need to have the zip file opened. gracias</description>

            <p>Note: I meant M4A (which is what the Export Audio produces)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the MP3s are used for Soundcloud?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s daft though.<br>
Auxy offers a direct Export/Upload to Soundcloud option, which uses an uncompressed WAV.</p>
<p>If a user is using SC’s own upload options*, then they could use the uncompressed WAV.<br>
(* Only available on the website, not the SC apps, afaik.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Soundcloud always (re-)rips uploads to 128 kbps regardless of what’s uploaded.<br>
That (re-)rip becomes the file we hear when on the site.</p>
<p>So, it’s far better to upload the better WAV original. Otherwise, it’s like resaving a JPG as a new JPG. That’s two rounds of lossy compression, leaving you with a worse quality final listening file.</p>

</aside>
<p>You could be right. Strange that it’s the first option, as it’s probably used far less commonly than the other options.</p>
<p>Assuming it’s getting used at all (<a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/poll-do-you-export-to-wav-or-m4a/10591/">I created a poll</a>), it would be better if Auxy offered kbps options (‘Low’/128, ‘Medium’/192, ‘High’/320), either in the app settings or as part of the Export Audio process.</p>

            <p>GarageBand’s export menu is the same. Actually, it goes</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Song, Ringtone (rofl) or Project (ok good)</li>
<li>Under Song there are arbitrary “quality” settings (in bit rates which most users aren’t gonna understand, not to mention I have no idea what format this is) and then uncompressed at the very bottom.</li>
</ol>
<p>I <em>suspect</em> it’s for emailing your songs to people? Which is like. I can’t really fathom who is doing that. But hey.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve never used the MP3-based Export Audio.</p>
<p>It strikes me as a little odd that it’s the first audio export offered up, with the others (WAV and WAV stems) offered on a secondary menu. I would have expected the options to be the other way around, with the more useful WAV options being the primary.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m missing something obvious, but in what situation are users commonly outputting MP3s?<br>
(and is that a more commonly used option that the Uncompressed WAV?)</p>
<p>(Unsurprisingly, I think there’s room to improve quite a few of the IA decisions they’ve made in the app.)</p>

            <p>i do this using an app , first i export the zip to an app called “zip &amp; RAR file extractor” and then once the file is in the app, go back to the main screen, theres an option called wifi transfer. the app will show you a custom link that you can type directly in your laptop’s browser to access, add, or download the files you have within the app. your laptop and phone should be on the same wifi network. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I would personally recommend mega.nz, as Dropbox quickly fills up with the measly 2gb they provide you for storage. A single project’s stems can range anywhere from 130MB for an average song to upwards of 260MB <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rainbrothrash/thrashie-ee-ceres">(the 6 minute collab I did with Thrashie)</a></p>

            <p>Exported individual instrument ‘stems’ are the same quality WAV format as used for exporting the entire track as an uncompressed WAV - 16 bit, 44,100 Hz.<br>
However, the mastering that’s applied to them during playback or when exporting the track as a single file is removed.<br>
So, they will sound slightly different as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/NickElle">@NickElle</a>, you’re aware you can export the track as an uncompressed WAV, right (not just as an MP3)?</p>
<p>The Export Audio option creates an MP3, but Export Uncompressed WAV is an option on the ‘More’ screen.</p>

            <p>They are different.<br>
They are actually lower quality than if you export individually.<br>
If you just export the audio, it just exports as a lossy file (either MP3, or m4a), and as we all know, MP3 SUCKS.</p>

<p>I don’t see how that’s possible.<br>
The WAV files are captured inside the zip file. There shouldn’t be any alterations to the zip compression when moving it from the iPhone/iPad to other storage. It should be lossless compression from end to end.</p>
