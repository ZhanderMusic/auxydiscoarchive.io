    <title>Gangstalking/Spinning/Full Stop - Hern [Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/gangstalking-spinning-full-stop-hern-experimental/17298</link>
    <description>3 new tracks from my upcoming album &quot;The Hum.&quot; The theme of the album is sort of like a bad trip mixed with a bit of paranoia and schizophrenia added in to the mix. It&#39;s an abrasive and eclectic mix of sounds and styles meant to put you in a terrifying situation where you have no idea what the hell is going on, who is watching you, and where you&#39;re going.

Anyway, link is here:
