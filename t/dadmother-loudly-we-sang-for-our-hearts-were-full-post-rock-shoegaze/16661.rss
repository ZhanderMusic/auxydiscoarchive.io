    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dadmother-loudly-we-sang-for-our-hearts-were-full-post-rock-shoegaze/16661</link>
    <description>This is a very special piece that I wrote for my wonderful wife. I wanted to try and capture the emotions that run through me when I think of her, from little tender moments to overwhelming bouts of passion. Thank you for listening, and I hope you enjoy.
This is [Loudly We Sang, For Our Hearts Were Full](https://soundcloud.com/dadmother/loudly-we-sang-for-our-hearts-were-full/s-Rkb1P)

            <p>Hey I get it, when we do passion projects and get little validation it’s frustrating to say the least.

You’re uniquely technical and it’s nice to hear what you want to make not what you think others want to hear.</p>

            <p>On point, gorgeous setting and perfect pacing. I do very much like the calm build up and powerful finish. A work of passion and it shows. Exquisite track <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand/2.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:t2:"></p>
