            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>That remix is a masterpiece. Brought me back to 2012 when I first got introduced to Armin van Buuren. Thank you.</p>
<p>there’ll be two uploads:</p>
<p>David Naha - Homework (Tom Sommerson Remix)<br>
an epic remix</p>
<p>David Naha - Homework (Tom Sommerson vs. David Naha Remix)<br>
the one I messed up</p>
<p>you’re awesome, look forward to hear and create cool, resonating sounds together as well!</p>
<p>David</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was experimenting yesterday and came up with few extra loops as well, and the more I do, it gets more nostalgic (to me). Gets better though! there’s also a project file by Tom (scroll up) that I will be checking out as soon as possible. Am certain that it’ll be a major insight booster as well.</p>

            <p>Hi David!</p>
<p>I did my homework… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sunglasses.png?v=6" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"><br>
I started to play with your track in Auxy on yesterday evening, and here is the result:<br>
<a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/IUrABjPHVTwEsoau8Crz8A==" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/IUrABjPHVTwEsoau8Crz8A==</a></p>
<p>I left your melodic patterns, just a little bit extended the bass line melody.<br>
I hope you’ll like it. I can’t upload to Soundcloud because my upload time is over…</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Tom</p>

            <p>Has loads of potential melodically, but very repetitive even for a one minute song.</p>
<p>Another problem (as pointed out by god himself, Nick Elle) is that the kick is devoured by the bassline. It’s not because the bass is too loud but the kick is too quiet.</p>
