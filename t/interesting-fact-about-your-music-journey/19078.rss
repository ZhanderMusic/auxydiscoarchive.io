    <title>Interesting fact about your music journey?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/interesting-fact-about-your-music-journey/19078</link>
    <description>Hello all! Indirect here, hope all is going well for you. Thought I’d take minute and ask... what is one interesting fact about your music journey that not many people know about? 

For me, something not many people know or remember is my “Suit Rebranding”... I decided to take things more seriously and draw my own logo, and officially made the logo public on September 8, 2017. The logo looked like a little suit... ![image|666x500](upload://h7Th9vO3WpEKHd6PEYq5OofNcsU.jpeg) 
This was my first attempt at anything like this, and it initially got me really motivated to reach out and do more... This logo isn’t used anymore but it led to a much more broad name and brand... getting me an “I” emoji :indir3ct: and the nickname Indi. 

[spoiler]Another fun fact.. I recently got a puppy and the shelter I got him from was calling him &quot;ND&quot; for new dog... so I just migrated over to the name Indie since it sounds similar. Im even branding my dog here y&#39;all :stuck_out_tongue:Just kidding just kidding [/spoiler]

What is some interesting fact about your music journey?</description>

            <p>It all started as a coping mechanism after a death near to me. It later morphed into a need to make something that is minimally influenced by any genre or individual. I actually started fully analog with an Ms20 mini and a bunch of volcas under my other alias “devoid of hope”. But got auxy on a whim to have something to quickly play with sound design like a sound sketchbook of sorts. I started making a lot of stuff with auxy so I started this alias. Fun fact about non-influened music, nobody likes it hahaha, I’m my biggest fan.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My musical journey started a little while after i moved to FL, I started with an app, that i cant remember the name of at the moment (it was NOIZ). my first alias was evidence that i was about 10…Yolomaster21…i had no idea what it meant but still used it for some reason. but about a month after i joined the app, it started dying and now the whole thing is shut down, so my first songs are now lost forever.</p>
<p>During those days i also started using Music Maker Jam (MMJ) under the name Comical Cosine (Some of my gamer tag) but then i thought of HAZE, which i then used for most of my “Career”, which moved from MMJ to Medly, my first true DAW. I hate most of those songs, but for Medly trial tunes, they arent that bad. In HAZE’s last months i tried using the FL Trial, but I put HAZE on hold a few months ago due to it slowly dying.</p>
<p>While trying to keep HAZE afloat, I found Auxy, i thought I could make a second alias (Now S.A.) which used my initials, C.M. But while making the logo, i somehow made the M look like a stylized A, so I used C.A. for 3 songs, but changed it later to S.A.</p>
<p>S.A. is the initials of a character I created for a RP group on Minecraft, it allowed me to escape reality for a few hours and exist in this insane world of other beings. Thats where I created Sam Anderson, a Northern Irish psychopath normally made as a gay character, he helped me distract myself from the world around me, so i renamed myself to S.A. and created music for others.</p>
<p>Sorry this is extremely long, but i felt like it was the best way to tell this story<br>
Cheers!</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[OIL]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I been making little songs for ages. Was taught to beatbox by a homeless man we took in and sheltered until he could get back on his feet when I was eight and I haven’t shut up since then. Then, in about 2014, I discovered Playground, which is a pretty dope organic remix app. I eventually won a competition held by the creators of said app so that I could get all the maps there for free, and even later on one of my renditions of a beatmap was shown to the guy who made the original track (he’d done stuff for artists like Nelly). In 2015, I start playing the drums after being inspired by anime drum covers on YouTube. There was also a toaster bath attempt.</p>
<p>That was… yeah.</p>
<p>I kept working on and honing the music I made until it was decent enough to release in about late 2016, early 2017. I at first went for the name “putty”, cause I didn’t initially think I had a style or anything, then “silic”, because technology and it sounds like “slick”, and from there “OIL” became a thing. I liked the acronyms that FOOL (F*** Our Ordinary Lives) and IYFFE (In Your Face F*** Everything) used, so I wanted to make a meaningful acronym of my own. Drawing on my 2015 experience, I decided that the name would be “Okay, I’ll Live”. Or OIL, for short.</p>
<p>I’ve since gone into Sound Tech, and I’m slowly building up my home studio.</p>
<p>I know this was more the whole journey instead of like, a little fun fact about it, but… there’s a lot to remember, I suppose. Thanks for reading.</p>

            <p>I used a music app called launchpad, very limited amount of loops and i was only in my very early teen years. I would always listen to these loops and wish i could make my own or try get them combining with others (which wasn’t possible with that app like 7 years ago)</p>
<p>I never had any good money or software to get anything more advanced like fl studio but over quarantine i found Auxy and i managed to upload my first track a few months after learning it, just stuck with it since.</p>
<p>Honestly i have no background or any educational knowledge about music production except playing a cello from grade/year 7 days😂</p>

            <p>I started out making music at 14, and quickly got good at it. I took it up because I had to do something to get my mind off being bullied, and as my musical tastes evolved from trap and future bass to complextro, my style did too. I also have an older brother (22 years older than me, to be exact) who also does music, although he plays alternative rock.</p>

            <p>My music journey started out in quarantine. I have had auxy for a year but never really understood what I could use it for. Then the coronavirus happened. During quarantine I started messing around with auxy until I could make a decent song. I’ve been using auxy for four months now, I think, and released my first song on SoundCloud a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Anyways that’s my music journey. It’s not that interesting but it got me to where I am today😄</p>

            <p>I originally started out as a duo three years ago in highschool with a friends of mine. However we never really made a song together and eventually stopped making music for two years. I then rebranded after the two years to what I am now. I also had no clue there were Auxy servers/ discord til this year</p>

            <p>Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the “color” of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses”. I believe this is what you looking for…(yes I know I’m hilarious)</p>

            <p>Ay I have the same story except it took me only a year. I think the discord you’re talking about I’ve joined before but they kicked me out due to not being a certain age. It’s called “The Melody Society” because the owner thought there was gonna be legal issues when the name Medly was in the title (it was safe to put it in the title) I don’t know how it is now but yeah</p>
