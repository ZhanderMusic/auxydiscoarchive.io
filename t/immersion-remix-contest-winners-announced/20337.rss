    <title>Immersion Remix Contest (Winners announced)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/immersion-remix-contest-winners-announced/20337</link>
    <description>So my latest track ‘Immersion’ has done extremely well on my YouTube (when compared to my other tracks) so I wanna open the project up and allow others to Remix it.

Details:

- Depending on how many remixes I receive, I’m looking for maybe 3 winners.

- The more creative you are with the Remix (example: changing the genre or mood of the track) the more likely it will be chosen.

- Winning remixes will be uploaded to my channel and full credit will be given to winners with whatever links/socials they want promoted.

- Deadline will be November 30th

- You may upload your version to Soundcloud as long as you make it clear it is a remix.

Hope to see some creative remixes!

            <p>I have reviewed each submission and I love the creativity in each one, you all brought something unique. But I can only choose 3 winners:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/the_osprey">@The_Osprey</a> - I love the way you reinvented the melody and added some new sounds!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/ama">@AMA</a>  - Such a creative use of orchestral instruments I haven’t really heard before!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/benvacca">@BenVacca</a> - Amazing mixing and I love the darker tone you gave to the track!</p>
<p>Could the 3 winners add me on Discord at Octave#9752 or alternatively just send me a DM on Auxy if you don’t use Discord. I would like to speak with you.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to everyone who participated.</p>

            <p>I know I don’t run this contest, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/octave">@Octave</a>, but if I had to pick the 3 winners in my book, they’d be <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/benvacca">@BenVacca</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/the_osprey">@The_Osprey</a>, and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/ama">@AMA</a>. Although I loved all the remixes, theirs were the best in my opinion.</p>
