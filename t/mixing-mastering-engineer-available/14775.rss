    <title>Mixing/ Mastering Engineer Available</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mixing-mastering-engineer-available/14775</link>
    <description>It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been active here sorry about that.  I made this post for anybody who is looking for a mixing and/or mastering engineer for any of their projects.  I am available and more than happy to work with you!  I would only charge a very affordable amount (a couple dollars if anything at all) and provide you with a nice sounding mix and I‚Äôll even continue to work and make changes if you don‚Äôt like any of the work I‚Äôve done.  In case you‚Äôre wondering how credible I am to fill this position I study audio engineering in college (specifically in mixing and mastering but mostly mixing) and I mix and master all of my own tracks.  If you have anything you would like me to work on let me know! üòÅ

Edit:
It doesn‚Äôt have to be music.  If you or somebody you know is working on an Ad I am also able to work on the audio for that as well.</description>
