    <title>What two sounds combine good to create one lead?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-two-sounds-combine-good-to-create-one-lead/3556</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve ran into a bit of a creative block with most of my Auxy projects, and I find that the problem is that I run out of good sounds to use. A workaround I&#39;ve discovered for this is to use two sounds with the same loops to create one, different sound. The problem is that I&#39;m not quite finding what I&#39;m looking for, which is a lead that would fit well for a trance track (I am trying to create trance music since it is one of my favorite genres). 

**TLDR: Has anybody else found any good combinations of sounds to create a solid (but not bombastic) lead that would fit well for trance music?**</description>

I used Gossip and a Toned out Stress for my leads in Numb to the Core, which turned out annoying and awesome at the same time.<br>
I made the bass slope sound awesome with a lot of things as well.</p>
