    <description>Could we have an _official_ roadmap post or website? If there is already one, please share it. Otherwise I’ve picked up here and there a few things but a centralized location would be great!</description>

            <p>I’d certainly be interested to hear if there are plans to expand the team.</p>
<p>There are stacks of great feature requests coming in, that hint at where the app could go, but which would only really be achievable if the team was to grow.</p>
<p>If that’s something the team might look into, and a second work-stream could open up, maybe prioritise that one on features that directly generate income. And yeah, I’m talking about open soundpack submissions and a marketplace. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I think what you’ve created is incredible, but I’m also not averse to paying for additional features.<br>
(I don’t understand how some here ‘complain’ about the price of soundpacks. A soundpack for the price of a coffee or two. More than reasonable, imo.)</p>
<p>I would consider finding a way to release/sell the soundpacks on other platforms too. The quality is generally very high and I can certainly imagine creators wanting to play with them in other DAWs.<br>
(Depends on the license agreement made with the creators, but it’s a model worth looking into, imo.)</p>
<p>Not suggesting being all-things-to-all-people, but a reasoned expansion into related output/revenue streams.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, enough for now. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
