    <title>Tar Filled Veins - Hern [Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/tar-filled-veins-hern-experimental/20229</link>
    <description>New single from my upcoming EP, Reflection. This one mostly features samples of myself, though there is also a sample of the intro to Sour Apple by the band Dope Body (great band btw) featured prominently throughout the track.

Hope you enjoy, constructive criticism is welcome as always.</description>
