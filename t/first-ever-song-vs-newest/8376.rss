    <title>First ever song vs newest</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/first-ever-song-vs-newest/8376</link>
    <description>What is the first song you ever made in auxy and your most recent one. I made motherboard about a year ago and it’s pretty bad. https://soundcloud.com/dubby-dubstep-1/motherboard
I actually made it as DubbyD
My most recent one DEEP is better in my opinion. I made a ton of progress in a year. Imagine how good I’d be next year. https://soundcloud.com/dubby-dubstep-1/deep

I want to here your first auxy track and your most recent one to see how much you improved.</description>
