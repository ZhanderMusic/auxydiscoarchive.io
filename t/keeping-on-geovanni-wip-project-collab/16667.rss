    <title>Keeping On - Geovanni [WIP, Project, Collab?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/keeping-on-geovanni-wip-project-collab/16667</link>
    <description>Hey producers:

The name of this song I have is called “keeping up,” but I’m having a good problem trying to bring it to life. I made these sounds and sequences all random and in this track I was looking to deviate this particular song between hiphop and disco.

 I was going for a song like Tyler The Creators “I think” or Kanye Wests “Stronger” 

You can add and edit and remove sounds as you&#39;d like! Thank you! 
Geovanni.

            <p>Thank you for replying and sharing your idea and Ooh man this sounds very cutting edge. It does reside in a disco/house type of light with a side of pop. When I slowed it down to 100-110bpm, it really transported me to writing rnb lyrics. When I set it back to its original tempo, it became a classic dance track. I like it a lot and I’ll see what I can do with it.</p>
