    <description>Feel like there’s something off about this drop, but I can’t put my finger on it. Anyone have an idea what’s wrong with it?

            <p>For me, during the buildup, there was not very much buildup or tension. Not much progression or swell imo. Try making more dynamic contrast before the drop. Then the drop hit and it didn’t really feel like much changed. It was the same melody, same chords, and same rhythm. That’s probably the other main place where it’s missing something.<br>
However it’s not bad, just keep working on it!</p>

            <p>The only thing i would do is turn the bass and melody up a bit, and try to move the chords to fit nicer in the mix. They feel like they come a tiny bit too early every time. Just my thoughts.</p>

            <p>I think it would sound nice if you added a bass drum or low punchy sound right after the snare is done in the build-up, so that the silence doesn’t seem out of place.</p>

            <p>Yeah, more variation would work probably. As for the snare, I’m pretty happy with it already.</p>

            <p>things <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/viiitality">@viiitality</a> would do:</p>
<ul>
<li>add more variation, percussion and melody-wise</li>
<li>punchier snare, achieved by layering multiple snares</li>
<li>more tension in the buildup, achieved by more variation and a bit of automation</li>
</ul>
<p>hope this kinda helped <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
