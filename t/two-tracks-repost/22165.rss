Got loads of plans for music in the future containing multiple genres but I’m also just tryna keep things different.

Been messing about with music instead of making things i could be releasing so i will be trying to step up my game.

My focus will be based around alternative, trap, dnb, breakcore, hardcore, dub, whatever i feel like doing really.

Definitely would love to make soundtracks for video games eventually though.</description>
