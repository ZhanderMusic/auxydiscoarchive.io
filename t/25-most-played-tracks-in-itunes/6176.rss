    <title>25 most played tracks in iTunes</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/25-most-played-tracks-in-itunes/6176</link>
    <description>So, since Auxy is only available for iOS devices, probably everyone on this forum has iTunes. 
There is an automatic playlist in iTunes for your 25 most played tracks, and I was wondering which tracks are among your 25 most played.
NOTE: I know that the iTunes player isn&#39;t as relevant anymore because of Spotify and Soundcloud, but it still seems fun to me..

This is my list:

I guess I like bigroom lol. Some of these tracks really are my alltime favorites.
What are yours?</description>

These are screenshots from my phone. They may not be 100% accurate to how much I play these songs, which is a lot <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/25-most-played-tracks-in-itunes/6176/4">(click for more details)</a>
<p>I am not the least bit surprised by this, to be honest. The six classical pieces are in a playlist I play on repeat to help with insomnia after working a late shift. The rest… FALLOUTBOYFALLOUTBOYFALLOUTBOY. I don’t have an obsession I swear xD</p>
