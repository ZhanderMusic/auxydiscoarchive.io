    <title>What was the first project you created in Auxy?</title>

    <description>Auxy&#39;s iOS revision came out in June 2016.
Curious to see what your guys&#39;s first project sounds like. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much people grow in Auxy.

Here&#39;s mine

_First song that&#39;s posted with iPhone Auxy was this:_

            <p>I was messing with the original auxy as well as the current version for the longest of time but I never ended up making a project or song from it, except about 6 or 7 months ago I created what was probably my first song to ever be ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù in Auxy, this was when there were only two soundpacks. I hadn‚Äôt published it to soundcloud until now as it was rather‚Ä¶ bad in my opinion.<br>

<p>However, looking back at the song now I remixed it. Since it was before automations, I used it to clean up parts of the song and added in another part or two to it, increased the tempo and raised the pitch a half step. Overall I feel it is much better now.<br>

<p>Not even sure why I had called it TW in the first place, but looking through my dropbox that was the name it was under so I just stuck with that. xD</p>

            <p>the very first song I made, I took a lot from the auxy demo. I tried to make it a loop, but auxy doesnt support that so I just gave up.</p>

<p>a little bit afterwards I remade it into a full song with a climax and a lead up. 2 minutes is a full song to me for some reason, it‚Äôs a habit.</p>

<p>I had composed around 6-7 years ago but the recording was on an electric guitar and a drum machine. Then, I discovered the app and decided to give it a go on Auxy.</p>
<p>This is the original track<br>

            <p>However, that was not the first. The first was on the very old version of Auxy on the iPad. You know, the one with only 4 instruments max in your song and you had to record live beats? Yeah that one. It was a cover of Megalovania from Undertale, and it sounded like absolute garbage. It‚Äôs long gone now, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see it again.</p>
