    <title>What genre would you call this?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-genre-would-you-call-this/20212</link>
    <description>Saw someone post a similar question on here, and I thought it was a great idea. I’ve been dying to know how you guys would label this:

You’d think since I made it I would know how to label it, lol, but I’m actually not well versed when it comes to electronic music. I haven’t been making it long. I come from a more “rock” background - playing in a bands and such :slight_smile: 

Thanks you guys! :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I like bitpop. I think that fits.</p>
<p>Do you think straying from a defined genre is a good thing? Like, it sets one apart?</p>
<p>Or do you think fitting into a clear genre is better? I know the mind is compelled to categorize, and I know it’s possibly better for tags/search results and whatnot.</p>

            <p>From an Electronic perspective, not sure if it belongs in a defined sub-genre.</p>
<p>I think simply Electronic would cover it.</p>
<p>I wanna throw Pop and Chiptune in as additional influences (not sub-genres), but that might mostly be bc it catches those vibe in certain parts.</p>
