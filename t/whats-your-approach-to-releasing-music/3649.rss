    <title>Whats your approach to releasing music?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/whats-your-approach-to-releasing-music/3649</link>
    <description>Hi Guys! Hope you are all doing good!

I was wondering how you all go about releasing music. I&#39;m fairly new to Auxy and at the moment I&#39;ve got 4 songs fully finished and I aim to be at about 7 before I start releasing anything so I can be consistent with putting music out there. Now, I&#39;m in two minds of how I should go about this. My first initial thought was to keep releasing singles like every week or so and try to build a following but then I also thought It might be a good idea to put out an EP and maybe release 2 singles from that EP beforehand.  

Any advice would be highly appreciated!

Thanks

            <p>I don’t usually go on a schedule. Releasing something when it is ready will do you better than releasing when you have to. Of course, setting a goal or a plan is good, but I’d advise to only release a track when you believe that it is ready to release.</p>

            <p>If your soundcloud is private you aren’t gonna get noticed and not many people really hear your music. I suggest not making anything private. Let yourself get noticed out there in the wild! I’ve been doing this for 4 years and I’m only at 61 followers by only this month have I actually started boosting. The last ten days I’ve jumped from 42 to 61. So don’t be afraid. Just edit your profile and add your aoundcloud when your ready!!!</p>

<p>I’ve got tracks ready but I haven’t released anything, if I set the track as private and sent the link to you would that allow you to play it, I know you can do that with YouTube but I’m not sure about soundcloud <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

<p>I’m glad you guys mentioned this cause that’s another thing I was curious about, I’ve done a couple of test uploads to SoundCloud to see how it sounded and I couldn’t  hear a massive difference. But I’d rather get the best possible quality uploaded</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dontpartywithguns">@DontPartyWithGuns</a> if I upload an uncompressed WAV to soundcloud would it not still compress it and give me the same result as doing it directly from Auxy?</p>

I’m not sure how loud(in lufs) Auxy exports track at, but thankfully most streaming platforms play all song at the same lufs levels. It’s a real pain trying to make a track as loud as every other track out there without distorting.</p>

Not what I mean, but if it you plan on getting your project mastered then it’s best to export uncompressed(which I’m assuming is .wav). Now it’s not necessary to export wav if you’re only going to upload it to a streaming platform, since (to my knowledge) I don’t know any who are streaming wave files. MP3 as I know of, only takes out inaudible information from the high &amp; low ends. With that said, in a blind test, most people cannot tell the difference between mp3 and wav. Not only are the average person’s ear not sensitive enough to pick up the subtle differences, but they are always (likely) listening to it on cheap sound system(computer speaks, iPhone earplugs, etc.) Now if you’re a 20+ year pro mix master in a treated studio with $5k+ monitors… then maybe a difference can be heard.</p>

            <p>It will convert if you upload WAV or AAC or something, though its compression is a problem. Of course, it’s hosting tons of music and has hardly any money so whatever, you can’t expect perfection.</p>

            <p>Its not converting it its <em>compressing</em> it. Basically, when its compressed it compresses it into a bitrate that is usually lower than listening to it as a project. And so it crunches it into this bitrate which (most times) ends up making hi hats sound a little distorted and basically just makes the project not as good. Whereas, uncompressed will export it exactly how you hear it as a project.</p>

I thought most if not all streaming platforms convert the audio of uploaded files. For example SoundCloud will convert uploaded files into mp3.</p>

            <p>I have a release schedule now. Wow, can you believe that. I used to upload whenever I had something good, and maybe a couple times I’d delete it. I release every month or so, and prepare by pre-uploading to Spotify and pre-monetizing so all the platforms will be uploaded at the same day and so I can earn money from the start. Then I promote like crazy, and I try to end up having as many plays as I would if Auxy ever reposted my music.</p>

            <p>Id do everything the people above me suggested. But don’t upload directly to Soundcloud from Auxy. If you export it uncompressed (in more export options), send it to yourself, and then upload it on a computer (or whatever you upload from idk). It will have a better audio quality that way.</p>

            <p>I would upload a new track every week or every 2 weeks, or maybe switch between 1 and 2 weeks. That way you can line up your tracks for release. And a steady upload schedule is good for promotion. Also, at some point you’re probably going to have a lack of time or a lack of inspiration. By having a few tracks ready you can still upload in these periods. I made the mistake of uploading something every week, causing me to have no tracks at some point.</p>

            <p>Thanks man! Putting out each song as a single might be a good idea as I don’t really have anyone following me right now.</p>

            <p>Maybe release the singles a month and then two weeks before the EP if you go for the EP<br>
Or you could release each song as a single like some people do with their EPs - so different times</p>

            <p>Hi Guys! Hope you are all doing good!</p>
<p>I was wondering how you all go about releasing music. I’m fairly new to Auxy and at the moment I’ve got 4 songs fully finished and I aim to be at about 7 before I start releasing anything so I can be consistent with putting music out there. Now, I’m in two minds of how I should go about this. My first initial thought was to keep releasing singles like every week or so and try to build a following but then I also thought It might be a good idea to put out an EP and maybe release 2 singles from that EP beforehand.</p>
<p>Any advice would be highly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>TMÄR</p>
