    <title>Can I put a remixed song in an album?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/can-i-put-a-remixed-song-in-an-album/10388</link>
    <description>Hey guys, recently a subscriber sent me a project which I hadn’t known was originally @Otzsil stratosphere’s chords, he’d changed the sound and I had no idea as I hadn’t heard the song before. I had started working on t and was going to make it a collab with him. Another subscriber/follower @Matik said to me it was stratosphere, so now I’ve gotta ask  @Otzsil for permission to use it.

Anyway, that’s just the story behind that. What I was asking is, can I use that Remix in my “shatter” album?</description>

            <p>I suggest maybe releasing at as a sort of “bonus track” with the album rather than as a core song.</p>

            <p>Yeah I’ve messaged him asking if I can Remix it. I’m hoping he says yes… as it’s gonna really let me down if he says no because I’d already started working on it before I was told it was otszils chords… but yeah. I’ll wait.  Do you know if he’s active much btw?</p>

            <p>Assuming you have permission from Otzil, it’s worth putting up on SC as a single using the standard remix titling, etc…</p>
<p>(You shouldn’t release it at all, even on SC, if you don’t have permission from Otzil.)</p>
<p>It’s also worth bumping Otzil to see if s/he/they would want to include it on one of their own album releases.</p>

<p>Remixes are normally released under the original artist’s name, not by the remixer themselves.</p>

            <p>Thanks! I think the style is original, because it’s not an intended remix it sounds completely different to what the original song is.</p>

            <p>Good question. I think you could, but in my opinion, it would ruin the meaning of “album,” I think everything should be original.<br>
But it’s your desicion</p>

            <p>Hey guys, recently a subscriber sent me a project which I hadn’t known was originally <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/otzsil">@Otzsil</a> stratosphere’s chords, he’d changed the sound and I had no idea as I hadn’t heard the song before. I had started working on t and was going to make it a collab with him. Another subscriber/follower <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/matik">@Matik</a> said to me it was stratosphere, so now I’ve gotta ask  <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/otzsil">@Otzsil</a> for permission to use it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s just the story behind that. What I was asking is, can I use that Remix in my “shatter” album?</p>
