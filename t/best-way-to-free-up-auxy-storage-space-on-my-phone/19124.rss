    <title>Best way to free up Auxy storage space on my phone?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/best-way-to-free-up-auxy-storage-space-on-my-phone/19124</link>
    <description>I’ve been using Auxy for about 4 years. 
Thus, I have quite a few tracks. 
8 GB worth actually. 
Auxy takes up more space than anything else on my phone - by far. 

What’s the best way to free up space besides the obvious - deleting tracks? 

I’ve found several Auxy files for the same project under the “files”  folder on my phone. 
Can these be deleted? 

Thanks!</description>

            <p>I think deleting the projects that you don’t use or no sounds or drums in it. Also maybe go with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/azureonyx">@AzureOnyx</a>’s choice.</p>

            <p>Other than exported tracks, your instruments/samples take up space too. Delete the instruments/samples you rarely use by swiping them to the left. If there’s a pack you don’t use, use can use the same gesture</p>

            <p>Do you have a shed load of track renders? I suspect those will be taking up the most amount of space since the actual project files are very small</p>
