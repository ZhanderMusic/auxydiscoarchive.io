    <description>What was the hardest song you made? For me, it is Ekstrak - Chaos.( https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/ekstrak-chaos )Not only it was my first trak, but it was also the hardest, since I suck at making EDM it Electro House music. Now, I want to hear yours!</description>

            <p>Probably Sulfur Caves. The music bit wasn’t too difficult, but I think it was the only song that I’ve made that was physically demanding. I spent 8 hours straight making that song. I got <em>way</em> to into it and I forgot to eat. By hour 7, I started feeling woozy and ridiculously tired. I could barely get out of my chair when I finally did decide to go eat, because I couldn’t focus anymore.</p>

            <p>Hate to paraphrase a lot of people…but, all of them. Hard to start a good song, but once I finally get on a roll it gets easier. That’s why I like colabs.</p>

            <p>Oh wow… well… the hardest track I’ve ever made was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/refragmented" rel="nofollow noopener">Re/Fragmented.</a> In terms of time, this song has been undergoing revisions and changes for over six months, on and off, and a total of five (yes five) different versions being posted at one point or another! I still have the crappy original cover art I did using Microsoft Word even, before I adopted my signature blurring style. <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/re-fragmented-remix-contest/4354?u=therealjfalc">There’s also a remix contest currently for this track, as I do feel it’s currently the best work I’ve put out to date.</a></p>
<p>But, in terms of frustration and almost giving up, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/produk-singularity-james-luciens-epic-mix" rel="nofollow noopener">the remix of Produk’s Singularity was easily the most frustrating to make, as I nearly gave up on five or six separate occasions.</a> It was just so foreign to work with something I’ve never really done in my songs, so it became much more difficult than I had imagined.</p>

            <p>i’ve only had times where i usually give up on tracks and rework them in a month or so… f l u i d… was probably hard to make, since there was no automations at the time, it would be hard organizing the track.</p>

<p>Includes a 32-bar, jazzy solo.</p>
<p>While it’s not a complex piece overall, I wanted to create something that wasn’t a sequence of slightly varying loops. (No judgment. I make those kind of tracks too.)</p>
<p>This track was my first attempt at including a ‘solo’. I’m much more familiar and comfortable working that way now.</p>
