This is the pretty much finished first track of an ep I’m trying to finish up by the end of the year. I’m pretty happy with it but would appreciate any feedback/criticism before I declare it finished

Also please don’t edit the track directly just tell me what the criticism is I want to make it 100% myself still</description>

            <p>The only problem with it is the bass and the lead here are ‘clashing’. If you listen to it you will know what I’m talking about. I recommend putting the bass and the lead into two different instruments.<br>
Other than that it’s really cool!<br>
