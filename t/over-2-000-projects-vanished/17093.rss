    <title>Over 2,000 Projects Vanished?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/over-2-000-projects-vanished/17093</link>
    <description>So just out of the blue all my projects stopped working. First I had to reselect all the sounds in the project I was working on, and then when I went to open other projects they wouldn&#39;t load. And then all the previews for the projects vanished and all projects ask me to load a backup. When I go to my files app, I still have the majority of these projects downloaded, but seemingly Auxy can&#39;t load them.

Edit: Upon a closer look, I am actually missing some of the files. I only have backups for some of them.

Edit 2: Upon shutting down my iPad and turning it back on, my projects are loading again. But the glitch was still somewhat bizarre, so I thought I would keep this post up in case it could be useful.

Edit 3: And five minutes later they&#39;ve disappeared again. 

Edit 4: Projects have returned once more but I&#39;m missing some.

            <p>Definitely email <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a> as well, I recall the devs saying this is the preferred way of handling support issues since from within the app it also generates a log file.</p>
