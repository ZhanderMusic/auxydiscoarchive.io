    <title>LootyTV is claiming Auxy Intro as their own work</title>

    <description>LootyTV - Glow:
https://www.shazam.com/amp/track/536587545/glow

Sounds a lot like the Auxy Intro, right? I uploaded a video with an extended version of the Auxy Intro I made, giving credit to Auxy for the original soundtrack. But I got a copyright claim from YouTube saying that I used the song Glow by LootyTV. People in the replies have been saying that Glow is a ripoff of Auxy Intro, so I think @Auxy should handle this.</description>

            <p>I mean I’m pretty sure Auxy would make an intro project knowing that people will remix and use it, so I don’t think they’d put copyright claims over it.</p>
<p>People may well make their own songs from it, and in this case, might put rights for those songs</p>

</aside>
<p>Indeed. I checked Austin’ SC.</p>
<p>Imo, my comments still stands though. It’s a decent track, but primitive (and, imo, yes, a bit twee and cheesy) in a way that could make Auxy seem like it’s only suited to basic productions, rather than showing more of what Auxy is actually capable of.</p>
<p>Yes, I know Austin is considered one of the top tier Auxy users, but that piece is primitive (not in a good way for this way) even by his own standards. There are many Auxy tracks I’d consider as better suited at showcasing Auxy’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Not sure if Auxy have simply been using that for yonks and simply haven’t ever updated it. I’d say it’s time.</p>

            <p>Bro that’s just some random who wanted to use Auxy but was too lazy to actually wrote an original song so he f***** up the Auxy intro instead by making the base off key, slowing it down and making all around worse and hoped no one would notcie</p>

            <p>Is the intro/demo piece on the store using only sounds from the free version?<br>
Seems like the sounds used are from the Original pack, rather than anything from the last 6–7 years.</p>
<p>I was quite disappointed (though not surprised*) that the piece is so primitive and toy-like, and frankly, cheesy.</p>
<p>Auxy has limitations, but that demo clip is really underselling Auxy’s actual capabilities. Most people checking out that demo clip probably think it’s just a toy, with more serious music makers probably scrolling past Auxy.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that the userbase skews heavily towards young/teenage users, who are likely getting into music production for the first time.</p>
<p>And it’s no wonder they’ve always seemed to struggle to make Auxy a standout, profitable app.</p>
<p>*(It really is staggering how many basic marketing things the Auxy team get wrong, Terrible, terrible management. They half-ar*e everything. Or they’re simply just catastrophically sh*t at their job. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/exploding_head.png?v=12" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji" alt=":exploding_head:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/person_facepalming.png?v=12" title=":person_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":person_facepalming:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> )</p>

            <p>LootyTV - Glow:<br>
<a href="https://www.shazam.com/amp/track/536587545/glow" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.shazam.com/amp/track/536587545/glow</a></p>
<p>Sounds a lot like the Auxy Intro, right? I uploaded a video with an extended version of the Auxy Intro I made, giving credit to Auxy for the original soundtrack. But I got a copyright claim from YouTube saying that I used the song Glow by LootyTV. People in the replies have been saying that Glow is a ripoff of Auxy Intro, so I think <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/auxy">@Auxy</a> should handle this.</p>
