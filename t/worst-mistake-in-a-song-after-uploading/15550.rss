            <p>Make sure you have some sort of EQ that can give you a visual spectrum read out. Take a few sample EQ readings of tracks similar to the style you’re trying to make, and then dump your Auxy mix in there and make sure you haven’t overloaded the bass or the highs or something I don’t think visually using EQ is a good way to mix a track, but it is good to catch something that may be wrong. If you have really good monitor speakers, you won’t get any surprises, but for people mixing on smaller set ups, this is the way to go.</p>
<p>Personally, I find working in a 100% digital environment often leaves me with way more energy in the 10 K to 20 K region than is usually needed; a soft hi shelf often helps.</p>

            <p>I haven’t really had any song-ruining mistakes after uploading since I listen to the song at least 4 or 5 times before posting. However, a lot of times I’ll listen to my own music in the car or on computer speakers or something after it’s released and I realize that the snare sounds too loud, or the bass is too quiet, or some other mixing issue is there on certain sound systems</p>
<p>This really triggers my ocd lol</p>
