    <description>I love synths and i would love to have one for my own but sadly they are really expensive. I wondered if anyone of you owns a synth if so which synth and if you send a video or a photo of it that would be awesome :)</description>

            <p>I am thinking about buying Arturia miniLab. Since it has many knobs and it comes with a software that has a few of the legendary synths digital version i was totally down for Minilab. The thing is, in the software you cant tweak the preset sounds and play around with the synths.</p>

            <p>You are pretty lucky to have that synthðŸ‘€.<br>
OB-6 is perfecf. And yeah sadly modular synths are too expensive</p>

            <p>Novation circuit does look pretty usefull. I will think about that too. Sampler + synth sounds amazing. I will search more about its synth engines capabilities.</p>

            <p>I have a Auturia Mini Lab and Auturia KeyLab 88. My Auturia KeyLab comes preset with sounds, itâ€™s pretty cool. If youâ€™d like a video of it you can dm me. I usually use my Auturia mini because itâ€™s portable</p>
<p><strong>Edit: itâ€™s spelled Arturia <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/woman_facepalming.png?v=9" title=":woman_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":woman_facepalming:"></strong></p>

            <p>I have a few, both digital and analog. I have an OB-6, a modern version of the infamous OB-X (featured in tracks such as Jump by Van Halen), as well as a wide range of modular synths (both digital and analog). My dad and I build most of our modulars from diagrams and parts.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention though - if youâ€™re looking for budget stuff, the OB-6 is not the way to go. As for modularsâ€¦ alsoâ€¦ not typically the cheapest once you get a few modules and racks. Which is pretty much necessary.</p>

            <p>I have an Arturia Microbrute. Itâ€™s a great monophonic synth for the price &amp; size. Iâ€™ve only used it for playing around and jamming but I know you can link up click tracks (somehow) so you could actually use it for recording.</p>

            <p>I will also second the Circuit, forgot about that! Awesome synth editor on a computer (Mac or Windows I believe) and you can load your own samples. People are turned off by not having a screen but from what I understand when you wrap your head around it you wonâ€™t even miss the screen. My EM1 didnâ€™t have a screen either and I could program a beat on there fierce.</p>

            <p>Well, I could give you synth buying tips, but it seems like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> already covered what I would have said. (Except for a Novation Circuit. That is a great 1st synth, as it comes with 2 synth engines, and a sampler.)</p>
<p>So, Iâ€™ll tell you about what youâ€™ll need to use your synth, and how to record it.<br>
(Youâ€™re on Logic, right?)<br>
One thing that youâ€™ll need is an audio interface. It converts analog audio (audio from your synth) to digital audio (audio in your DAW).</p>
<p>Also, some audio interfaces come with a MIDI interface built in. With a MIDI interface, you will be able to control your synthâ€™s parameters, and even play it through Logic (or any DAW).</p>

            <p>There are inexpensive options. The Volca line is great (KORG) <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/</a>. Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering arenâ€™t too expensive <a href="https://teenageengineering.com/products/po" rel="nofollow noopener">https://teenageengineering.com/products/po</a>.</p>
<p>You can also go the route of apps + bluetooth midi controller or hardwired. This is quite a lot less expensive in some cases, and would let you use your hardware across multiple apps on iOS or on a desktop/laptop. I have the Nanokey Studio, highly recommend especially when paired with Gadget. It also comes with a small shedload of free software <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/nanokey_studio/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.korg.com/us/products/computergear/nanokey_studio/</a></p>
<p>Before I sold all of my stuff, I had a Yamaha RM1x (was pretty neat but a pain in the ass to program), Korg Electribe EA1 and EM1 (really wish I had these still) and an Alesis Micron.</p>
<p>Point being, you donâ€™t need to spend a ton of money to get into hardware or hardware feel. Thereâ€™s something to be said for tactile, hands on control.</p>
