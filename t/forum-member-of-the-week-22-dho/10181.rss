&lt;big&gt; **Featured Auxy Artist #22: @DHO** &lt;/big&gt; 

 &lt;big&gt;DHO&lt;/big&gt; is an American guy who plays &quot;Guitar, Bass and Tenor Ukulele, Mandolin, Banjo, Piano, Mallets, Melodica, Kalimba and Accordion.&quot;  His toolset includes Auxy, GarageBand, FL Studio &amp; Ableton Live 9 (Lite).

DHO has run the 2nd and 3rd Auxy Tournaments, for which he earned an Auxy forum unicorn. It takes a lot of time to run a tournament and a bunch of people enjoy it, so it&#39;s a cool contribution to the Auxy community. As a forum frequenter, DH0 was also active in the rapping topic, engaging in rap-battles. 

Let&#39;s show DHO some support ----&gt;  https://soundcloud.com/dhomusic/tracks.

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dho">@DHO</a> I normally don’t like trap (at all), but the spin you put on that genre is something I really enjoy. The Breakdancing in London song was top quality and the instrumental bits were great. I also love the atmospheric kinds of songs you do as well. Lastly, thank you for being such a supportive guy!</p>

            <p>Thanks, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a>. Both for the feedback and the rap battles. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>Pitch thing is noted. I think it’s a habit actually. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"> I have a lot of those when it comes to music. It started with risers but then I made everything a riser. Should probably stop that to prevent it from getting old. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>Glad you like my “quirky leads”. And yeah, I love me some fills. Also very happy to see you like DJ Witch in the House. What ever happened to the House Challenge Playlist though? Did I just miss it?</p>
<p>Nice to know I got that platform vibe down. I’m hoping to score some games soon. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

            <p>Hey DHO,</p>
<p>Firstly, thanks for running the Auxy Tournaments, with Andrew. Very cool.</p>
<p>Secondly, some feedback on your music.</p>
<p>Key characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pad progressions often play a key role.</li>
<li>Drums are solid, as per drum transitions used in ‘Fill me in’.</li>
<li>Good use of samples &amp; single drum-hits in drops / moments of silence, without overdoing it.<br>
"Yes”    “yeah”     “Yo!”      “hey!”  LOL    <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
<li>Quirky leads.</li>
</ol>
<p>My Fav recent DHO tracks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DJ Witch in the House - totally nailed the obscure house genre.</li>
<li>Space Caves - has a strong atmosphere (ironic given the space setting).</li>
<li>It’s over 200 - (liked this, apart from the two wee sections with loud hats).</li>
<li>Mission Accomplished - Neat intro and second section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strange Winds packs a couple of surprises in the middle! And I Got No Money has a platform game vibe at the start.</p>
<p>My only constructive feedback is that you’ve used pitch changes on a lot of tracks. It totally works in Space Caves, adding to the atmospheric mood, but maybe use it sparingly as it appears quite often.</p>
<p>You’re quite prolific with your track releases. Keep on making that music! And hosting the tournaments!</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of when I should have used hi hats? I went through and most of my tracks did.</p>

Thanks! Funnily enough, my normal style is jazz or ambient and the trap stuff is just what I post on SoundCloud.

Thanks again for picking me this week! I know it’s random but seems like such a coincidence as this week corresponded with a few events for me. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to everybody who has provided feedback! Your comments all made me smile. I love how long your feedback was. Inspires me to write longer feedback for Forum Members of the Week from now on. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/innocent.png?v=5" title=":innocent:" class="emoji" alt=":innocent:"></p>
<p>I hope you guys had a great week and continue to have great weeks all through the year. And next year.

I listened to quite a few of your tracks just now. You have an interesting style man, you remind me a bit of NotMiles sometimes, which is a compliment lol. Especially with those trippy chords. I really like the harder stuff you put out, and therefore Yeah, Yes, The Attack and Fill Me In are my favorites. The sound design in those tracks is really good, I’m a big fan of the sub-basses and the bass leads you used. Unfortunately I didn’t really have time to really give you constructive feedback, but I can still do so the next coming days if you wish.<br>
Keep it up man!</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dho">@DHO</a>! I’ve listened to a BUNCH of your stuff today to give feedback. Forgive the short post here (I posted quite a few comments on your tracks). I’m actually a big fan of the style of your first(?) track Summer Solstice. The style is sweet, and it has a nice vibe to it. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_mooo">@Mr_Mooo</a> - you too. You guys did great on that one. One of my favorites though has to be Microwave Oven. Great style, awesome drum fills with some nice sampling atmosphere. Sound layering was well executed. Also really nice chords. I’d love to work on a track in that style sometime if you’re up for it. Please keep up the great work.</p>

            <p>Hi my green friend from no rain land <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/four_leaf_clover.png?v=5" title=":four_leaf_clover:" class="emoji" alt=":four_leaf_clover:"> I really enjoyed communicating with you in the “hometown” thread and other … meme related threads.</p>
<p>About your music, IMO, very cool sound choice, and love the dark-ish atmosphere overall. My favorite: Space caves, DHO.exe, I got no money, it’s over 200.</p>
<p>Just some feed back below, if you don’t mind.<br>
• try including some hi hat sounds (especially after buildup) Those may make your songs much doper and cooler.<br>
• build in your songs sound similar. It might be nice to challenge add some twists or change drums.</p>
<p>Stay awesome!!</p>

            <p>Yo, DHO!!<br>
Your track, “Strange Winds” left me razzle-dazzled!!<br>
I can’t say that I’ve ever heared a track quite unique as that, or an artist quite unique as you!!<br>
Keep up the great work!!</p>

<p>My bad, that wasn’t the best way to phrase it. On “Strange Winds” in particular, I like the way that your choice of samples add to the song’s atmosphere. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>honestly a very unique auxy artist. Very wavy leads with some very unique melody combinations.</p>
<p>It kind of gives an otherworldly vibe. like something in a sci-fi movie (like a kind of urban sci-fi city. basically something you would find in a club on Corascant) My favorite of yours would probably be Microwave Oven. Incredibly powerful. With great progression, and in a way kind of sounds like a traditional japanese melody (which if you know me, you’ll know im a sucker for that kind of thing) All in all a great listen through all productions! keep it up! ^-^</p>
