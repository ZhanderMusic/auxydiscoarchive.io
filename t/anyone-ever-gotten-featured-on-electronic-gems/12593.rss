            <p>Recently got onto heroboard, 176k subs<br>

<p>I was looking for a label to release this song on, and they accepted it.<br>
There‚Äôs no real tips or tricks other than submit to channels that use your genre. Heroboard is pretty genreless, really on the chiller side of the music spectrum. They‚Äôre also pretty good because they provide graphics, mastering, and distribution.</p>

            <p>Got on Fluidified (383,000 subs)</p>
<p>ft. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/crystldawnmusic">@crystldawnmusic</a></p>

<p>Edit: looks like you are looking for channels that accept submissions. Fluidified does but they never respond to any of mine (the one that got uploaded wasn‚Äôt submitted, they just uploaded it), so it might be a waste of time. I would recommend submitting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LUNCHBOXMUSIC" rel="nofollow noopener">LUNCH BOX</a>, they‚Äôre not very big but they‚Äôre better than a lot of music channels that I know of.</p>
