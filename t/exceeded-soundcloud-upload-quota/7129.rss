    <title>Exceeded Soundcloud upload quota</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/exceeded-soundcloud-upload-quota/7129</link>
    <description>So I found out something pretty important just now.

Desperate to upload my new track, I went onto the desktop version of Soundcloud. (there is a way you can do that on your phone or iPad, I pretty much found out how through a wikihow article lol. I can link it if ya guys want)

I tried to upload it there, but it wouldn’t let me. Then I looked at the bottom and it said I have exceeded my three hour limit. So you’re only supposed to upload three hours of songs if you don’t have pro. I’d uploaded so many private tracks that Auxy wasn’t letting me upload any more to Soundcloud.

I deleted some of my yucky old embarrassing private tracks, and lo and behold, I was able to upload it.

I think I just solved a mystery, lol

If some of you do have pro but Auxy isn’t letting you upload, maybe it’s connection problems but now I know why it wasn’t letting me in particular upload.

Or maybe this was already a known problem. :thinking:</description>
