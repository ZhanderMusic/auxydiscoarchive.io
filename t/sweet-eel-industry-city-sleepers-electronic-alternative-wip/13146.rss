    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/sweet-eel-industry-city-sleepers-electronic-alternative-wip/13146</link>
    <description>Little something I&#39;ve been kicking around for a few days. Re-upped the sub so I&#39;m back - sometimes it&#39;s nice having nearly limitless possibilities with production, but, it&#39;s also suffocating sometimes :slight_smile:

Thx Auxy for the crazy placeholder names. I&#39;ve still got mixing work to do, need to sort out a &#39;B&#39; part and would like to try to remove some samples in favor of programming (possibly the drum loop and bass, I think both are do-able).

Danke! I&#39;ve never posted a WIP before, looking to kind of open up the process a bit.</description>

            <p>Awesome thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> yeah that’s the B section (to B, or not to B?) Well, back to A? I’ve noticed a lot of what I write is ABABAB lol…</p>
<p>Gonna def check into the beginning and I know EXACTLY what you’re talking about with the vocal, would be very easy to fix with audio tracks but I have a plan with some wonk volume automation.</p>
<p>Hopefully will get back to work on this on Monday.</p>

            <p>Sounds great IC.   Love the way it builds without rushing until it reaches that lovely vocal.</p>
<p>Three ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put something at the very start so it doesn’t start mid-flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could remove the last second of that vocal, at 1:31, when it restarts, then stops. Or else maybe repeat that brief vocal restart around 1:35.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end tail section goes darker at 1:40, which feels a bit anti-climatic after all that build-up of layers and then a drop. I assume that’s the B part that you’re still working on. Maybe consider making it sound lighter, so it’s not a downer. The rest of the track feels like there’s “hope” and it would be good to keep that feeling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the track has an authentic quality, that I like.</p>

            <p>Thanks man! It’s got a ways to go been only cooking about three days. Might try vocals, dunno. Definitely want to try to shed as many non-built in samples as possible.</p>
