    <title>Finally (with vocals!) - By Simon M Harris</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/finally-with-vocals-by-simon-m-harris/11289</link>
    <description>So hey guys, I don’t really release very much, but wanted to share this track with you since it is 100% made with Auxy apart from addig the vocals afterwards.
In this track I tried to go for a ”hit” more than I usually do, so it is very simple and straight forward.

I hope you like it!

            <p>Haha, yeah I would love to. So hard to find those things though…<br>
It would be so awesome to be featured on a Spotify playlist. But many of them you pay for I guess, the really big ones atleast. Or do you know something I don’t?? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> If so please do tell!</p>

            <p>Great audio engineering, levels all work really well to not drown out your great vocals, I started following your Spotify, look forward to listening to your other tracks</p>
<p>Edit: really like your track red dress, more my style I like to listen to then your finally track. Good stuff man</p>

            <p>Hey, thank you Sunny. Im really grateful for your comments.<br>
And I like your advice, I think it is a good idea to spread out a little. I guess it is out of my comfort zone, but I really should. The thing is I have wanted this for so long, to be able to just right about SOMETHING, like something stupid. But, haha, I always end up writing to muddled or coming back to the topic of love again. I guess I need to work on that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/muscle.png?v=5" title=":muscle:" class="emoji" alt=":muscle:"></p>
<p>As you said, those tracks you mentioned are 8 years old, but that is ok. The criticism still stands, even though I might have left that way of working a little bit.<br>
I like(d) the effect of auto-tune in some cases, to push it to high and get a more “digital” sound as it were. But I rarely do that nowadays, or maybe when I do I hope I have mastered it better, to not push it too hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, almost - Swedish!</p>
<p>Thanks alot for listening my friend!</p>
