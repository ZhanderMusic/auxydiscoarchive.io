    <title>Which tracks should Auxy repost? (Don&#39;t recommend your own releases/collabs!)</title>

    <description>OK, starting a thread to push recommendations for Auxy SC reposts to @Auxy and @Fredrik…

Note: You&#39;re not allowed to recommend your own stuff/collabs (and avoid asking people to recommend your stuff).

&amp;nbsp;
So… let&#39;s hear it…

            <p>I’ve personally set getting reposted by Auxy a goal for me but I’m not here to advertise myself. I’m here to advertise 5hyguy42. They’ve been making music a while and deserve to be reposted. That just me tho (being reposted would be nice but 5hyguy42 deserves it more)</p>

            <p>As someone who previously worked at SC, you’re possibly as well placed as anyone here to speak on the supposed value of the SC repost feature.</p>
<p>I tend to repost only those tracks which I think might appeal to people who enjoy what I’m putting out.</p>
<p>There’s an unspoken mutuality about reposting, where reposting others might be reciprocated behaviour that can expand audience reach beyond your existing followers.</p>
<p>The difference with SC is that there’s no clear line between pure listeners and uploaders/producers. Listeners have better places to go, so SC likely skews disproportionately towards producers compared to other music platforms. So, any use of repost is likely being impacted by that skew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Auxy crowd… I suspect the Auxy user base skews extremely towards hobbyists, rather than aspiring pros, so aren’t optimising their SC profiles for audience building. Being quite young on average, perhaps the social aspects are also influencing repost popularity (i.e. a generation who grew up with online social media).</p>
<p>Tbf, Auxy itself might be part of a feedback loop in that hobbyist skew — though it’s likely also a symptom of the mobile music production space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d be curious to know what % of Auxy people who post on SC also publish on Spotify, etc… as, I suspect, that’s generally another signifier that they’re taking their music a bit more seriously.</p>

            <p>I tend to repost auxy tracks that I really enjoy for like a week on my profile to try and promote the track within the auxy community, although I barely increase plays. I try not to clutter up my soundcloud profile and the ‘stream’ page too much.</p>

            <p>Can you explain why most people who upload tracks to SoundCloud, also frequently repost tracks from other artists? Makes it really hard to keep track of what people upload just by following, since the tracks you make yourselves are drowning in the stream of other tracks. I think it makes sense to repost stuff if you want to be a curator of things, but I don’t see why it makes sense for people trying to build their own profiles on SoudCloud.</p>
