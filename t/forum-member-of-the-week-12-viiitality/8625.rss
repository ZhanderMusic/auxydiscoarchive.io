&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #12: @viiitality   &lt;/big&gt;

The first three names randomly selected for this week were returned to the pool, as we want to focus on people who have been supporting the featured forum members. On the fourth spin of the wheel, we got a winner... 

&lt;big&gt;Viiitality&lt;/big&gt; is a Texas-based Pilipino student and musician.  According to an earlier post he was one of the top-20 breaststrokers for his age group in the US last year (and top in his state). He plays the tuba &amp; ukulele and is learning guitar and piano. He enjoys Deadmau5&#39;s music. Meanwhile his own music has been reposted by Auxy and shortlisted for Beat The Clock. He&#39;s a regular on the forum and every time I see his name, I think of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTMeAroCyHw).   Show him some :loveit: 

**Week starting: 19 Mar, 2018.** 
- Please listen to at least one of their tracks (or more) 
- Provide at least one Soundcloud comment / feedback about their music during their week. 
- Comment in this thread once you&#39;ve provided any feedback. 
- If you want people to comment on your week, remember to comment for others!

            <p>Enjoyed listening to your tracks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/viiitality">@viiitality</a>!</p>
<p>Your collab with Intrepid was on point. Great vibes and percussion… definitely one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Love Ambivalent! I think my only suggestion would be using a different instrument to be layered the lead at around 1:37, I feel the tonsil doesn’t fit the vibe. I like the way it sounds at 2:17 though.</p>
<p>That buildup in Eye Of the Storm though! Awesome snare. Great melodies, but the Lobster (I think) is a little random towards the end.</p>
<p>Cruise is really cool! I think there could be some transitions though, even some sweeper would help.</p>
<p>Black and White &amp; Night Sky are top notch! I love the wubby EDM vibes.</p>
<p>Sorry I was a little late this week! I’ll try and listen to more of your songs soon. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Just one last comment before the topic closes - I love your tracks, and it’s amazing how much of an improvement I’ve seen in your tracks over time! I’m not saying your old tracks are bad, because they’re great - but your new tracks just keep getting better! Hope you hit 100 followers soon, and hope you had a great week!</p>

            <p>Hey Viii,</p>
<p>After listening to several of your tracks,  my two favourites are Black and White &amp; Molecular Activity.</p>
<p>You use a range of Auxy techniques. Black and White showcases your Auxy skills well with quick-cuts between a bunch of Auxy tricks, as does Freeze at a slower tempo. Virgo and Nightsky use a stammering effect which you seem to enjoy playing with. Aquarius has the bounce going on &amp; Any Means dishes out various styles of Wub-Wuuuub-Wuuuuuuuub.   I like the piano runs in Molecular Activity too.  Lots of Auxy skills demonstrated.</p>
<p>I only listened to your solo tracks, as it’s hard to know your role in collabs. My one suggestion would be to release some more recent solos yourself so that you don’t get too lost in all of the collaborations.  Share some more Vii.</p>

<p>Can I just say <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/viiitality">@viiitality</a>, I love your music! I think the thing that stands out to me is your drum choice against these soft leads. Clicks and snares and the occasional Ahhhs. I especially like that some of the tracks (that I could tell) follow the kick for ducker, letting those interesting drum choices stand out. Just interesting, and thoughtful percussion. Just keeps it cool.</p>

<p>thanks Sunny! although I don’t play percussion, I like to think I’m improving on my beats overall. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/upside_down_face.png?v=5" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>

<p>My faves:</p>
<p>Ambivalent: Proof that a chill track can be B I G. Just lovely all round.</p>
<p>Eye Of The Storm (Voltt X Viii) is an amazing collaboration. The amount of swag just blows me away. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/voltt">@Voltt</a> if you guys make anything together again you would be a force of nature!</p>
<p>Night Sky delicate and beautiful sounds. Kinda reminds me of Owl City’s Fireflys in parts.</p>
<p>Any Means: I just like it! Uplifting. Enjoy the flute-like sounds, and the wubs.</p>
<p>Virgo: Maybe it comes across as simple, but this is what I mean by your gentle lead choices against your cool drums.</p>
<p>Crazy amount of work in 9 months.</p>

<p>Lucid sounds so professional! Even the drums at the beginning are out of my league! I love all the aspects of the song. It keeps me interested because the instruments are always changing and it is very fast pitched. The build is amazing, and OMG that drop! H e a v y. I don’t have any experience in that kind of drop but I have gotta say I like it. I like the breaks. Very creative. This song is so interesting! The second drop is yet again awesome. And it is so much different to drop one as well! I’m bad at that kind of stuff. There are certain aspects of this song that just make it sound so professional, like the rythym of the breaks in the drop, or the drums panning out. AMAZING!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yeah! I kinda took over most of the drum patterns in this song, so I’m proud of my percussion. originally, I was going to go for a more melodic drop, but <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/intrepidmusic">@IntrepidMusic</a> twisted it beautifully into a bassy drop. glad you loved it!</p>

<p>Ambivalent is really calming. And THOSE FILLS AT THE BEGINNING!!! I love them! I love the toms before the drop. The drop is awesome! It kinda reminds me of a song. Don’t know what though. Amazing! I love the use of tonsil after the drop. Not too overpowering in my opinion. I love the piano. And I never noticed the amazing chords before I heard this piano! They spark emotion, beautiful. I love the use of tiny, and again amazing fills. In the second drop I can’t really hear the clap that much because of the hour, but I think that that’s not that bad because I like the way the second drop is powerful. The ending actually brought tears to my eyes. That song was beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>this song, IMO, was created with the most passion and emotion from me. those spicy chords that Phoenix thankfully lended over to me were so good, and some tweaks here and there helped Amivalent really shine!</p>

<p>Oh yes, eye of the storm! I’ve heard this song before. And it is still the show stopper I remember it as. I love all the different aspects. The drop is awesome! I love the bounce. I love the pitch in the second half as well, and the ahhhs. The chords are amazing btw. I love the snaps and the exciting toms after the first drop. I love the drums in the build. Did I hear a hahahaha evil laugh in the second drop? If so, do you know where you got it from? That second drop is 12/10 AMAZING!!! I love it! All the aspects work together, the aaahs, te lobster, the chords, the drums. Love it. The transition out is very smooth, and the pan out is awesome.</p>

</aside>
<p>hey, wanna learn a secret? I didn’t use Lobster, I used Breath. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> anyways, this song is basically chords and two melodies (one by me, and one by <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a>) that join into one in the end. Voltt’s a really fun guy to collab with!</p>

<p>Your remix of midnight ramen is so cool! I remember that competition! Did you win? I’m pretty sure you won. If you didn’t, then first must’ve been repost worthy! Because your remix is AWESOMELY AMAZING. It’s just so awesome. I love all aspects of it, the breaks, the new instruments, epic! Your songs all sound so professional! The wub pattern seems familiar, but those wubs are 10/10! I love the pitch. This song is so cool! Te piano at the end is beautiful. Sparks emotion again for me.</p>

<p>I made this on an airplane to Manila, and the first thing that came up to my mind was NCT 127’s song, Fire Truck. the basses are kinda similar, but Fire Truck was the inspiration for this cool drop. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

<p>Ok, one more is all I have time for. Cruise is awesome. The melody goes so well with the chords, and I love the use of layering piano. The kiss(?) is awesome. This song makes me feel so relaxed! The drums are awesome. The second drop is amazing. I love all the aspects, and of course the breaks. Amazing!</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn’t give that much feedback this week. I hope you find what I said useful. My favourite of your tracks was either visions or eye of the storm. You are an amazing creator!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>thanks! Cruise was originally a collab with, again, the great <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a>, that was highkey abandoned. I picked it up again after a month or so and gained inspiration to finish the chill track!</p>
<p>thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_mooo">@Mr_Mooo</a> for taking your time to review my stuff! I highly appreciate it and will be listening to your discography soon! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Can I just say <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/viiitality">@viiitality</a>, I love your music! I think the thing that stands out to me is your drum choice against these soft leads. Clicks and snares and the occasional Ahhhs. I especially like that some of the tracks (that I could tell) follow the kick for ducker, letting those interesting drum choices stand out. Just interesting, and thoughtful percussion. Just keeps it cool.</p>
<p>My faves:</p>
<p><strong>Ambivalent</strong>: Proof that a chill track can be B I G. Just lovely all round.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Of The Storm (Voltt X Viii)</strong> is an amazing collaboration. The amount of swag just blows me away. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a> if you guys make anything together again you would be a force of nature!</p>
<p><strong>Night Sky</strong> delicate and beautiful sounds. Kinda reminds me of Owl City’s Fireflys in parts.</p>
<p><strong>Any Means</strong>: I just like it! Uplifting. Enjoy the flute-like sounds, and the wubs.</p>
<p><strong>Virgo</strong>: Maybe it comes across as simple, but this is what I mean by your gentle lead choices against your cool drums.</p>
<p>Crazy amount of work in 9 months.</p>

<p>Visions is awesome. Maybe my favourite so far. I think it’s because of the melodic percussion. I can never get that right. The jelly chords are cool. The hour is a bit strong, you can hear it when the other layers pan out. I love all the drums. A great song!</p>
<p>Ok, one more is all I have time for. Cruise is awesome. The melody goes so well with the chords, and I love the use of layering piano. The kiss(?) is awesome. This song makes me feel so relaxed! The drums are awesome. The second drop is amazing. I love all the aspects, and of course the breaks. Amazing!</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn’t give that much feedback this week. I hope you find what I said useful. My favourite of your tracks was either visions or eye of the storm. You are an amazing creator!</p>
