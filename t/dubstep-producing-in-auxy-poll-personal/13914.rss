            <p>To add on to what <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/foryou">@foryou</a> said, I think your dubstep tracks are pretty cool for being made in auxy but it‚Äôs really tough to get that more mainstream dubstep sound in this limited daw. It was obviously designed for EDM type music even though they‚Äôve been branching out recently with new sounds. When I think of dubstep, I think Different Heaven, Skrillex, Flux Pavillion etc. which would be pretty much impossible to make in auxy</p>

            <p>dubstep isn‚Äôt popular in auxy because it‚Äôs nearly impossible to make it‚Ä¶ future bass and chill are popular in this community because they sound pretty close to what future bass and chill sound like when they‚Äôre made in real DAWs like ableton or fl‚Ä¶ the majority of dubstep that comes from auxy sounds nowhere close to the quality that it does when it‚Äôs made in a real DAW. you and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cornea">@Cornea</a> are probably the only exceptions to that statement. i don‚Äôt see dubstep ever being popular in auxy because they would have to implement better sound design capabilities in order for people to make it. and usually the reason genres become popular in auxy is because many people start making them.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot man, to explain the poll, to be honest I feel as if Dubstep in the Auxy community is underrated, but I wanted the opinion of the community itself on that.</p>
<p>Sure, I‚Äôve had a few songs reposted by Auxy, but I feel as if Dubstep just doesn‚Äôt take the spot of most of the songs in the Auxy application feed.</p>
<p>Here, let me explain a bit more.</p>
<p>The songs in which get posted within the Auxy application feed are TOP knotch. I absolutely love them. Mr. Anderson‚Äôs the Heavens is a good example, Blackocean‚Äôs Crimson  is another good example, but when will a Dubstep track reach that spot?</p>
<p>In all honesty, creating Dubstep in Auxy consists of an INTENSE amount of creativity, definitely patience and well, some basic Dubstep knowledge, yet it seems as if it can never reach the spot of ‚ÄúFeatured Track.‚Äù</p>
<p>It always seems like it gets a ‚Äúhere here, I like this, but lets not give it too much support now.‚Äù</p>

<p>I agree with this, I definitely feel as if Dubstep in the Auxy community is quite underrated. I also agee on the fact it shouldn‚Äôt be utterly popular like future bass was in the community before.</p>
<p>And thank you for your opinion on my music, it meant a lot.</p>

            <p>I feel like I answered that a bit oddly.</p>
<p>I think dubstep is pretty underrated, but at the same time I don‚Äôt think it should be ridiculously ‚Äúpopular‚Äù with the community (don‚Äôt want another future bass era 2: lmaOTT).</p>
<p>It could use some more people doing impressive stuff with it since some people have been leaving (cornea for example) and those shoes should be at least somewhat filled.<br>
The creativity and sounds are there, I just don‚Äôt feel like a enough people utilize them enough to produce something that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel like it was made in Auxy‚Äù.</p>
<p>As for u, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/goxenar">@Goxenar</a>, ya doin fantastic. Auxy &amp; sound design wise, solid A. But there‚Äôs always some minor nitpicks I find about ur stuff sometimes.</p>
<p>Idk what I really mean myself with this post if it makes sense at all. I‚Äôm on mobile, in a somewhat noisy area so my mind is a bit in and out writing this and also having a lack of profread-ability</p>
