    <description>Hello, hello,
I have just published my new track: https://soundcloud.com/yaneeck/water
It took me a (long) while to finish the track, but I hope you&#39;ll like it. I do :slight_smile: 
Take care,

            <p>I am an impatient person so maybe you’re right about underdeveloped parts <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Anyway I am grateful for your opinion.<br>
It feels so well to read such positive words <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Can you give me more details on this Plaid thing?</p>

            <p>I like it.<br>
Feels a little underdeveloped in parts (imo), but still very much like it.</p>
<p>As always, love you’re progressions.</p>
<p>…and that counter-melody at 2:3 is pure Plaid. Gave me chills. Love it!</p>

            <p>You’re welcome my friend. It’s very good.  And yes, starting is the hardest part.  Keep me posted when you do start “Earth”…would love to hear the progress. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Thank you for your kind words <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I don’t think that “Earth” will come very soon since I’ve just made “Water” which took me a few weeks of trials and (mostly) errors <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/disappointed_relieved.png?v=5" title=":disappointed_relieved:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed_relieved:"><br>
Then again, I’m not a machine <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and maybe I’ll create a new song this week? It happened to me before to be suddenly very creative, so…who knows? Wish me luck <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sunglasses.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"><br>
After all the most important and the hardest thing is to begin, don’t you think?</p>

            <p>Great job Tomasz!! I love it! Thanks for sharing the early draft with me. The final version turned out really good my friend. When do we get “Earth”? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Awesome! Really like where you took it at 2:20ish giving off this great Royksopp vibe. As always your composition is incredibly thoughtful. Sounds great overall the mix is solid, well done my man <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/3.png?v=5" title=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t3:"></p>
