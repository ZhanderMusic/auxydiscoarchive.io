    <description>AKA Clavin - Sunlight In My Eyes

https://soundcloud.com/akaclavin/sunlight-in-my-eyes/s-hPtTi

&amp;nbsp;
Draft 1, so more to do with the main instrumentation and drums.
Will be finished with soulful male vocals.

Aiming for something that feels like a smooth techno remix of a vocal track. A simple structure, built on a chilled, uptempo groove.

Evoking hot, hazy, deamy summer days, with the scattered sunlight breaking through the trees or off the water, sparkling in your eyes.

…filtered through a slightly chilled clubbing energy, dancing on the beach in a sexy pair of shades.

&amp;nbsp;
Let me know if I&#39;m close to hitting it.

And, as always, all feedback welcome. :+1:</description>

            <p>Thanks, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blakkaz">@blakkaz</a><br>
Was hoping you’d take a look, seeing as Techno’s one of your things.</p>
<p>I started playing with a simple, two note bassline, padded it out with some simulated harmonics, which then led to the ‘ooh’ harmonies.<br>
From that point, I wanted something synthetic for a bit of contrast, so added the skipping plucky synth notes. The vibe about where I wanted to take it sprung from that simple juxtaposition.</p>
<p>I wanted to go with the Techno influence as I thought the contrast was more interesting than simply making it a regular Ibiza-style Trance or Deep House track. I wanted something that felt like an authentic Techno remix of an Electronica/Electro-Pop crossover song.</p>
<p>I’ve reworked and rearranged it a bit since, mostly to bring the duration down, but I’m not sure if I’ve sacrificed the spirit of what I was trying to achieve – something that’s part song, part standalone (Summer) techno piece – with the non-vocal parts being sustained enough to for listeners to enjoy it as they would a Summer club instrumental – dare I say ‘anthem’.</p>
<p>Thinking I possibly need to juice up the Techno aspect a touch more – maybe through the drums.<br>
Just needs a little more edge, more ‘bite’.</p>
<p>I’ll through up a link to a new revision in the next day or so. Would be good to get a second round of feedback, to know if I’m improving it – or going backwards.</p>

            <p>I absolutely loved the instrumentation choices you’ve made in this one.</p>
<p>It felt like the perfect mix of contemporary melodic techno (Kompakt/Ostgut Ton/Afterlife) with a touch of nostalgia (Vangelis). I’m curious as to the inspiration that lead you to make techno?</p>
<p>I feel like it might benefit from either an expansion of the current, or perhaps a secondary lead/melody introduced in the back half of the track…?</p>
<p><small>Also, as a personal preference, I’d love to hear this in the 125-130 bpm range.</small></p>

            <blockquote>
<p>maybe an electric piano riff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hah. I actually have one in the project, but I removed it from this arrangement.<br>
It didn’t feel right. Even just the sounds made it feel a little too jazzy, softening any harder edge the track might still have – which I wanted to retain.</p>
<p>There’s a small chance it might reappear in the breakdown during the 3rd verse (3:33 – 4:01), but only a small chance as I’m more likely to use vocal layers under the main verse vocals.</p>

Re: Drums</p>
<p>I want them to feel a little like they’re on rails. An engaging, but mostly unobtrusive rhythm groove that just keeps going and gives everything a bit of a shuffle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Re: Stuttering impact</p>
<p>I’ll have a think about pulling that stuttering impact back a little, though I don’t want to smooth everything over.<br>
I want to maintain a Techno element, rather than shift it to Deep House.</p>
<p>I’m inclined to think that it needs punctuation like that to stop it being a monotony of smooth vibes, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>Same with the 1:54 addition, though that could possibly also be pulled back a little, or blended in a little more smoothly.</p>
<p>Issue is, if everything moves too smoothly between sections, then you don’t get that sudden injection of fresh energy and it starts to feel a little too much like one groove.</p>
<p>Also, worth keeping in mind that there will be vocals, so that 1:54 addition comes in as part of the shift from verse to pre-chorus. (That particular move from verse to pre-chorus appears twice in the piece.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Conversely, I think the 2:15 – 3:19 section needs to step up a bit more. The chorus (2:22 – 2:50) is meant as a an incomplete step up in energy, because the real peak is that 2:15 – 3:19 section (also appears 4:30 – 4:58).</p>
<p>Maybe needs some rezzy chords underneath to make it a blissed-out section, in so far as this track has one.</p>

            <p>when the drums come in around 1min in, would reccomend adding some more variation in the percussion to make it sound more natural.</p>
<p>the thing, idk what to call it, countermelody? harmony? the stuttery thing that comes in at 1:29-ish, that sound you chose for it doesn’t feel quite right for this song. A bit too harsh or aggressive imo for something that seems more laid back.</p>
<p>especially that melody or whatever that comes in at 1:50 and re-appears in a few other places, do not make that appear so suddenly and with such sharp of a sound. It’s fine if it appears suddenly if it’s a gentle sound, and it’s fine if it fades in if it’s an aggressive sound(so the listener can get used to it)</p>
<p>otherwise sounds gr8</p>

            <p>I’m thinking (hoping) that the length will feel mitigated by the vocal.<br>
There are a couple of stretches where vocals will be, which might currently feel too long without that extra element in there.</p>
<p>If I was set on getting the duration down, I’d have to rethink most sections.<br>
I’ll aim for the current length and structure, but consider a radio edit if it still feels long.</p>
<p>The challenge is that I want it to feel like a proper vocal track (verses, rather than 2 lines repeated throughout the track), but also feel like a Summer club track at the same time, so it needs to have sustained instrumental segments.</p>
<p>I’ll probably do some benchmarking for structure.</p>
<p>I have something fairly specific in mind for vocal delivery/style – lazy, sparse and soulful.<br>
I’ll find a reference vocal as guidance for the vocalist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is a little harsh but it’s a good juxtaposition against how smooth everything else is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you say, it benefits by having something to change the energy slightly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the intro melody is awesome (is that from the new pads?</p>

<p>More than half the sounds are from the new pack. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Lead at 2:28 awesome, love the tonality it is a little harsh but it’s a good juxtaposition against how smooth everything else is. When the shuffling percussion and drums come in I was like yeahhh this is nice, the intro melody is awesome (is that from the new pads? I didn’t try them out at all yet).</p>
<p>At first I thought it might be a bit long but you varied the sections up enough that it kept me going, sometimes my attention span is very short. I can definitely see some editing down once you get the vocals going but it’s not going to take anything away from it, it’ll just be done in a way that have the vocals pop and mix nicely with everything else you laid down here.</p>
<p>All I gotta say is - can’t wait to hear it with vox on top <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Everything you just described your song to be I totally heard throughout it. I especially love the melody in the intro just by itself, so simple yet interesting. Good job!</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
Draft 1, so more to do with the main instrumentation and drums.<br>
Will be finished with soulful male vocals.</p>
<p>Aiming for something that feels like a smooth techno remix of a vocal track. A simple structure, built on a chilled, uptempo groove.</p>
<p>Evoking hot, hazy, deamy summer days, with the scattered sunlight breaking through the trees or off the water, sparkling in your eyes.</p>
<p>…filtered through a slightly chilled clubbing energy, dancing on the beach in a sexy pair of shades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Let me know if I’m close to hitting it.</p>
<p>And, as always, all feedback welcome. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
