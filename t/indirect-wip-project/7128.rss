    <title>INDIRECT (WIP) (Project)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indirect-wip-project/7128</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!
I have been working on this track recently and I love the way this is going, but Iâ€™m a tad bit stuck on what to do. Any help, comments, feedback, criticism would be very helpful.

Thanks ðŸ˜€

            <p>Itâ€™s sounding good! I added a couple elements that I thought might work. Just a new melody at the end and some lower chords to act as a bridge, or a lead into a bridge. I work slowly, so I thought I should share what I have now, even though it doesnâ€™t add much. Hopefully gives you some ideas.</p>

<p>Love his trackâ€™s vibes. I think you should try making it EDM.</p>

            <p>I donâ€™t have Auxy, atm (iPhone stopped working), but I use Ableton Live.</p>
<p>Could you export a little bit of the audio so I can hear?</p>
