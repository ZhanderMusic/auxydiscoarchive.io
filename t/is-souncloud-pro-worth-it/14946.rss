            <p>I’ve run out of minutes. it’s annoying as heck, so I guess pro would be good right about now. (I don’t have it. but if you wanna keep uploading then you gotta get it eventually)</p>

            <p>I had it for awhile. If you want to be able to replace audio files and not lose comments, it’s a must. You get more upload time, but for the cost, I’d rather showcase my best / newest work there and funnel people toward something like BandCamp or etc. Other than musicians I legit don’t know “normal” people who use it…</p>

            <p>It depends on three things:</p>
<p>1.) Whether you want to go further or not with posting on SoundCloud and making your name more widespread</p>
<p>2.) How much of an audience you have right now that is consistently coming back to see your content</p>
<p>3.) how you are planning to advertise and promote your content</p>
<p>That’s it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>EDIT: i haven’t read any of the other replies so sorry if i repeated something</p>

            <p>I’m with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/nightowl">@NightOwl</a> on this one. Unless you feel like you’re really going somewhere with music, have a good following, and is putting in the work to branch out &amp; expand your brand, I wouldn’t suggest it.<br>
I don’t have it because I don’t feel like I’ve fulfilled any of those things mentioned, and I’m still doing fine. I don’t have enough “good” tracks to really warrant the extra time either.</p>

            <p>Depends on ur dedication with music? If u plan to have an ongoing career with it and plan to put out a lot of tracks then it’s definitly worth it. Wish I had it many years ago where I wouldn’t have to delete tracks to free up play minutes</p>

            <p>I use the free plan.  I honestly think that pro is only worth it if you’re already an artist with a decent following to where you can bring in a profit.  Otherwise there’s already so much you can do with free so why pay if you aren’t at a point that it’s worth it.</p>
