    <title>Dadmother - Mr. Anderson’s “The Heavens”, But Everything Is Terrible And You’re Actually In Hell [high-brow artistry/enlightenment/self-actualization)</title>

    <description>I’d like to thank @MR_ANDERSON for existing, and for giving the Auxy a beautiful creation that I have been blessed to be able to enhance, to amplify, and to ultimately strengthen into something truly mesmerizing.

Now is the time.

Close your eyes.

Take a deep breath.
