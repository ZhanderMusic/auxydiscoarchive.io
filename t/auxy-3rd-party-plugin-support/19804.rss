            <p>It would be great but can’t imagine it would happen for a myriad of reasons. There’s lots of other awesome hosts out there though (some of my favorites include Nanostudio and Aum).</p>
<p>Would rather see Auxy devs produce their own AUv3 in some capacity than have it become an AU host, just can’t imagine what a nightmare the UI would be and without any kind of proper midi routing I really don’t know how things like automation would map to CCs for different plugins…</p>
