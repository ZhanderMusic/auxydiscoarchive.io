    <title>Looking for artwork creators?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/looking-for-artwork-creators/3140</link>
    <description>Hey! I need some artwork for my new upcoming track! I cant make it myself because i dont have a computer with photoshop and all those programs and applications. Maybe some of you know how to make artwork and maybe want to make mine. If you happen to want to make my artwork i’ll send you the track and tell you what i would like. Thanks!</description>

            <p>In the interest of keeping things tidy I figured I’d cannibalize this request and maybe we could leave it open / long standing. I’d assume there’s always going to be people looking for artwork assistance so this could be a springboard for those discussions.</p>
<p>Instead of there being a boatload of threads on the same subject.</p>
