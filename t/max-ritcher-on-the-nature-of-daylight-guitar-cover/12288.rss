            <p>I think the guitar works well enough at the start, while the melody is still quite sparse.<br>
More nuance in the ‘performance’ would add depth. So, rather than deleting the early guitars entirely, consider ways to make them feel more natural.</p>
<p>Explore using soft notes and subtle Volume, Shape and Tone to mimic more human variance in the performance.</p>

            <p>Hiya.<br>
That’s a big undertaking. That track is such a subtle masterpiece.</p>
<p>I think your got a reasonable foundation, but it feels like it needs to build sooner. Subtle layers. Something to add texture and evolve the interest.</p>
<p>Up until Scene 6 (iirc), the notes are sparse enough to feel passably natural. As more complex guitar melodies are introduced, the quantisation becomes increasingly apparent - and we’re reminded that this is sequenced midi.</p>
<p>It’s a tough one to crack, to work around that midi quantisation. I think you have the skeleton there, though you need to figure out a proper way to end the piece.</p>
