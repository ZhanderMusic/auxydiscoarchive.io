    <title>Sketch 25 (WIP, Genre?)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/sketch-25-wip-genre/4251</link>
    <description>Yet another semi-developed idea to add to my list of things I need to finish...

This time it’s an upbeat stepper... (maybe one day I’ll settle on a single genre. Maybe, it’s time to start splitting it off into separate identities.)

Enjoy. Thoughts and feedback always welcome. :)
Not sure what genre to tag it, so thoughts on that also welcome.</description>

            <p>Nah. I really feel you were closer with chillstep. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Sketch 25 has a closer relation to dubstep variants, than synthwave variants.<br>
That’s even clearer to me now, since your first mentioned it and I’ve checked out some stuff in that family.</p>
<p>As nice as it is (I’m familiar with timecop1983), if I was to aim for Dreamwave, it would feel inauthentic,  arbitrarily redefining the track — and moving away from whatever themes inspired it in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks though. You have helped. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I hadn’t heard of that one.<br>
I checked out some <a href="https://youtu.be/Hk-AQ4O5KiI?t=55s" rel="nofollow noopener">examples</a> and I can hear why you’d say that.</p>
<p>I think you’ve given me a possible direction to explore and develop.<br>
Might strip it down and rebuild it. I’m now thinking something in between plaintive chillstep and a louder, more overt dubstep track.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Thanks. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=6" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Chillstep, as a dubstep spin-off, feels much closer than dreamwave, which is presumably an off-shoot of synthwave, which still feels like an odd fit, to me.)</p>

            <p>Meh, no big deal, I was typing on my phone so being very conservative with my explanation (still am, in fact). I didn’t mean the track sounds like a finished synthwave track, more that the lead synth sounded a bit synthwave to me, and so could be developed in that direction (if you chose to). <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fantom87">@Fantom87</a> may in fact be onto something with dreamwave though.</p>

            <p>I think it’s more dreamwave if anything. Has too new of a feel to just be Synthwave so definitely dreamwave, or chillstep.</p>

            <p>I’d still be interested to hear more thoughts on what genre this most closely falls under…</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/sketch25" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/sketch25</a></p>
<p>It’s like 2-step meets dubstep, but somewhere between the Burial era and the harder wobble and wub era.<br>
Otherwise, I’ll fall back to the generic <em><span class="hashtag">#electronic</span></em> or even the dreaded (by me) <em><span class="hashtag">#edm</span></em>.</p>
<p>I dunno.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I’ve got so many ‘start of something’ bits in the Auxy project backlog, that haven’t even made it to ‘Sketch’ phase.<br>
(I’ve even started offloading them to a separate folder on iCloud Drive, and temporarily removing them from Auxy, to make my Auxy project list easier to digest. Hopefully, I’ll come back to them at some point.)</p>
<p>I just need to knuckle down and work through them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>very well put together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure I’d agree that they’re well put together, though I’m prouder of some than others.<br>
I think my ‘electro-pop’ pieces are the closest to finished in terms of the instrumental composition (although both will end up as songs, so still need lyrics/vocals), though I still consider them demo quality at best.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/learning-to-breathe" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/learning-to-breathe</a><br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/you-dont-know" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/you-dont-know</a></p>
<p>Maybe this piece also…<br>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
Imo, one of my weaknesses is production detailing, the little flourishes that add character and texture to a piece, beyond the vibe, general structure and hook.<br>
I’d like to spend more time working on that side of things, but I’ll often get struck by a new idea, so going deeper gets sacrificed in service of capturing the start of the next new idea.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure it fits neatly into a specific genre.<br>
What genres would you say are in there?</p>
<p>And, thanks for the offer of a collab.</p>
<p>I should say that I’m unlikely to want this to end up as an FB track.<br>
I’m not sure how well the main riff would work at a typical FB tempo.</p>
<p>[Edit. Actually, a slight tempo push to ~140 could make it interesting, as the main riff would still work at 140, then drop to half-time for the big synth moments. Hmmm.]</p>
<p>I could see it working as a big room track, even though it’s another genre I’m really not a fan of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Maybe I’ll share the project file and let people do their own take on it - or give a green like for people to cover/remake it.</p>

            <p>Yet another semi-developed idea to add to my list of things I need to finish…</p>
