    <title>Finishing My Music</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/finishing-my-music/5044</link>
    <description>Over the years, I&#39;ve written hundreds of jams in Auxy, Logic Pro X, Garageband for iOS, and a few other places.  I say &quot;written&quot; because, with a few exceptions, NOT A SINGLE ONE of them is finished.  And in order for me to make any progress in the musical world, that has got to end soon.  


Here&#39;s my theory on why this is the case:
I sit down, possibly with nothing in my head, perhaps with a fully formed track in there.  I start writing, recording, editing, etc, and soon I&#39;ve got the beginnings of a drop.  
Once I think I&#39;ve mostly finished the drop,  I start to write a lead in to my drop.  I flesh that out as I see fit.
Now, I&#39;m left with a 1:30 or so jam...
...and I don&#39;t know where to go.

Any advice?

I know there are tons of ways to structure tracks (e.g.: A-B-A type movements,  Chorus/Verse/Bridge type sections, etc.)
My problem is, once I&#39;ve climbed all the way up to that Chorus/Climax/Drop, I am at a loss as to where to go.  Should I introduce new musical material, or should I go with a more repitition-based approach?  I have a lot of trouble avoiding being &quot;too repetitive&quot;, and not introducing so much new material that it becomes a whole different song.

In addition, what are the elements of a song you don&#39;t repeat?  Transitions?  Buildups?  Melodies?  Basslines?

Oh my...I&#39;ve got so many questions...I hope they make sense and aren&#39;t too much to answer...
I know that &quot;practice makes perfect.&quot;  
The problem is, I don&#39;t know what to practice!

With regard to the wonderful Auxy community,

            <p>Dope questions. I think arrangement / structure is the major task that can help so much to get your track rolling.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd consider either a) a regular/stringent buildup from 0 to 100 if you‚Äôre working with a genre that allows that (like ambient, downtempo, piano stuff and epic things), or b) a rather classical arranged structure if more pop/tech oriented:</p>
<ul>
<li>intro</li>
<li>1st buildup/drop</li>
<li>1st chorus</li>
<li>post-chorus</li>
<li>‚Äòverse‚Äô if you wanna call it that way (maybe introducing a new melody/ addition</li>
<li>2nd buildup/drop</li>
<li>2nd chorus</li>
<li>outro</li>
</ul>
<p>That - at least- works its magic for me most of the times <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but also: really feel free to dm so many of us for feedback on specific songs (which we all should do more). &lt;3</p>

            <p>I would go with the more repetitive approach after the drop to keep it familiar, but make variations to avoid tiring repetition. You could also change it into a different track altogether, then later bring it back to the original idea.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thought that there is a right or wrong way of structuring, is what‚Äôs slowing down creative momentum. IMO, there are no wrong ways of doing things, just ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ways and common ways.</p>

            <p>Usually what I do is if you‚Äôre halfway done with the song than have the second drop be the first one but then change it some way. For example; add more layers and/or arps (arpeggios), make the melody be lower or higher and/or change up some automation loops, more percussion and drums.</p>

            <p>I have the same question, because after I write the first half, ending with the drop, I don‚Äôt know what to do for the next half. Often I just have it build up again, but a little different and have the 2nd drop a little different, but it feels repetitive. Help would help a lot, of course.</p>

            <p>Generally, I‚Äôll lay down a melody, build, drop, transition back into the melody, build, drop again, transition back into a little melody chorus before I end the song. You could do that too, or write a slightly different drop of the two. Your choice. And hey, if you have two UNFINISHED songs, why not try putting them together to get one ‚Äúfinished‚Äù song? Worth a try‚Ä¶!</p>
