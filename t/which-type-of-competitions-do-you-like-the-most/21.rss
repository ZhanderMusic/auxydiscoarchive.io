            <p>I just love the fact it’s keeping me in line to finish a project. MASTER PROCRASTINATOR RIGHT HERE. I usually start something then stop and forget about it because something else popped in my mind.</p>
<p>I like the short 1 minute ones, but I’d like to have a few full track 2-3+ minute pieces. It really forces you to look at a grand picture and work out a masterpiece.</p>
<p>I know it must be daunting to have to hear some of our train wrecks though xD. But hey, a lot of us hit and miss.</p>

            <p>I wish they were more consistent with timeframes of when to expect a new BTC. For a while it was every weekend. Like fridays. I like the idea of that since it gives me something to look forward to. Having a new one every Friday and having the whole weekend to complete the track.</p>
<p>I am not sure how I feel about the one minute tracks. I tend to try and condense an entire song structure down into 1 minute and it’s fun but I always wind up extending it to a full length song afterward. Maybe 2 minute tracks could work. Setting a time limit makes  sense though. I can live with it but I just feel it’s a little too limiting at times.</p>
<p>I’d like to see more things that challenge you to use a specific bpm, key or genre. I say genre because it’s always good to learn new things as producers and it gives people a chance to work in a genre they aren’t as familiar with or people really good in a particular genre have more opportunities to shine. Maybe we could see some new faces in the final lists from this. I could be wrong but I seem to notice some of the same names and certain genre styles are more favored to make the finals lists which could seem unfair to some.</p>

            <p>A remix competition, where the devs pick a project they like and compile a list of their fav remixes of that song, a collab competition.<br>
I had an idea for something called “One Minute Magic” where you have to create a song with a verse, chorus, and ending in STRICTLY 60 seconds or less.</p>

            <p>I don’t like BTC in the current form. Perfect world BTC would work like this: 1) btc section inside auxy app in dedicated section. 2) Shows list of multiple open songs and days remaining. 3) the songs to chose from are already ‘complete’ songs of sifferent genras and types, and can have overlapping timelines, so at any given time I can work on a song that I like and skip ones I don’t 4) choose song, work on it, no rules whatsoever just ‘remix’ or ‘rework’. 5) submit track from inside the app. Optionally follow comments likes etc on third party sites, soundcloud etc. 6) completed btc’s show top 5 tracks and you can download them. 7) eat pizza</p>

            <p>I like the idea of a “collab roullete” so to say where you sign up, and get paired with a rando, and then you collab.</p>

            <p>Personally it only takes me a few hours to come up with something, but I definitely see where UnashamedDev is coming from. But since the concept of BTC is making something fast, what if Auxy had a second contest type? One that is announced a few weeks in advance, but is a much larger/complicated project? Just a thought.</p>

            <p>I love Auxy’s idea for beat the clock. However, I think that it should take place every 2 to 3 weeks because sometimes it takes too long for me to make a good BTC track in a short amount of time and I have only gotten 1 feature in 13 Auxy BTCs.</p>

            <p>I think BTC is great! I personally like the challenges the best when you don’t give us very much to start with. That way everyone can take their own direction, and it’s cool to see all the different creative approaches that people take. Also, yeah, a collaboration competition sounds awesome!</p>
