    <description>so i made something out of a jig i wrote...

I&#39;ve been involved with the traditional music scene and played fiddle for a long time but I decided now to combine this modern Irish folk-inspired tune with a dance beat and a drop I had laying around. Also I was in the vicinity of a mountain literally called &quot;Snow Mountain&quot; so I named it that.
