    <title>Mixing AUXY songs with other DAWs and Software</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mixing-auxy-songs-with-other-daws-and-software/6063</link>
    <description>I started adding phone talk, white noise, rain samples, etc. In my AUXY projects a few months ago and recently I started mixing my projects in Pro Tools to try and break away from &quot;AUXY sound&quot;. Does anyone else do anything like this? 

Here&#39;s an example. This is an extended version of my BTC#24 that I mixed in pro tools. Let me know if you think it really effected the over all feel.

            <p>Um, if you mean Ableton, yeah, it has a Session view, but I use the Arrangement view because it’s much more precise.</p>

            <p>Yeah, from what I can tell it actually works kind of similarly to AUXY in the way that I think they both use loops and scenes n stuff</p>

            <p>I can relate to you with Logic. I switch completely over to Ableton because of that.<br>
Yeah, NI’s Machine is cool. I haven’t got to use it yet, but I did some studying on it, and it’s really cool as a plugin.</p>

            <p>Thanks dude, that means a lot! If you don’t mind me asking, do you feel like the level of the bass is alright? Sometime’s I’ll overcompensate turning the bass down cause I feel like a lot of people over do it.</p>

            <p>Yeah for electronic music production Pro Tools is trash lol. That’s why I only use it to mix and track. I’ve had a pretty bad experience with Logic for whatever reason. I just felt like I had to work way to hard to make things work together. I dabbled in Machine and Ableton they feel like they spit out better content easier if that makes sense.</p>

            <p>I don’t know about Ableton Live being the cause of better content, but I do know that Live has a very nice workflow that allows for creativity. Not trying to knock Pro Tools since it’s the professional standard for engineering, but in my opinion, Pro Tools is kinda stale.<br>
I love Logic and Live, and I’ve seen great things about Bitwig. All of these DAWs have something in common:<br>
They just look good. They’re interface is very easy to look at, with smooth lines, and nice colors.</p>

            <p>I usually use a DAW with Auxy. I run the audio from my iPhone (RIP my iPhone, though) to my audio interface and sync it to Ableton Live using Ableton Link.</p>
<p>My main sounds don’t usually come from Auxy, though. I usually use Auxy as a “fill” sound. Like, little melodies to make my tracks more complex.</p>

            <p>I do, mostly to mix and master the sounds. I sometimes do convert some instruments into MIDI if I feel like the Auxy app isn’t offering the sound I want.</p>
<p>P.S: some of my tracks are story-ish driven so they don’t follow a specific arrangement.</p>
<p>Also your track sounds really good, and Pro tools is Amazing. I use a basic DAW - Logic Pro</p>
