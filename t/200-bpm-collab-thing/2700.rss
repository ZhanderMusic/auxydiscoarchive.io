    <title>200 BPM Collab Thing</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/200-bpm-collab-thing/2700</link>
    <description>I was recently making this weird 200 BPM song with a precision arp that goes all the way up and down the scale with the new update, and decided I could make it into a collab song, after how fun it was to make one before this. So basically just make a little section of really whatever. I&#39;m excited to see (if anyone joins) how this might turn out!
Here&#39;s a link to the project:
