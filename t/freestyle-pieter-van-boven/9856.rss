I&#39;ve been using Auxy for ages but somehow i never posted a topic on here. I&#39;m also dropping a new album on 14-5-2018!

            <p>Thanks for the feeback! This track was created before Sweet Pads came out and even before the recent update. I wanted to keep the track minimal but now looking back on it i realize that maybe some different sounds here and there would’ve made it a bit better.</p>

            <p>Love the beat! Really love it.</p>
<p>The use of Tonsil is too obvious, too ‘Auxy’, imo – and is disappointing as a result.<br>
To me, it’s a shame the track is built around that sound – especially as there’s so little variation throughout that three minutes.</p>
<p>The subby bass and floaty synth that joins in works well though.</p>
<p>Definitely feels like it needs to break out and do something more.*</p>
<p>(Would strongly consider either reworking Tonsil to use it less ‘off-the-shelf’, or consider an alternative – possibly one of the new ‘vocal’ sounds from the Sweet Pads set, or maybe even an imported sample.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* I think a good point of reference would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk">212 by Azelia Banks</a>. Still a very simple track based around a similar groove to you, but it kicks into another gear when the main hook drops in.</p>
