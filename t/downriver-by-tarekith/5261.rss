Downriver started as a sketch I was working on using Auxy on my iPhone while wandering solo around Brussels and Amsterdam in 2016.  I reworked the core ideas quite a few times in the following months while I travelled, eventually morphing it into a more old-school breakbeat style of track. 

Ultimately I ended up keeping the main drums, bassline, and background melodies almost exactly as they were from the initial Auxy sketches.  Those were exported into Ableton Live 10, where I added some background pads and distorted chords from my DSI OB-6 and Ableton’s Wavetable synth.  Some additional percussion samples were added from my sample library to round out the rhythmic elements.  The guitar is my Taylor 814ce acoustic being processed by a TC Electronic Hall of Fame Reverb, as well as Ableton’s Echo and Pedal devices.   Final volume and dynamics control was done with DMG’s Limitless.

Hope you enjoy,
Tarekith
