    <title>Neurofunk drum and bass in Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/neurofunk-drum-and-bass-in-auxy/7666</link>
    <description>Has anyone made any neurofunk/dark dnb in Auxy? I’ve made an 8 bar loop but I’m struggling to produce those Neuro bass sounds. Any tips would be much appreciated. Also would love to hear a neuro tune if anyone has made one in Auxy</description>

            <p>Some automations go by 1/12th or 1/24th patterns and some go by 1/16th or 1/32nd patterns. Whilst this may sound fine when playing them apart, if you have triplets playing with normal patterns the beat becomes “muddy”, per se, especially at higher tempos <small>^1</small>. This could be desired, which is fine, but I usually try to separate the two so the beat is more distinguished (if that makes sense)</p>

<li>At a slower BPM, it can be used to make what’s called a polyrhythm, which is sick for experimentation <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/call_me_hand.png?v=5" title=":call_me_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":call_me_hand:">

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/PISTOL">@PISTOL</a>, I know this isn’t really a fix, but you could just turn down the volume of everything but the bass. Sounds pretty heavy when you mix it like that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_monocle.png?v=5" title=":face_with_monocle:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_monocle:"></p>
