    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/help-with-exporting-projects-resolved-with-magic-apparently/6233</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&#39;m trynna export a track&#39;s individual instruments so I can pull them up in GarageBand and better edit/ mix them n stuff. But for some reason, when I try and open the ZIP file on my computer, i get an error saying the &quot;original file was not found&quot; something like that. 

Idk what&#39;s wrong with it. Can anyone help me out?</description>
