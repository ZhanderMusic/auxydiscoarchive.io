*Who are we and what is ViperQuidex?*

We are Twizard and Hexx, ViperQuidex is an only drum and bass collective.

*What do we want to achieve with the collective?*

There are not much drum and bass producers and most of them are pretty unknown, and they deserve way more exposure. We want to help them get exposure with this collective, so they get what they deserve

*How can I submit songs?*

Thereâ€™ll be probably some questions about people saying there are already tons of collectives. But, this collective is unique, just like any other collective.
