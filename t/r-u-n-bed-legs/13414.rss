            <p>Alright i appreciate the feedback. Not sure if its what you asked for but I‚Äôve made some changes and I do like it the way it is so it is at its final state. This song took a while for it to get to its current point. It started with a simple loop using Runner from the original sound pack. I took a couple different pieces that I have had and added them in and started messing around a bit and came up with the main layout and posted what I had. When I added the bass line I decided to make it a lead also. The ending fades out with the same lead but I took the middle section and split it in two and had different instruments playing each sound.</p>

            <p>Track‚Äôs pretty cool. As for feedback, I would suggest slightly highpassing the kick drum during the parts where there is no bass ‚Äî it makes the mix unclear. Maybe change your Shifted Snare to something else, right now it sounds kinda weird &amp; doesn‚Äôt fit in the mix (includes lower frequencies that stand out). If you want to fill up the mix better, add a bass and give the drums and other elements more low frequencies.</p>
