    <title>Who Here Performs Live? Anything to Share?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/who-here-performs-live-anything-to-share/3201</link>
    <description>This account represents two people (Saydyy Kuo &amp; Oscar) from the ethno-fusion group UDAGAN.  We’ve been using Auxy a bit more in our creative process recently.

Both our backgrounds are in performance.   Curious to hear about other Auxy user’s involvement with performing!

Saydyy Kuo is a native performer of Ethno-Folk from the North Siberian Republic Of Sakha.  Here she’s performing with folk group ‘Ayarkhaan’:

Oscar has done a lot of work as a session bass player, playing live with and recording with many artists in the UK &amp; Ireland.  This is him performing in this role in Northwest UK (playing bass):

Together we’re working on our collaborative project UDAGAN (http://UDAGANuniverse.com).  There are some clips from our most recent performance together in this Twitter moment:

What live stuff are other people doing?  Any links to share?</description>

            <p>I’m a DJ, so I’m used to performing live, and I’ve started to do do Live PA (Live Production Act) which is basically being a one man band.</p>
<p>I have a question, though.</p>
<p>How’re you two performing, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/udgn">@UDGN</a> ?<br>
Are you guys a straight band, or is there some forms of Live PA in your set?</p>
<p>If it be the latter, Auxy could be a nice piece of gear to use, in combination with Ableton Live and Ableton Link, and MIDI clock out of Live into some synths and samplers/drum machines.</p>
