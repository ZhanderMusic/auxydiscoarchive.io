I was watching this video for the 5th or 6th time until I decided to give the soundtrack a listen since I liked it. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwe0S4s0EAE

It doesn&#39;t say if it was made in the app, but while listening, I&#39;m pretty sure I heard a few Auxy elements. Didn&#39;t even recognize them at first because that&#39;s just how far the app has come. Here, give it a listen yourself-

Pretty glad the use of Auxy is extending to video production. (The video has 8 million views, too!)
Got something similar to share? I&#39;d love to hear from you.</description>

            <p>His first song, Stolen Kill, has obvious RAC drumkits and Silo! So much silo!!! Not sure what the main melody is, though. But it’s definitely using Auxy sounds.</p>

            <p>Sorry for being a bit skeptical last night concerning these tracks. The only reason I asked was because some of Auxy’s signature sound isn’t unique to Auxy in a way. Especially the sounds developed by 7 Skies. However, I clearly see now that I was wrong xD</p>
<p>By the way, I actually listened to them now since, of course, it was so late at night when I saw this that I didn’t have time to. It’s definitely Auxy. Glad to see the use of Auxy in this way for certain.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty convinced it’s Auxy.</p>
<p>Too many quintessentially Auxy sounds.<br>
Pretty convinced by time I heard the fingersnap.</p>
<p>The choice of sounds just seem like someone selecting from the pre-V5 Auxy.</p>
<p>(The bass is the only thing that isn’t immediately recognisable to me.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jelly is based from an analogue synth, so it’s likely it was something related to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The particular blend of tone and resonance convinces me it’s actually Jelly with a softened attack, etc…</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Not hugely important either way. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Depends on the drum kit. Since the new ones are all licensed from BlackOctopus, and they’re rather popular, they don’t only sell sound through Auxy.</p>

<p>7 Skies sells presets created for both Serum, Massive and other VSTs through <a href="https://www.standalone-music.com/">https://www.standalone-music.com/</a>. It could be that one of those presets were used, but considering Jelly was specifically designed for Auxy from analogue equipment, I’d agree it is likely made using auxy, at least partially.</p>

            <p>i don’t have any of the piano packs lol.<br>
But the drum kit for sure is Auxy.</p>
<p>I dont recognize the synth used tho, so it might all be a combo of Auxy + some other DAW</p>

            <p>lot’s of sounds. And for some reason, Auxy songs just have such a distinct sound to them. You kind of hear them after working with the app for a long time.</p>

I don’t know about you, but if that isn’t Auxy’s piano, then I don’t know what else it could be</p>

            <p>oh sh*t i remember watching one of these guys’ vids a few months back.  The Zone was the name.</p>
<p>idk if it was auxy tho.  A lot of the sounds in the app are somewhat “generic” and you can hear them in a lot of different tracks, but hey, if it is Auxy, that’d be pretty cool</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity, which elements did you particularly hear?</p>

            <p>I was watching this video for the 5th or 6th time until I decided to give the soundtrack a listen since I liked it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nwe0S4s0EAE?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/nwe0S4s0EAE</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t say if it was made in the app, but while listening, I’m pretty sure I heard a few Auxy elements. Didn’t even recognize them at first because that’s just how far the app has come. Here, give it a listen yourself-</p>

<p>Pretty glad the use of Auxy is extending to video production. (The video has 8 million views, too!)<br>
Got something similar to share? I’d love to hear from you.</p>
