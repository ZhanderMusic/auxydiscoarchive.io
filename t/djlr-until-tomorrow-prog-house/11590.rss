    <title>DJLR - Until Tomorrow (Prog House)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/djlr-until-tomorrow-prog-house/11590</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I’ve been really inactive lately, and I’ll be posting further news about my inactivity later on in the month. 

But for now, here’s some progressive House.

Ps, this was supposed to be finsihed a few weeks ago but I purposely didn’t do anything to it.

            <p>Wow, nice intro. The pad in the beginning was a little too basic, but damn your arps and synths are just on point and overall pleasing to the ears. Basic, but nice drums. Wow, that breakdown was nice with the piano. Oooohh that build up was smooth and had a very nice riser. Ah, classic fill before the hook. I love how you don’t just have one lead, but different ones acting like each other. It just sounds really nice. Nice second build up! That sounded perfect with the drums coming in. It blended in nicely progressing towards that hook. Wow I love that bouncy bass hook. That outro was perfect. Just an overall masterpiece. Those snare fills bring back memories lol</p>
