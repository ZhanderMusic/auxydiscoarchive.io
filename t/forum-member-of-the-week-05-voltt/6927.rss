            <p>Ok so unfortunately I didn’t have time to listen to all of your tracks, but I listened to a good few of them. I like your style dude! Your housey stuff is great, especially the ones with darker bigroom vibes (I like dark <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">); Horus and Tokyo are my favorites. You are a really versatile producer too; your progressive and future bass tracks are great as well (especially Reflections and Moonlight).<br>
I agree with some feedback above about overlayering your songs; you can see that the waveform of High Speed is at max width throughout the entire track. Great track nonetheless <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Keep it up my man!</p>

            <p>Sorry for the late response, but I’ve got some feedback for ya <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a>. Really like that chill percussion sound and piano chords in Moonlight. Your collabs with Andrew Adams are really really nice, I think my favorite is Heroes. Listened to the Journey, awesome job, I think some ducker and more bass would be great though. Loving Voyager!</p>
<p>It was fun collabing with you btw <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p>Hey Voltt, I focused on your own tracks, rather than collabs.</p>
<p><strong>Voyager -</strong> Easy to listen to, with a calmness to it, plus catchy drums; Kept my interest for 5+ mins with constant changes and flourishes, which isn’t easy to do.</p>
<p><strong>Lakewood Pier -</strong> Slower pace, atmospheric and more emotional. Loved the start. Was pleased when the silk in the middle stopped, as it was a bit distracting and didn’t match the <span class="hashtag">#Chill</span> tag, but another solid track.</p>
<p><strong>High Speed -</strong> Enjoyed the buildup in the intro which matches the title perfectly. Made me think of the futuristic Wipeout racing game on Playstation.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey -</strong> Quality intro.  Was interested to see how it would morph into Dum’n’Bass and you made that transition really smoothly.  Well controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections -</strong> Mr Moo mentioned the opening chords sounded familiar. I had the same thought. But only for the first few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Moonlight -</strong> Nice Piano chords</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoy the way you deliver a feeling of lightness in your music, with great drums and interesting builds (Builds seem to play a key role in your stuff). And as someone else mentioned, the quality of your music is improving, even over the last few months. Good on ya!</p>

            <p>Oh! I also meant to say, one thing to watch is your bassy levels. I was listening in the truck and it felt like the panels were vibrating. Bass good, too much bad (like ice cream, believe me, there is such a thing as too much).</p>
<p>Just watch for it overpowering other instruments like drums and destroying your breathing room in the mix. No specific examples popping out just be cognizant <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>AIGHT: Goes without saying Lakewood Pier very good. Voyager is great, the melodies and way you play the bass off them gels very nicely.</p>
<p>Big time like Recovery, has heard it before and liked it on SC but the push / pull beat and overall vibe hooked me right in.</p>
<p>Not sure if I’d heard The Journey before but this is another really good one with great emotion.</p>
<p>Ah yes I remember ROCKER now, I didn’t realize you’d done so much with FinLayers. Good stuff!</p>
<p>Of course goes without saying Heroes is another great track, was one of the first I’d heard out of the community with such broken up progression (in a good way, like dropping out everything for two seconds for a piano fill, nice)</p>
<p>You can tell too from your older stuff to the newer there is growth which is great. Not that the older stuff is bad, but it’s apparent you’ve become more comfortable with the toolset which is super important in developing a more cohesive and personal sound.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what else you put out and omg what a sin, I just realized I wasn’t following you lol wtf. Well that’s been fixed!!!</p>
<p>Great job man <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Ok, gonna start off with Horus.<br>
First off, this song is freaking amazing.<br>
It’s a great song with so much flare and power. And it’s really a breath of fresh air, pretty unique style.<br>
Next, Voyager.<br>
While this song isn’t really my type of thing, (And also because the new update makes all old songs sound like trash in comparison) I can see what you were going for, and I think you pulled it off pretty well.</p>
<div class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-member-of-the-week-05-voltt/6927/50">spoiler</a></div>
<p>And to end us off, Lakewood Pier.<br>
Buildup is pretty good. Though the silk and whack snare at the drop are a bit too loud. Also don’t agree with some of the instrument choices in there. Overall good song, but once again, not really something I would listen to.</p>
<p>also rocker is really good</p>
