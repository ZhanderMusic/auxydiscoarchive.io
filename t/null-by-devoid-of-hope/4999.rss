    <title>Null - by Devoid of Hope</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/null-by-devoid-of-hope/4999</link>
    <description>made with Auxy and a bunch of pedals in GB. 
Also my SC for the noisier and more heavily altered tracks.

            <p>And with out a set of speakers or decent set of headphones a lot is lost. A sacrifice to be made to get the experience sadly.</p>

            <p>Thanx bud <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand/2.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:t2:"><br>
On this track I exported into GB and messed with the actual track. Then on top of that I recorded into an irig2 into my iPad and ran it mainly through the eco pedal and the heavenly chorus pedal. Adjusting through out. So it’s two tracks on top of each other essentially.<br>
This track I ran each auxy instrument through the irig2 and used a multitude of different pedals.</p>

            <p>Well, that was certainly a real palette cleanser, after the chilled synthwave I’ve been working on. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Liked and reposted. Interesting and different. A listening experience.<br>
Had good headphones on. Not sure how well it would work without good speakers/headphones. I imagine you’d miss a lot of the detail.</p>
<p>Glad that music makers like you are getting involved with Auxy. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Interested to know whether you split out the stems and ran certain parts through certain pedals, or ran the whole thing through all the pedals.</p>
<p>Also, what pedals (exactly)? Got a few of my own that I’m not making enough use of.</p>
