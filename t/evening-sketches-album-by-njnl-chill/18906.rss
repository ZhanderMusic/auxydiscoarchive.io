    <title>Evening Sketches [Album] - By NJNL [Chill]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/evening-sketches-album-by-njnl-chill/18906</link>
    <description>The twelve songs that make up this album are in chronological order of when each Auxy project was created. I think of each track as a page in an “audio sketchbook” that I would work on to wind down for the evening. Hence the album title.

I have very little knowledge of all the sub-genres out there for electronic music. I don’t really know which genre these tracks fit into. Most tracks are rhythmic, layered, and moody.

Thanks for listening.
