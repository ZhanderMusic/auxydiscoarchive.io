    <title>How to change the tempo one step at a time</title>

    <description>Hello there Auxy forums!
Right now, I have a bit of difficulty changing the bpm.
The current system requires me to drag the bpm slider.
However, the slider is quite small for such a wide range of numbers. It would be much easier if I could simply tap on the current bpm number to pull up a text/number input and type my own bpm. If the number was too high or too low, it could just throw me a blue message saying something along the lines of “Invalid bpm number! Please try again.” I’ve had the app for more than half a year at this point and still have this minor inconvenience.
Thanks for reading.</description>
