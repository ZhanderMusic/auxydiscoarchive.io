    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. The judge this week is @Dadmother 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

<p>All in all, this was an amazing TotW! I commend each and every one of you for your submissions. They made the judging QUITE difficult. I‚Äôve been going back through the tracks, and wanted to give each of you personalized feedback from what I thought when listening to each of your tracks. SERIOUSLY great job! Thanks for giving me such a tough time judging because it also provided with excellent tunes! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p><big> <strong>Track of the ‚ì¶eek <span class="hashtag">#15</span></strong> </big></p>
<p>The judge this week was <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dadmother">@Dadmother</a> and he‚Äôs  chosen the winner for week 15: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThis is one of the most stacked submission lists I‚Äôve seen since Track of the Week began, and I‚Äôve had quite a difficult time choosing a winner. Each project was full of talent and creativity. For this week, I choose <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/peregrihn">@Peregrihn</a>‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://soundcloud.com/peregrihn/isles" rel="nofollow noopener">Isles</a>‚Äù. It takes you on a kind of sonic journey. The mix is spot-on from start to finish, and each little perc and twinkle of ambience sounds deliberate, yet effortless. The whole track is very cohesive, and it really takes on a life of its own.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congrats Peregrihn, you get a  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:">  icon next to your forum name. And your name is recorded as a <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961">Track of the Week Winner </a>.</p>
<p>The thread for next weeks competition will be posted soon.</p>

            <p>Well, here goes nothing. I tried my best. I tried to make this track a little bit more melancholy. Maybe by the end of it you‚Äôll be feeling a little‚Ä¶thoughtful.<br>
Thanks and good luck to all!<br>
