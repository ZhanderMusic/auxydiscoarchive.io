&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #24: @anon73773654  &lt;/big&gt; 
 
 &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt;anaB  (Previously FroYo) is an American producer and a regular contributor to this forum, where shes consistently supported the featured artists. 

Her first EP &quot;[Excursion](https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/sets/excursion)&quot; was released in May on Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, Google Play and Amazon. It&#39;s worth a listen and includes tracks featuring @Goxenar &amp; Hayvn. [[Fan Link](https://sanab.fanlink.to/excursion)]

**Which instruments do you play?** Clarinet to an advanced level and Ukelele. She&#39;d like to see soft electric guitars in Auxy: - &quot;Not the heavy rock kind (because almost no one here will benefit from that :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ) but the calming kind that can be used in chill music.&quot; 

**Who is your fav Auxy producer?**   &quot;Every awesome person who makes Auxy… so basically everyone here.&quot;  
 
 **Week starting: 11 June, 2018.** 
 - Please listen to at least one :sb:  track (or more) 
 - Provide at least one Soundcloud comment / feedback about her music during their week.

            <p>I totally agree with the feedback above: - The quality of your music has clearly improved &amp; you’re a well-liked, positive part of our community.</p>
<p>You’ve found your niche, with chilled tracks and understated drums.  And you’ve done some awesome collabs.</p>
<p>My fav tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/tranquility-ft-hayvn">Tranquility (Ft Haven)</a> - This is my overall fav.  Leaving room for a vocal requires a whole different approach to laying out the track. You two smashed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/excursion-ft-goxenar">Excursion (Ft Goxenar)</a>  - Sweet guitar strumming into. Can see the improvement from the strumming in Tides, with more varied and interesting layering, automation and pacing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/perception">Perception</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/sets/amethyst">Amethyst (with Cosmic Superior)</a> - Both are chilled out, nicely understated and easy listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/alleviate">Alleviate</a> - Love the intro.  And the way you didn’t just keep adding instruments; You just included what was needed. Nice restraint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being our 24th Forum Member of the Week SanaB!  It’s good to have you here.</p>

First of all, you’re legendary <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">. I’m really impressed by how much you’ve improved over the last few months, your tracks are quality and keep getting better. I’m a big fan of your use of drums and percussion in all your tracks, they really add to the structure of your tracks. In terms of genres, I really like the more poppy stuff you make, such as Tranquility with HAYVN, which is great, as well as your latest deep house track Perception, which is probably my favorite track of yours, it’s fire <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:">. You should definitely continue experimenting with genres, it has worked out really well for you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .<br>
I’m really curious where your style will go, keep it up!</p>

            <p>You’re constantly improving your music with every release you make. One of my favorites is ‘Tranquility’ with HAYVN, that one sounds way better than most pop music right now. Your chill music never ceases to impress, either, especially Perception and Amethyst. Also you’re a really nice, supportive person in general. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Wowwww it’s your week! Congratulations, legendary SanaB <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=5" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=5" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:"><br>
Honestly like it’s amazing seeing how you have progressed in your music—I first listened to your track Believe, and since then you’ve gone so far, managing to develop a future chill-esque style. Like you even got a release on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cosmic_superior/macro-03" rel="nofollow noopener">Cosmic Superior</a> and made your own label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/melolabel" rel="nofollow noopener">melo</a>… you’re definitely going places.</p>
<p>Keep up the awesome work and don’t let writers’ block get in the way <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/tornait">@tornait</a> Yeah she’s supportive af</p>

            <p>Eyyy! Sana’s turn! Sana, I’d like to just say that I’m more than a bit jelly of you now. Your musical prowess has just absolutely exploded, and now I’m left in the dust. I remember when you only had like 50 followers on SC, and now you’re on Spotify and Apple Music… Man, I feel wack. But if there’s one thing you’re really good at, it’s being quite supportive.</p>

            <p>I’ll admit that around a year ago, when I first saw the profile ‘Maverix’ with like 3 followers commenting on my latest track ‘Hypernova,’ I didn’t know that the same producer would evolve into a Grade A+ auxy superproducer <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:">.</p>
<p>congrats on the feature, loved your new song, keep up the great work!</p>

            <p>Your track “Tides” makes me feel like I’m dreaming that I’m floating on a small cloud, and everything has been huge-ified, and I’m just floating around on my cloud exploring everything, lol.
