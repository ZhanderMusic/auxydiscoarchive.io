    <title>Do my SC tracks seem quiet? (What am I doing wrong?)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/do-my-sc-tracks-seem-quiet-what-am-i-doing-wrong/7364</link>
    <description>Every now and then, an SC upload of mine seems to play more quietly than tracks by other people.

For example, my recent Sketch 34 thing seems noticeably quieter, _to my ears_.

https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/sketch-34-lofi-beats-no1

I&#39;d appreciate it anyone here would pop over to that track, (especially @blakkaz, @iammane and @NickElle)   give it a quick listen at its fullest part (~3:30) and let me know if it seemed quiet compared to other people&#39;s SC tracks.

(Don&#39;t feel the need to listen to the whole thing. It&#39;s just to get feedback on volume, not about plays.)

&amp;nbsp;
The second part of this query would be, if it does sound comparatively quiet, what can I do to &#39;correct&#39; it?

(Afaik, SC doesn&#39;t normalise uploads.
I replaced the file a short while ago. On the previous version, the dB level seemed to be peaking at -1dB [pretty standard, afaik] and played at a reasonable volume when playing the WAV locally. It just sounded quiet/weak on SC. So, I bumped it up to ~+3dB peak in the hope that it would make the SC upload seem less quiet. Not sure if it&#39;s a caching issue, but it doesn&#39;t seem any louder to my ears.)


&amp;nbsp;
Thanks.</description>

            <p>Yeah I’m thinking I’d like to be able to replace files more than anything else. There’s been a few times I discovered way after the fact something was out of whack in the mix, or after time I just HATED it and would have loved to make a quick fix.</p>
<p>Also, being able to not be choosy about what stays up and comes down would be nice</p>

<p>I grabbed it primarily for the ability to replace files (because my stuff is all still WIP).<br>
It stops me being too precious which, as a recovering perfectionist, is a good thing.</p>
<p>Without the Pro account, I probably wouldn’t be pushing out the Sketches, which I enjoy doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The additional stats are merely interesting now, but will be useful when I start properly pushing things.</p>

            <p>OK, had another (calmer) look at the BandLab mastering process.</p>
<p>Had to Google <em>bandlab mastering</em> to discover there’s actually a how-to video, buried in the blog. (As mentioned, nothing in the actual Help pages, even though Mastering has its own Help section.)</p>
<p>Anyhoo, shoddy UX aside, I found it – and have now (auto-)mastered a couple of tracks, and been able to download the mastered version! Huzzah!</p>
<p>Probably going to spend some time this weekend running some of my stuff through the process and updating the SC files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks to each of you for your input. Appreciated.</p>

            <p>I’d already done that repeatedly (I’ve had an unused account for a little while), but I couldn’t convince myself that the mixdown was actually the same as the CD mastered version I’d selected earlier.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the mixdown download process that stated that it would be the using the mastering setting I’d selected earlier. And I’d lost the ability to tell with my own ears.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no way to change to another setting (clarity or bass enhanced), which it said would be possible. (I didn’t want to change it, but it would at least let me know if a mastering preset was still in effect.)</p>
<p>Basically, after that initial mastering option, mastering was never mentioned again.</p>
<p>I looked for mastering in the Help section, but it only spoke about ‘Why mastering is a good thing’; nothing about the process of selecting/changing presets or where to find mastering settings.</p>
<p>The UX/production logic seemed screwy. Mastering <em>then</em> importing it as part of a multi-track production to <em>begin</em> working on it.  I’d thought mastering was something you only did at the very end - the final process before final output, because it’s something that accounts for the entire production, when all elements are in there together.</p>
<p>The logic seems broken (to me) and that’s confusing me as to where I should be looking</p>

            <p>This much is clear to me, I suck at mixing.</p>
<p>Tried the pink noise technique, but didn’t end up with the shape of frequency spread as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerIGRBoIzw">the video</a>.</p>
<p>I had to ramp up the volume of several instruments in Auxy (out of proportion) just to get them to be audible ‘just above the pink noise’ as suggest in the video.</p>
<p>F****d if I know if it made any difference. Still sounds quiet to me (compared to, say, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/austin_haga/broken-glass">this Austin Haga track</a>). Feel like I’m going round in circles.</p>

<p>Guess I’ll have a play with this track (and Nightcrawler, apparently) later today, running each through the pink noise technique thang.</p>

    When of the best tips I was given as a young engineer was the pink noise mixing technique. 
Plenty of articles and videos online covering it, and really worth 5 minutes of your time if you don’t already know it!

            <p>What’s the pink noise trick? Yeah it definitely could be a problem with some normalization somewhere though. You exported the wave, that sounded good and then you uploaded that to SC? Or uploaded to SC from Auxy directly?</p>
<p>I have no proof there is a difference there but the more variables you can remove from the process would probably help.</p>
<p>Ahhhhh yes, the loudness war <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I’ll be upfront with you - I didn’t even notice this track was quieter until you mentioned it, because I turned up the volume lol, and I’m ok with that. I’ll take something with an overall quiet volume but LOADED with dynamics any day of the week. Nothing makes me sadder than cracking into a track and the wave form looks like this:</p>

<p>Without really looking at a nice wave form it looks like something is peaking and then it’s throwing off the whole mix. This is where I usually get kind of f’ed up with compression, even after all these years I still don’t fully understand. But, if SC or maybe even Auxy is doing some kind of limiting on the export/upload, and there is something in the track that peaks or continuously peaks it’s crushing the rest of the mix?</p>
<p>I agree this one in particular is quieter, even compared to Nightcrawler. If it’s cool locally then SC must be doing something to it in the upload/conversion process <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>On that track, I added the outro sound clip in Audacity* then output from there, but I hadn’t touched the amplification/normalisation until today. (* Could have done it in Auxy, but I was just rapidly auditioning different sound clips and I already had Audacity open, so…)</p>
<p>So, everything apart from that outro sound clip is 100% Auxy.</p>
<p>Even with the dB bump, the transients still seem clear and the wave still has dynamic range, from the look of the waveform in Audacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As mentioned, the WAV played locally feels comparable (volume-wise) to 3rd-party tracks on SC. It’s just when it goes onto SC that it seems quiet by the same comparison.</p>
