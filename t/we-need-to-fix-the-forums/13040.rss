    <title>We need to fix the forums!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/we-need-to-fix-the-forums/13040</link>
    <description>People have been scared to talk about this, as they don’t want a bad rep. But, it needs to be brought up, because the community has been severely damaged, and these forums have been slowly dying. I remember when I first joined, there were constantly discussions going on everywhere. Now it&#39;s just 80% a self promo place, that doesn&#39;t even work good for promo.

So why have the forums been getting more and more inactive? Well, here’s a couple pretty solid reasons that a lot of people that I’ve talked to can agree with. If you are a mod or a dev, please keep an open mind.

- **_No off-topic discussion._** Even the #random category is strictly Auxy/music production conversation based. The meme thread is the best example of this. It was removed because it was  an off-topic thread. This thread being removed is a good place to mark the beginning of this website’s slow demise. If you think about the users who frequented that thread, you’d notice that most of them are no longer active on here, and more active on discord, where they CAN post memes.

- **_Lack of community events._** We all know that BTCs have basically ended. We only had a single one this year. If the discussions I brought up in the last point are what keep users here, then BTCs and other events are what bring them here. BTCs brought likely hundreds of people here, and even if 1% of them stay active, that’s still more people than are currently active. I know the devs might not have much time to run BTCs but they could at least let someone else do it (plenty of people here would be willing to). All they’d have to do is promote it in the app. Fwiw, it doesn’t even have to be BTCs. The March House challenge hosted by @MisterMaster was a nice “official” challenge to participate in. If it was promoted in the app, it could have brought many new people here.

Are there any reasons for these problems to persist? They could be easily fixed at no expense other than a little bit of time. 

Thanks.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Was talking to AKAbillposters/Heathen AKA on soundcloud and he said this:</p>
<p>'Fwiw, I still currently use Auxy as my go-to tool for early composition and development. It’s still a good tool, though I’d like to switch to a more powerful option. I do feel kinda trapped in Auxy by having so many tracks and ideas stored in it. The work/time required to get them all exported in a usable/portable format is daunting.</p>
<p>With a few key enhancements, (sound pack quality*, sound design/control incl. proper ADSR across all sounds, etc…) I’d likely be happy to stick with it, as it has a pretty good workflow, imo. Especially for a mobile/on-the-go tool, which is important for me, as I still ‘need’ to have a tool that I can use to kickstart something whenever/wherever inspiration strikes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent sound packs seem quite lazy, with most sounding like tweaked versions of older sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t mean to sound mercenary about the forum, but at the end of the day, I wasn’t getting what I was hoping for from the community. I don’t feel like I was getting the kind of engagement that would help me grow as a music maker. I also felt like I was giving more than I was getting back. I tried to elevate the knowledge sharing and discussion and the lack of support that was getting (and the lack of meaningful engagement from the dev team with the community and product discussion) frustrated me, which came out in less-than-constructive ways.</p>
<p>I still consider the issues with the forum, the product, the marketing, the brand, etc… to be very ‘fixable’ and consider Auxy to be a product/company with a lot of potential. What could/should(?) be done still seems pretty clear to me (though I’m less ‘invested’ now, mainly from not being immersed in the community, so I’m less frustrated by it.)<br>
I think the Auxy team have enough core resources to try to build Auxy into a pretty cool brand and product/content ecosystem. I’m not sure why they haven’t, but hey…</p>
<p>But, hey, maybe this is all stuff they’re now working on, though I only know what pops up as an in-app notification, as I don’t look in on the forum.</p>
<p>Either way, I’m not currently planning to return to the forum… assuming I’d even be allowed back in, which is unlikely. ;)’</p>
<p>-AKA<br>
Didn’t know where else to put this, so here you go.</p>

<p>Okay hold on, first of all, Auxy 7 might not be a theoretical update. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/we-need-to-fix-the-forums/13040/300">spoiler</a></span> it might be a game-changer. The next level of Auxy.</p>
<p>And second of all, the topic I made “Do you have ideas for Auxy 7?” Might be a part of something else. If it wasn’t for lenberg, he would’ve said something about Auxy 7.</p>
<p>And last but not least, I do love Auxy a lot but since Auxy 6 came out, gotta say there were two mistakes that they made &amp; that is “Unaccessible sounds &amp; Removing the demo sounds that were so last year”. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/we-need-to-fix-the-forums/13040/300">spoiler</a></span> And that was like a prison.</p>
<p>Look if I was lenberg I would simply make Auxy 7 after a month. I’m not agitating or being unreasonable to any of you. I’m just trying to make some stuff for some ideas for Auxy 7. Thanks!!</p>

<p>What? Aside from maybe you, hardly anyone is going to completely stop using the app until this theoretical update happens. It’s still an amazing app. I think a lot of people might be caught up in what it could be, not what it is now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking a step back, though, it seems a bit unfair to be criticized for not having everyday public conversations with users.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>…I’m sorry if this sounds a bit snappy, but aren’t devs <em>supposed</em> to keep in touch with their audiences? Even if it’s not daily, they should at least do it weekly, or even biweekly. An occasional visit here and there makes people lose trust in the developers. (It’s what happens to game developers all the time.) Give folks teasers of upcoming features, tease upcoming sound packs, or even tease who’s <em>making</em> the pack, just something to tide folks over!</p>
<p>But sometimes the devs bounce back, like No Man’s Sky did. I really want Auxy to bounce back, too…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me it feels like some of you have grown your skills and expectations beyond the scope of Auxy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t personally agree with this sentiment. But that’s just me. I want to see Auxy grow into something even better than it currently is. To want it to be better is not necessarily expecting more than what Auxy’s “scope” is not a bad thing (and if that “scope” is to make users not want to use it that’s a horrible <em>horrible</em> way of doing business).</p>
<p>My complaints about the workflow changes in Auxy 6 may fall under this, but it is certainly not the whole picture and I do not appreciate my legitimate concerns for the inspiration and innovation that the app brought to the table being tarnished by disingenuous and, to be quite blunt, predatory monetization practices.</p>
<p>That is the real reason as to why my subscription lapsed and I have no intention to renew unless necessary (again due to the awful paywalling), the other reasons were me explaining additional reasons as to why I came to the conclusion that I needed to look elsewhere. I never wanted to. But I couldn’t sit back and let what I felt to be a terrible thing persist.</p>
<p>I kindly ask that you restore the thread I had made, as it is important to address the legitimate concerns I have for the app instead of brushing it under the rug.</p>

            <p>So where do we go from here?</p>
<p>We will keep the forum open as long as it seems to create value for people. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> has been doing a fantastic job keeping everything nice and clean, so things seem to run smoothly.</p>
<p>However, the forum is, and will become, what you decide to make it. Want more competitions? Start one! Want more feedback on tracks? Give feedback! Etc.</p>
<p>Happy to help by changing the overall structure if that makes sense.</p>

            <p>I am here! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=9" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>
<p>What we care about is to help and inspire people to become better music makers. The intention of starting the forum was to give people a place where they could learn, get inspired, find collaborators and get feedback on their work. It has also been a way for us to learn more about the people using the app and get quality feedback. Looking back, I think it has been a great investment and a vital part of developing Auxy to where it is today.</p>
<p>While adding a social aspect to music making is a fantastic proposition, it is inherently hard to do well in practice. It usually works on a small scale, but it is hard to bring in lots of people and keep the interactions valuable and sane. Except if you are e.g. TikTok and make the network itself your main focus. For us, though, we have not found a way to go from “a nice place for hardcore Auxy fans” to something that creates value for the broader user base.</p>
<p>I have been going through all your post from the last couple of days and collected various topics that seem to really upset some of you. I might address some of these topics specifically later, but in general, they all seem to stem from a set of misaligned expectations.</p>
<p>For instance, some people are really upset by the fact that I am not posting stuff here as frequently as I used to and not addressing every question or concern directly. This is obviously because I was more active in the early days, which has raised your expectations to a certain level. And this is obviously my fault. Taking a step back, though, it seems a bit unfair to be criticized for not having everyday public conversations with users. We still keep track of what is said in the forum and we always answer all incoming emails. I think that is a pretty high bar for most app developers.</p>
<p>The same goes for general app complaints. To me it feels like some of you have grown your skills and expectations beyond the scope of Auxy. This is fine! Maybe it is time to try some new tools? Experiment. Find new collaborators and ways to share your music. Whatever you do, stop wasting your creativity and energy on being upset by the lack of certain features in Auxy. It is not helpful to neither us nor yourself.</p>

            <p>To me, the forums seem like a place where you can find older topics for help with issues or new things for production. Also, you can keep up with some artists’ progress in the promotion channels and see their releases occasionally. If you’re looking for more fun things to do and to have fun talking to other people, join any number of discord servers. The Auxy Collective server is at the top, in my opinion, and people are quite active over there. Memes, genuine chat, promotion, feedback, and weekly feedback streams on the server are great, but I don’t think much could actually replace the disco.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wouldn’t totally say to just delet the whole disco.  It’s at least a good searchable community that you can find if you google “auxy” to which we can then introduce them to places like the collective discord page where people are actually active.<br>
But that being said, it does need a huge overhaul of things, starting with management.  Currently the disco has 3 admins, all of whom have pretty much disappeared leaving the 1 janitor, icsleepers/iammane, to actually take care of the place to which they might as well just dip out too because it’s a whole lotta extra stress to maintain a community who’s leaders seem like they couldn’t care less.</p>

            <p>The whole intention of this place was to help others. Not become some weird social media. Or a place to ignite controversy.</p>
<p>Time after time I’ve heard about this place being “uninviting, cancerous, or difficult”. You can probably follow the trail back to a few select users who thankfully aren’t as active/banned.</p>
<p>The only way we could “fix” the forum would be getting rid of it, currently it doesn’t seem to post any real value and it takes resources to keep this place on.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/aqzi">@Aqzi</a> <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/EVERANGE">@EVERANGE</a>  Akabill wasn’t banned for being “opinionated” on a whim, apparently there was a lot of discussion with him internally. He enjoyed being a pain in the ass.</p>
