    <title>Why aren&#39;t you on Spotify, etc…?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/why-arent-you-on-spotify-etc/8093</link>
    <description>I, like many here, have not put my stuff up on Spotify, iTunes, etc… (yet).

I hint at my reasons [here](https://disco.auxy.co/t/to-release-on-a-record-label-or-not/8092/1), but I&#39;m wondering…

Why aren&#39;t you on Spotify, etc…?

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I received an email from Amuse indicating that they were unable to retrieve my song files (I used Google Drive option) and that my submission failed. They suggested using DropBox as their servers receive the files directly from DropBox servers.  So I resubmitted all of my songs using DropBox. Got an email this morning indicating that it was now done correctly. Still waiting for approval but glad to know that bit was resolved.  Moral: If you sign up with Amuse, upload songs from DropBox, not Google Drive…and save yourself some time/headache.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> Read this post and decided to check out Amuse (as I trust your opinion/judgment).  I scanned the T’s &amp; C’s and the app reviews on the App Store and felt pretty comfortable so I signed up and submitted some songs. They’re in review now so we’ll see how it goes.  I figured I’ve got nothing to lose so why not give it a try.  I’ve always been doing this for myself (and writing songs I would want to listen to) but I also love sharing what I’ve created with others so if this could make that easier, I’m down. Don’t have any delusions of grandeur that there will be any financial windfall but knowing I will get 100% of the earnings (how do you spend a fraction of a penny? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) with Amuse was appealing.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s ludicrous. Knowing where your followers are is really valuable, as they’re your more dedicated listeners/fans.</p>
<p>I’m surprised artists haven’t been banging down Spotify’s door to push them to make follower geo stats happen (and generally a good raft of follower data).</p>
<p>(Funnily enough, I hear that Spotify are currently hiring UXers in the London office. Seems like they need it.)</p>

<p>Don’t try and do it on your phone. I did that and all it gave me was the option to link to my Twitter account, which I had just made. I heard nothing back for weeks…<br>
I finally decided to try it on a computer and it gave me the option to add any links I want, so I added SoundCloud and Instagram. Also make sure your email address is visible on those accounts. I finally did that and got verified in under 24 hours.</p>

            <p>Yes. They want to know that you are a real person that has legit ties to your work. I don’t think they care who you are, just that your not opposed to putting your real identity out there to them.</p>
<p>I gave them my personal Facebook and my soundcloud and it took maybe two weeks.</p>
<p>They don’t post it anywhere. I just think a real person looks at your links and makes a judgement if they think you are legitimately you.</p>

<p>Are you a subscriber?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yep. Maybe why they don’t push promotions at me. Maybe.</p>
<p>Have you tried the Release Radar and Weekly Discovery playlists?<br>
How well are they working for you, in terms of making good, relevant recommendations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I may know that there are a cluster of my fans in London for example, but I don’t know what to do with that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that question is the same throughout the music industry… <em>gig</em>.<br>
(Gigs and appearances - and mercy - are where the main money comes from these days.)</p>
<p>If the cluster is big enough, why not try to set up an appearances? Doesn’t have to be a kinder national tourist. The gig just needs to pay for itself - or at least be a good investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The key there would be to ensure you have enough online presence elsewhere, such as your own website or some place where you can push news out to listeners and communicate with them. Get your social on. Facebook page and definitely Twitter, at least.</p>
<p>Basically, places where listeners/fans can ‘Follow’ you.</p>
<p>(Does Spotify give you a geographical breakdown on Following numbers?)</p>
<p>As you point out, there are no/limited communication tools for artists and listeners in Spotify. It’s purely about building listener numbers through output.</p>
<p>(Aside: Is your Spotify artist bio as good as it could/should be?)</p>
<p>However, if your music starts to attract solid listen numbers, then the chances of them searching for more info online goes up significantly.</p>
<p>Make sure they have more than your SC to find. Something, as said, where you can put out news and updates - and directly communicate with them.</p>

<p>I’m sure you are spot on about climbing the ladder and the importance of playlists. It’s just not very transparent to me what they are doing or how they are doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ckHyEMEcaMM">Jon Sine did a decent overview of how it functions recently.</a> Worth checking out.</p>
<p>Plus, there are <a href="https://blog.landr.com/?s=playlist">some articles on the subject of playlists over in the Landr blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…make it big. But if that’s not your goal…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in that case, <em>imo</em>, being on a Spotify at all is just about vanity and the feel-good factor / bragging rights.</p>

            <p>I really only put tracks on Spotify etc. because I either think they are higher quality than my other music or because I wanted to do something special at that time. I feel that Auxy is just the first in many steps for me as a producer and I want to branch out and eventually get other software and combine it for music production.</p>

            <p>No! I set release dates so that I know when my music is going live. If I don’t set one, my music sometimes never sees the light of iTunes, and I never know why. It’s annoying.</p>

            <p>I love Spotify. I’ve put my music on it (via good ol’ <a href="http://amuse.io">amuse.io</a>), and it’s been a fairly good experience.</p>
<p>The thing I don’t like is how long it takes to get “verified.” I’ve been waiting for it for about 4 months now. It would probably be faster if I put in a twitter account, but I don’t want to invest time in that. If I didn’t use it much, Spotify would likely think it’s fake.</p>
