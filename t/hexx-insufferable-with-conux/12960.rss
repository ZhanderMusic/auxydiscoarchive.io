    <title>Hexx - Insufferable (With Conux)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/hexx-insufferable-with-conux/12960</link>
    <description>So Conux, who you may remember from Kleuren, just released an EP.  (i.e. https://soundcloud.com/conux_official/sets/human-nature ) Now, I had sung a song in it, but it may have been overshadowed by the first song. It having like 382 listens as of now, and mine having like 10. So, here’s the link to the song I sung in. https://soundcloud.com/conux_official/insufferable-ft-hexx</description>

            <p>I think that’s because the first song was released like 3 months earlier</p>
