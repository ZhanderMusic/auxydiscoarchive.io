            <p>Don’t get me wrong, I love the pack, but I feel we’ve had several retro synths packs recently. I would like some more diversity. Nice sounds, though. Really nice. I would just like some diversity.</p>

            <p>Anyway back to the specific subject, I actually really like this pack, I also think that the sounds a are more diverse than what they seem so don’t limit your use of then just us to because they he demo sounds synthwave</p>

            <p>I still disagree that’s they were specifically styled stranger things, although that would be for  <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> or <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fredrik">@Fredrik</a>  to tell you.</p>
<p>They were styled for retro music and happen to be good for recreation of a popular retro theme however they are not specifically For said theme.</p>

<li>No I understood what you meant, I just disagreed and think that the music makes the show, in fact listening to the soundtrack is what prompted me to watch the show.</li>
<li>I never said that all the retro sound packs sound like stranger things but with a combination of sounds from here and there you can totally shape the stranger things soundtrack in auxy.</li>
<li>To tell you the truth these days you can never exactly mark the genre of a song. The diversity of music combining together is amazing. BTW good luck with your book!<br>
P.S. I love debating. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">

            <p>First of all you got my message backward. I said without the show the music wouldn’t be as popular and secondly my main thing is of course you <em>can</em> recreate stranger things music with the packs released but that ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT make them specifically “Stranger Things packs”, it make some them retro inspired packs. All I wanna do is diversify people’s perspectives on synthwave. Not all synthwave sounds like stranger things and stranger things music is not the first nor will it be the last or even the best synthwave music.</p>
<p>The point is they’re not stranger things packs, simply because the genre is more diverse than one piece of pop culture.</p>
