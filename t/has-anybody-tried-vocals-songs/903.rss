    <title>Has Anybody Tried Vocals Songs?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/has-anybody-tried-vocals-songs/903</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I was just curious if anyone else has tried putting vocals in their songs? I know Phil and Ivo made a pretty sweet one, and I was wondering if anyone else has tried making an Auxy vocal track. Anyway, I just made one ( https://soundcloud.com/user-andrewadams/this-moment-now-6 ) and I would love to hear if anybody else has tried this.</description>

            <p>I think I’ve decided I’m not a good enough singer either.</p>
<p>But… I am a pretty good guitar player.</p>
<p>Electric guitar solos or rhythm additions anyone?</p>
<p>I’m working on a few right now. Not ready to share yet but stay tuned.</p>
