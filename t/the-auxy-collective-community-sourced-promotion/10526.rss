    <title>「 The Auxy Collective 」 - Community Sourced Promotion</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/the-auxy-collective-community-sourced-promotion/10526</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to premise the following with the fact that I and many others have come across a lot of very talented but under recognized Auxy producers. Often times they&#39;re just newer to the scene and have not been able to establish themselves as much, or they are simply not as good as promoting their tracks as others.

The goal of this project is to create a system that is fully controllable by every member of the community and that grants a centralized and organized manner to suggest and promote tracks from artists in our ever growing community. With that said...

***The Auxy Collective***

A community sourced collective for sharing and perpetuating music that is appreciated by the community, but not *necessarily* as well known.

**How does it work?**

The collective consists of an official collective discord community as well as a community run SoundCloud account. Anybody can suggest tracks and vote on them in dedicated channels, and with enough votes, the track will be reposted to the community SoundCloud for others to view.

**What is the point of this?**

As I&#39;m sure you all know, Auxy runs an official SoundCloud account where they repost select tracks from the Auxy community. This is an excellent way of sharing high quality music with the community, however the means that the Auxy team can become aware of high quality tracks are limited as the tracks are sourced by only a few people. This project aims to remove that limitation by using the same concept of a centralized and globally known collective for promoted music, but with the source for the music being the entire community. 

**How do I join?**

You can join our Discord server here (https://discord.gg/KWbvaSE).

You can also follow our SoundCloud account here (https://soundcloud.com/auxycollective).

--

Feel free to ask questions. The end goal is that together, we can increase visibility for some of those lesser known but still extremely talented artists. :slightly_smiling_face:</description>

            <p>Great point. Another goal of it was to create a community of producers that kind of bridges Auxy and mobile music producers with the “outside world” of music (i.e. other, bigger music communities) and I think that goal is being accomplished quite nicely.</p>

            <p>Just want to put out there that the Auxy Collective has been a really nice addition to the official Auxy repost account. The Auxy Collective’s objective was never to take the place of the Auxy SoundCloud, but to add a more democratic, fair system where (ideally) tracks are promoted based on quality, rather than the fame of the artist.</p>

            <p><strong>Updates for those not in the Discord:</strong></p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve posted an update here, mainly because at this point a lot of you that frequent the Discourse forum are also on part of our community. But, with several major updates this time around, it’s about time that we give another update! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We have our first official feedback stream scheduled this weekend on Saturday, 2 PM EST run by our man <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stereofield">@stereofield</a>. Make sure to stop by with your unreleased tracks and get some feedback from the community. Remember that you have to be in the voice chat at the time your track is called in order to have it played!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along with our feedback stream this Saturday, we have our Auxy Collective debut release premiering during the stream. A lot of talented artists contributed to it and we’re excited to be able to present it to you all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s time for some more audience expansion! We’re working with another network owner and have an expected growth of another 2-4 thousand followers. Final details coming soon… so stay tuned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve hit 200 members on The Auxy Collective discord. Growth in the community is just as important as growth in the SoundCloud audience!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There have been several server-related QOL changes. Nothing too major, but everything counts. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> We’ve also partnered with a couple other music servers (BONSAI, Juice Box, etc.) on the note of our server member milestone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a great week, and thanks for helping this become a success! There have been several other updates posted to our Discord that we haven’t posted here, so as always if you’re interested in being kept fully up to date, make sure to join our community server (a link can be found on the original post to this thread).</p>

            <p><strong>Updates for those not in the Discord:</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got several big updates this time around as The Auxy Collective continues to expand.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The wonderful “LUNCHBOX” label has joined our network and will be reposting the top 3 selected tracks from each week of The Auxy Collective voting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our discord has hit 100 members (that is, 100 participants of music curation, voting, music feedback, and fun discussion) and is growing fast. Thanks to everyone who supported this so early on and continues to do so! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/pray.png?v=5" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The label “Phuture Collective” will be assisting us with various tasks for our label including reposting highlighted tracks and promoting the collective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We do post the majority of the updates on our Discord, so make sure to join it to be kept fully up to date (the link is at the first post of this thread). As usual however, the major updates will be posted here as well. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>It seems that this system has a system that avoids direct blame, however; if I’m not wrong, this new project relies on the community’s voting, and so any one person or even group is spared the accusation of corruption. Community voting looks like a helpful new feature, but I could be misinformed as to if it’s been implented in the past.</p>

            <p><strong>Update for those not in the Discord:</strong></p>
<p>Round two of voting has concluded and the tracks will be reposted throughout the week. Below are some important notes that happened during the past week:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We have a finalized system for voting and reposting as well as a schedule. Voting concludes each Sunday and tracks are reposted throughout the week at 2-day intervals starting that Monday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Auxy Collective Discord now has a 24/7 bot to automate the leaderboard process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of our mission to broaden and expand the listening audience for those in the community, specifically The Auxy Collective, all tracks that are reposted will also be reposted to the labels “The Music Spotlight” and “EDM Central”. We are going to continue discussing with more labels agreements as far as repairing and distributing the pre vetted tracks from the collective, so the audience only grows from here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but definitely not least, there’s been so much amazing music suggested that I hadn’t even heard before. Really an amazing thing to see how much talent there is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, the majority of the updates do happen on the Discord, so if you’re interested you should join it to be kept up to date. However, I will post the most important updates to this thread. The tracks for this week will be reposted to our official SoundCloud account at the top of this post.</p>

<p>I don’t want to rain on what Arimyth is doing because I think it’s a great idea, and I hope it works out. This is the closest I’ve ever come to downloading the Discord app lol. I might just be pushed over yet!</p>

<p>The budget for new hires simply isn’t there.</p>
<p>It would require a new round of investment, which I think they’d have trouble attracting.</p>
<p>Due to how they’ve handled things so far, they’re now in a catch 22 situation.<br>
They need more signs of success to justify/attract new investment, but without the investment they’re going to struggle to achieve the signs of success required.</p>
<p>As great as it would be to increase the dev capabilities, new marketing leadership would probably be a necessary priority to increase/maximise revenue from the app in its current form (with its current dev capabilities).</p>
<p>You could throw bodies into the dev team, but so long as there’s no real marketing activity, they’re taking the hard route to every $ they make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’ve suggested reaching out for quality volunteers for certain social things, but I’m not sure the good will is there for members to step up and donate more of their free time, when Auxy (a commercial, <em>for–profit</em> company), isn’t very engaged with its own community. That’s entirely on them.</p>

            <p>I agree it’s not related <em>directly</em> to what Arimyth is doing, but tangentially it’s a direct result of it.</p>
<p>Future posts regarding dev teams involvement should be put in the raising the bar forum thread, I think it makes more sense there -&gt; <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/raising-the-bar-for-the-future-of-auxy/3035/236">Raising the bar for the future of Auxy</a>.</p>

            <p>Their infrequent presence here is only one aspect. Very little comes back when the community (repeatedly) suggests features (or promotes repost candidates - <em>as requested</em>). I appreciate the need for some level of discretion in confirming/denying plans for future features*, but it has always felt like requesting/suggesting features is a pointless exercise for members and a squandering of the community’s good will, energy and support by the app team. It may have been started with the right intentions, but you might as well put feature requests in a <em>’Dear Santa’</em> letter, for all the good it will do.</p>
<p>(Who here requested that they revise how bar length and offset is presented in the arrangement/scenes bar? I’m not aware of anyone ever citing it as a problem, let alone enough complaints to justify spending time revising it at the cost of implementing other, low-hanging, repeatedly requested, self-evidently useful new features - such as showing track duration.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I’d kinda expect them to share their enthusiasm and excitement about some of the features being requested.)</p>

<p>By engagement, I was referring to all (missed) opportunities to engage. Here, but also their largely forgotten Facebook, their largely forgotten Twitter, the under-utilised in-app feed, their under-utilised website (Medly actually promotes user music directly on the app website), …</p>
<p>The only generally positive example is the SC reposts - and that’s patchy and not without its issues.</p>
<p>For a digital company that’s supposedly oriented towards the future, they’re behaving in a very ‘Web 1.0’ kinda way.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s enough support or engagement from the app team to justify that kind of reciprocal support from the userbase/community.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Which could explain why at first the team was engaged more with the Disco as a whole, holding BTC challenges, tutorial videos to hopefully gain a presence on YouTube, flood SC with tons of entries, etc.</p>
<p>However, when Auxy 5 came out it was probably more clear than ever before that method wasn’t working, so it was minimized in importance perhaps? There’s been significantly less engagement since the few weeks after release, the only notable point of involvement being the huge storm and damage control that was the initial 5.1 update.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to put it in a negative light, but with each passing day of absolute silence, I can only start to assume the worst possible scenario.</p>
