    <title>With It - WAVZ [Hip Hop]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/with-it-wavz-hip-hop/15059</link>
    <description>Auxy finally hit me with that repost after a couple months of liking my tracks from time to time, and following me! üôèüèª This stands out to me because I think it‚Äôs good step in the direction of getting some of the hip hop producers out there into the spotlight of the Auxy community. I was here when Auxy JUST started and since then there‚Äôs a small amount of HipHop producers i have come into contact with in this forum but hopefully we can keep producing amazing content for everyone to enjoy! A small victory, but it does motivate me to know people still listen to my projects even if it‚Äôs been a slow month!
