    <title>Last Stars - Akyut Remix (Tribestep)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/last-stars-akyut-remix-tribestep/19286</link>
    <description>First off, I have no idea what genre this would be, so I&#39;m coining a new one that&#39;s most likely been done before B)

Second, this was an incredibly fun song to produce. There are a lot of new ideas here that I think are fresh, in the auxy-sphere and out. Let me know what you think!
