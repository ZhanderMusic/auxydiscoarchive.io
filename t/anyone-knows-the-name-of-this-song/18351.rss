    <title>Anyone knows the name of this song?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-knows-the-name-of-this-song/18351</link>
    <description>So for years ive heard this tune in a youtube video that got taken down recently and until now I still cant find the ID of this tune. Anyone knows if its from a video game? or the name of the song? Its driving me insane. I recreated the whole thing by memory, like 5 years ago memory but I want to find the original.
