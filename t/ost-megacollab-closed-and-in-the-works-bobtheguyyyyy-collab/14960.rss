            <p>im not trynna get on you for anything lol.  I know ur trying hard.</p>
<p>I was just making a general statement about the project overall.  I want to see this thing finished, but we just keep sitting on it.  So i figure a deadline would help, doesnt actually have to be the week i set it was just a random time.  But deadlines at least help me a lot with keeping things moving, especially with projects n stuff.  With something as big as this, i just think it’d help too.</p>

            <p>I’d say give it 1 more week and cap it there.  If ppl finish their projects, great, if not, it’s unfortunate but this project has been picked up and dropped so many times I’m amazed it hasn’t been lost yet</p>
