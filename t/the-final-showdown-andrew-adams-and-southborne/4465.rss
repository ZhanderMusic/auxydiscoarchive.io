            <p>Well I donâ€™t think we really thought about that. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"> I suppose if it really took off, Iâ€™d ask Southborne what he wanted to do, and weâ€™d figure something out together.</p>

            <p>Cool. Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Who â€˜ownsâ€™ the track at the end? All contributors equally?<br>
What would happen if the track took off and started generating income?</p>
<p>Or is it all very organic and informal and not something that was discussed or considered?</p>
<p>I know theyâ€™re boring, pragmatic questions, but Iâ€™m interested in your thoughts. Thanks. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hey there! Well every collab process isnâ€™t the same, but for this one I started out with the build and then thought Iâ€™d have Southborne help me with the drop (cause I knew heâ€™s super good with them). Then I added some stuff, and he added some stuff, and we were done! Took a few weeks.</p>
<p>I think collabs work the best when you both focus on your strengths. For example if you want somebody to add a cool piano part in your song then ask someone whoâ€™s good at piano, or if you have a good build but donâ€™t quite know how to make the drop sound right, ask somebody whoâ€™s good at drops.</p>
<p>And thanks for the reminderâ€”youâ€™re right, I should use those tags more. To be honest Iâ€™ve only been on Auxy since the spring and Iâ€™m still trying to learn all the genres and stuff. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

            <p>Collabs happen fairly regularly here, but no-one really seems to talk about the process. I think that would be really interesting to hear about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
How long did it take from start to finish?</p>
<p>Did it start with a blank slate, or did one of you have the idea that you then developed together?<br>
Or was there already a hook/theme or the core of a track, which was then developed by the other party?</p>
<p>Was it like remix tennis â€“ with versions bouncing back and forth? How many rounds of changes were there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Btw, you should always make sure to tag it with a music genre. Without any music genre tags, itâ€™s unlikely be included in SCâ€™s automated share/promotion algorithms (â€˜Related Tracksâ€™, â€˜The Uploadâ€™, â€˜Stationsâ€™). Using only <span class="hashtag">#auxy</span> might help promote it to others who use the <span class="hashtag">#auxy</span> tag, but ideally you want it reaching out as far as it can go.)</p>
