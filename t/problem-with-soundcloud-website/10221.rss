    <title>Problem with Soundcloud website?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/problem-with-soundcloud-website/10221</link>
    <description>For some strange reason, whenever I try to listen to my songs on the Soundcloud website it sounds awful, everyone else&#39;s tracks sound fine. 

Whenever I listen to my tracks on the Soundcloud apps, it sounds normal again...

Can anybody explain why?

hmmmmmmm</description>

            <p>It could happen for multiple reasons.<br>
It probably has to do with your mixing quality, since you say it only happens to your songs.</p>
<p>Your song probably sounds fine on your phone because the sound driver is the one you used to create the song. Your computer has a different (and likely worse) sound driver, which processes sound differently. It may cut out, or change some frequencies, making your song sound a little different.</p>
<p>You said your songs sound muffled? Usually the better the mix, the clearer the song sounds. Try balancing out the frequencies in the mix (i.e. highpass, lowpass, volume).</p>
<p>I not actually very experienced in mixing, so I can’t really tell you many specific things that may help. Maybe do some research?</p>
<p>Also, please note that this is just speculation, I’ve had this problem in the past with my songs, so I’m just telling you what worked for me.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>It’s like if you were to put it through an eq and bring all low frequencies down</p>
