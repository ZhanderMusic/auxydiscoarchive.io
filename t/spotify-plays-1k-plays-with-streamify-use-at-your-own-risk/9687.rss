            <p>yeah, that thought crossed my mind as well – thing is, they <em>guaranteed</em> it, and if they’re not able to be 100% sure about their service, but claim to be, that’s not super professional…</p>
<p>anyway, it’s not a big deal. i think everyone agrees that it’s a sketchy service and we shouldn’t use it.</p>

            <p>For the last point, I expect that they have had much experience with their promotion, and know that within 5 days (could be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), your track will most likely have 1,000 plays.</p>
<p>They could be bots too, but that point isn’t very convincing as well.</p>

            <p>The United States thing is a bit sketchy, but your other points were just forced. I can see how it would take a day for them to get into contact with all of their partners to promote your music.</p>
<p>Don’t want to defend the company too much because it can very well be not legit, but none of your points provide valid evidence that it is a scam.</p>
<p>Either way though, the service still is sketchy and I would stay away from it.</p>

<p>Since this is such a sketchy service, I see no reason to trust their FAQs, where they claim that all of their tracks are played by “music promoters, DJ’s, online radio stations”, etc.</p>
<p>In case you don’t know, this is “streaming fraud”, a.k.a. fake plays on Spotify that you earn money from. Again don’t do it bye</p>

<p>Sure enough, within a few days I noticed the song had been added to a fairly popular user generated playlist (of about 50,000 followers) that they must have</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
As suspected, it’s likely using some dodgy techniques that Spotify will punish the artist for.</p>
<p>So, this is a no-go for me. I won’t be touching it.<br>
My advice to others would be to use it at your own risk, knowing what <em>could</em> happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Time to look for legit playlist pluggers instead.</p>

<p>If those plays are all recorded as legit, then that represents an insanely good investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/01/16/streaming-music-services-pay-2018/">Spotify = ~$0.00397 per stream</a></p>
<p>2 million Spotify plays = ~$8000 pay-out. That’s a 250% profit.</p>
<p>Not to mention the additional unsponsored plays you’d get from the increased exposure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
It’s looking like a good route to establish an audience, which ideally becomes self-sustaining – but which you could always ‘top-up’ with an additional push with each release.</p>

<p>Like I said, I’d be worried that Spotify might identify it as gaming the system and either render it useless somehow or penalise the artist account.</p>
<p>Like how Google is increasingly good at identifying paid link promotion and will actually penalise the beneficiary by pushing them down the rankings.</p>
<p>This one’s probably ok, but not all exposure is good. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>yeah, i’m worried about that too. But the the website looks legit.</p>
<p>and the distribution happens only in US (their partner list)</p>

anyway, i think a good option as a startup to promote for the first timer… if it’s indeed working as they said well… a good option.</p>
<p>$2,250 for 2million plays danggg</p>

            <p>I’m torn on this, in principle.</p>
<p>It’s says no bots, but depending on how the plays are acquired, I’d worry if it’s identifiable by Spotify as somehow ‘gaming’ the system and likely to result in the artist account being penalised.</p>
<p>If they’re acquired simply through paid-for playlist promotion – which is standard practice these days – and the plays happen organically that way, I’d be more up for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[Edit…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://streamify.me/faq.html"><strong>How are you distributing plays?</strong></a></p>
<p>Spotify track plays are sent to our huge partner list that includes music promoters, DJ’s, online radio stations, playslists and various other parties. We provide them only the Spotify URI of the tracks you give us. We do not provide partners with any information about who has requested those plays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a promotion network. If it’s legit, they would be real plays and should be fine, and as mentioned, pretty much the standard pay-to-play playlist promotion model commonly used by artists and labels of all sizes these days.</p>
<p>I’m going to do more reading on the site and may well give it a spin, maybe even try one of the larger bundles, if the 1000 free plays offer works out.</p>
<p>Every release should have a marketing budget.</p>
