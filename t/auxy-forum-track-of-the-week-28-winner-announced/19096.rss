    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**

&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt; * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt; * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**

&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 

ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  

&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**

One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. The judges alternate between: - 

* iammane
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @AzureOnyx 

**‚ìürize**

* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Week 28 has come to a close!</p>
<p>There were some submissions where I couldn‚Äôt chose between them. Here are those results:</p>
<p>The first submission where I feel like it should win is <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/kam">@Kam</a>‚Äôs submission, ‚ÄúLike This‚Äù<br>
Dude, this is honestly a relaxing track and I love every bit of it, extend it to a 3-4 minute song. As soon as the low pitched piano came on, I immediately loved it, the vocals add to the aesthetic of the overall track. Amazing job!</p>
<p>The second submission where I feel like should also win is <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/deru">@Deru</a>‚Äôs submission, ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äù<br>
This track rumbles with sub bass with melodies, plus, it doesn‚Äôt have that generic EDM buildup where I grew to absolutely hate. Likewise with Kam‚Äôs submission, the vocals add to the track, and when the track slows down in the middle of the track and onto the horns really gives it an urban vibe to it, especially now when the world needs it at most, cough.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs another submission that really caught my ears, and that‚Äôs <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/octave">@Octave</a>‚Äôs submission, ‚ÄúSuperstitious‚Äù<br>
A much lighter tone/feeling throughout the week when compared to other submissions. I honestly don‚Äôt mind the anime aesthetic. One thing that kinda falls apart is that the song barely changes, which isn‚Äôt that bad since I too have that same problem <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Great submission nonetheless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Choosing between the 3 submissions isn‚Äôt easy, but there could only be one winner.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/kam">@Kam</a> for winning this weeks Auxy Track of the Week!</strong></p>
<p>As for your reward, you earn the special silver disc as part of your name! Welcome to the club!</p>
