            <p>Thanks for the feedback, this song is about a war, the section at 1:30 is suppose to sound like a war, the drums are supposed to resemble swords clashing together and other weapon sounds, it’s also supposed to sound like it’s raining in the background. They lose that 1st war but in the end, they recover and are always prepared for any future wars.</p>

            <p>Interesting track! It played out like a story, and I could feel what you were trying to convey in your song. The drums, as banging as they were, sounded muddy in the break at 1:30 and near the end. Maybe instead of making the drums super complicated, try turning the sound or low pass up using the automations and/or changing the chords up.</p>
