    <title>Hard Light - Meridian [Single]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/hard-light-meridian-single/19290</link>
    <description>New single for my non-experimental music. This is going to be on my upcoming EP, &quot;Midway.&quot; In my opinion, it&#39;s my best non-experimental work to date. I&#39;m not exactly sure what genre this is, so if anybody has any idea please reply with one. This is probably the most dynamic track on the EP and the one I am most proud of.

Constructive criticism is always welcome, hope you guys enjoy this. EP is likely coming next week.</description>

            <p>Track slaps.</p>
<p>Really great blend of genres all wrapped up in a funky/groovy package.</p>
<p>only complaint is i have is with that middle section.  It’s not bad, far from it, but idk just felt like it dragged for me.  I think it’s because it comes in with just a kick and kinda dampens the very energetic vibe from before.  Maybe if you just started it where the snare comes in it would have kept the energy up, but still allow you to have the breakdown.  Just my opinion on it tho.  Still a very solid track.</p>
