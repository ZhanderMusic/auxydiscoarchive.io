    <description>Technical comments are welcome, but I&#39;m more interested in visceral reactions.  

I have been creating tracks with Auxy but not exposing them to this post lately. Decided to do it again anyway. More coming soon. Each track varies to some degree from beginning to the end, so if you listen to one please stick with it till the end. Thanks!
