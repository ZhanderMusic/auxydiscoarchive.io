    <title>Goxenar x Austin Haga - Lightning Round (Zeph Remix)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/goxenar-x-austin-haga-lightning-round-zeph-remix/14531</link>
    <description>[Listen here](https://soundcloud.com/zephsound/goxenar-x-austin-haga)

I have been working on it for almost a year! It’s pretty crazy how far the track has come as I have been learning and teaching myself some handy things. It’s almost a completely different song than from when I worked on it the very first week. I am happy to finally be able to release a full blown track in almost 6 months of absence. I hope you guys that are a fan of dubstep, trap, riddim, etc. enjoy this track. I drew a lot of inspiration from Virtual Riot and Rickyxsan, they’ve been killing it lately.
