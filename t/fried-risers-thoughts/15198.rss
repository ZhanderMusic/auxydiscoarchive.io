            <p>Obviously itâ€™d be with permission to use it as a soundpcak for another program. Thatâ€™s next level, but if it were to use it for urself u wouldnâ€™t need permission coz that the whole purpose of it being there, for people to use. But in this instance obviously lenberg would need permission to have a secondary use</p>

            <p>You still cannot legally do this. If he did, he <strong><em>could and would</em></strong> be sued by both Splice <strong><em>and</em></strong> BlackOctopus. Do you understand what the terms and conditions are for Splice? They do not permit this. You do not have permission to distribute Splice samples for <em>any</em> reason. <strong><em>ESPECIALLY MONETARY GAIN</em></strong>. &gt;~&gt;</p>

            <p>â€¦</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know how to explain the fact that youâ€™re wrong, but you are in fact wrong. Iâ€™m going to try at the very leastâ€¦</p>
<p>A <em>subscription</em> (edited for clarification) to Splice would <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> permit the <strong><em>RESALE</em></strong> of sample packs. Auxyâ€™s subscription counts as a resale in legal terms. He would need a <em><strong>LICENSE</strong></em> for it. You donâ€™t <em><strong>BUY</strong></em> licenses from a subscription service like Splice. You either buy it from a middleman or directly from the company. This goes for many areas of business, and itâ€™s why places like Costco exist, and websites like CDW exist. They buy items in bulk then sell to end users at a reduced price, but still make a profit since they buy in bulk directly from manufacturers. But I digress, Iâ€™ve gotten off the point.</p>
<p>Since Lenberg would need a <strong><em>LICENSE</em></strong> to have ANY of the packs from places like BlackOctopus and Origin Sound, he gets them from the source (At least I can assume he does. I donâ€™t know of any third party music sampling bulk buyer out there).</p>
<p>I hope this makes senseâ€¦ if it doesnâ€™t I donâ€™t know how else I can help you aside from asking <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> himself to describe the process for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They buy packs from splice</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh joy time to play the pronoun game! Thereâ€™s two interpretations, either Lenberg buys packs or Black Octopus buys packs. Iâ€™ve attached interpretations for both.</p>
<p>Lenberg buys them from Splice? No. I think youâ€™re misinformed. They are <em>licensed</em> from Black Octopus <strong>directly</strong>. Just like Splice <em>licensed</em> them from Black Octopus <strong>as well</strong>.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re saying Black Octopus bought them from Splice and sold them to Auxyâ€¦ well I donâ€™t really know how I can help explain this to you, but no. Thatâ€™s not whatâ€™s happening at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I realize I forgot to say my thoughts on this pack, I can certainly say theyâ€™re a lot more useful than I first imagined, and am using them a fair bit.</p>

            <p>Names aside.  Iâ€™m wondering why these couldnâ€™t have been released on the melodic side in the same fashion as the sweepers pack.  Iâ€™m really wanting the ability to easily adjust the start and end and fades, etc on these but having a hard time.  Thoughts?</p>

            <p>As I recall, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> stated that he was willing to change any potentially offensive names so I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any question about maintaining consistency. I was just pointing out a personal observation that many of the pre-teens I see in the communities Iâ€™m in use much more profane language than I do. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Thatâ€™s besides the point and not all pre teens swear even if exposed, the app has 12+ rating language in it but is still marked 4+. It shows that the app is unreliable.</p>

            <p>If you think 12 year old below kids should be exposed to that stuff on an app that has no reason at all to have language of that sort, I donâ€™t know what to tell you. The truth is itâ€™s completely unnecessary and taking it off isnâ€™t a big problem which affects the main reason of the app. It shouldnâ€™t be up to auxy what kids should be exposed to but the parents.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™d argue the precedent where the previous instant was changed, consistency should be used in regards to this. But yeah, try telling any pre-teen or teenager not to swear and actually expect that to have any impact.</p>
