    <title>Dusk tears - early morning mist (toveii remix) • [ambient]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dusk-tears-early-morning-mist-toveii-remix-ambient/18462</link>
    <description>My first remix post! My original plan was to make it lofi hiphop, and I didn’t it like as much. So, after couple of months, I got back into it. I gotta say though, the feeling of finishing and releasing a track is the best thing ever lol. Anyways, hope you all enjoy! Any feedback is appreciated!
