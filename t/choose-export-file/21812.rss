    <description>I feel like it would be extremely convenient if you could choose what type of audio file you want to export your track as.

Before exporting, it could show a menu prompting you to choose between M4A, MP3, WAV, etc.

It would save me a trip to the M4A to MP3 converter and would also give everyone other options for exporting their tracks.</description>

            <p>If you export audio, it saves it in Apple’s native compressed aac format. Having an mp3 option would require us to get a license for each copy of the app, which isn’t feasible given the low interest in the format these days. So for mp3 specifically, you have to rely on external converters, and for that I recommend exporting wav files that you then compress.</p>
