    <title>Export a drum rack to Ableton?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/export-a-drum-rack-to-ableton/15138</link>
    <description>Thanks for adding ableton export, it’s great!

Is it possible to export the drum/samples as racks themselves into Ableton (Each sample having independent parameters such as volumes, etc)?</description>
