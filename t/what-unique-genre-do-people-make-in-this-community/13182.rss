    <title>What unique genre do people make in this community?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-unique-genre-do-people-make-in-this-community/13182</link>
    <description>I know I created a relevant post like this somewhere and somewhen, but I guess remake it, why not?

When I mean ‘Unique Genre’, I mean a Genre that’s not House, Future Bass, or Synthwave. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think Future House, Techno, and Progressive House are the type of House Music that aren’t unique (No Offense, that’s what I hear the most in this community ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

I’ll go first. The unique genre I make is Drum and Bass.

You can include your songs that you didn’t made in Auxy. Also putting a link in isn’t required, but it’s optional.</description>

            <p>Love this. I assume the distortions are added in Garageband, after Auxy? Or do you sample Garageband and then import into Auxy?</p>

            <p>Whatever I make? Experiments in power electronics and death industrial. I admit these genres are more suited to analog synths and no input noise more than Auxy’s digital interface, but I do what I can with it.
