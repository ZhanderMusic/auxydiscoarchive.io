    <title>So, what are the current strengths and weaknesses of you when making music?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/so-what-are-the-current-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-you-when-making-music/18404</link>
    <description>After a period of getting acquainted with Auxy and making music ( 1 year ),  I had a few things to draw about myself
 @Strongpoints:
 - Stable drum selection
 - Have good melody
 - Know a little bit of music, 
 - Good at vocal chop .
@Weaknesses: 
 - Transitions are not really good
- The build up is not yet outstanding
- The sound is sometimes monotonous  
- And not yet know more sample sound in Auxy


  **I hope that I can promote my strengths and overcome weaknesses in this year 2020**
 
- ***AND YOU ? What are the current strengths and weaknesses of you when  making music ?***</description>
