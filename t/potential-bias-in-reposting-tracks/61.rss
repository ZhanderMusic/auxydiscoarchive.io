    <title>Potential Bias in Reposting Tracks?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/potential-bias-in-reposting-tracks/61</link>
    <description>Heya!

First off, before I say anything, I just want everybody who sees this to know that I don&#39;t mean this post in any negative way. I am merely trying to clarify something that has been on my mind for a while! :smiley:

As you all know, Auxy reposts select tracks onto their SoundCloud page (https://soundcloud.com/auxy). Something I&#39;ve noticed, however, is that they tend to repost tracks by a few people (such as IVO, Hip Drop, DeCruz, etc.) more than other people (seemingly regardless of the quality of the track).

Again, I&#39;m not saying IVO/etc. make bad music, I am just wondering if any of you have noticed this? Could Henrik or one of the people who run the reposts clarify this? Thanks :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</description>

            <p>Genre/genre labelling is about relevance.</p>
<p>Of course, genre is certainly secondary to the music itself*, but accurate and useful genre labelling is important for helping others find the music they want to hear.</p>
<p>That includes automated recommendation engines, such as those used by SC, Spotify, etc…<br>
It allows them to recommend your stuff to the most welcoming and appreciative listeners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* Unless you’re making music aimed at a certain genre.</p>

<p>These are all the songs that got reposted from at least 5 days ago that aren’t future bass/EDM. Only 5(one or two are debatable) were future bass/EDM that got reposted.</p>
<p>That’s a 9/5 ratio.</p>
<p>I think we can do plenty with our current soundpacks. Yes, more is better, but if you want a different genre, actually try and make it, and it usually comes out ok.</p>
<p>I’m 110% sure that if you got really, really good at producing a different genre such as deep house(take RrammaH for example: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-928270225">https://soundcloud.com/user-928270225</a>) that you’ll be right up there with all the other cool famous people on the forum.</p>
<p>So please, if you think there needs to be more genre diversity, <em>be</em> that genre diversity. I don’t think that we need new sounds to produce new genres, when people are already doing it. So be innovative. Make your music different, and make it good. Then you’ll get that repost. Trust me. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I am sorry if my post came off as prideful. I wasn’t trying to seem that way. I have edited the post.</p>

            <p>One quick last point to quickly reiterate…</p>
<p>There has never been any intention to <em>argue</em> or <em>antagonise</em> in my thinking. No malice or heat, at all.<br>
Just a vigorous exchange of ideas and opinions.</p>

            <p>I feel like this argument - and yes, it has become this instead of a proper discussion - has been blown completely out of proportion. I think, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a>, your point(s) have been made evidently clear. Frankly, your original comments have been milked dry.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t think your concerns have been discounted. Trust me. You, obviously, have been the most vocal in this particular thread. However, I think you’ve exhausted your argument.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, the developers have prioritized aspects of their mission for their app. As useful and important their reposts on their Soundcloud account are to the community, it alone will not progress the popularity and/or exposure of the app. In truth, it <em>is</em> a fun feature that comes along with being part of the community. What genres and artists the account showcases is really <strong>not</strong> that vital to how users (new and old alike) view Auxy as a company. From a consumer perspective, I have been able to create many tracks that divert from what many see as “the popular genre”. (I. don’t. make. future. bass.) But I like to think my popularity in this community is attributed to my general sound quality. Just sayin’.</p>
<p>And as nice as it is to see diversity in releases and shares within the community, what the developers see as high quality tracks (no matter the genre or the artist), especially because they alone know the precise limits of the app they’ve created, is, in my opinion, best judged by them. It’s really not a big deal. The fact that they - two people - take the time to sift through so many songs created by such loyal users is special and to be congratulated in itself.</p>
<p>I know your criticisms are in the best interest of their company (at least you’ve pointed out many times that that is your intention), but you seem to constantly cast a very negative view over how Henrik and Fredrik are running their company. Their successes far outweigh the problems. And problems can be fixed. No need to demand so much from an already overworked duo.</p>
<p>I ask that we let our thoughts settle and just take a breather, despite how heated this thread might be. Cool down. And smile. Let the sunshine through. And let’s all make more awesome music. 'Kay?</p>

            <p>Fine counterpoints, if a little irritating to have ‘quotes’ ‘all’ ‘the’ time’ like an essay.</p>
<p>I’ve said my piece in what looks to be a very long discussion, but I think Auxy’s team is on the right track, and they should be focussed on continuing to provide good software – a tool that can be used by a beginner, but made into a masterpiece by an artist. By joe, maybe it will be future bass.</p>
<p>Alls I’m saying is it’s not Auxy’s problem to promote users. You make your own work when it comes to creative industries – and that includes marketing and promotion. Trrrust me!</p>
<p>Anyways, it’s 12am where I am so better get shut eye. But yo, if you’re gonna quote me, you better leave in the stuff where I’m channeling Snoop Dog.</p>

<p>letting me explain that (or at least refer to things I’ve written). I think people get confused about what Auxy actually thinks, and I don’t want to be forced to go in and correct things over and over. You’ve already made your points and I’ve addressed them. So why not leave it at that?</p>

</aside>
<p>If I am going over old ground and I’ve missed a specific point you’ve made that addresses any specific point I’ve made, then I apologise for creating noise, not signal.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think that’s the case (even including something like the issue of the ‘orientation’ of the app).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never made any points about not using reposted tracks to show off the app, have I?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All reposts are presumably done to show off the app. That’s without question.<br>
The question was, and to some extent remains, whether it was actively used to show off the app in the broadest way possible. (Something that would, presumably, benefit users, app and owners alike.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example was the above post from <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sunny">@Sunny</a>, who shared some personal opinions, which was met with things like…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did feel that the use of the word ‘silly’ was unfortunate to begin with, but I was trying to present an alternative perspective using the language Sunny had established.</p>
<p>I don’t think there was anything in my response that was actually incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we’re only 2 people running the company, and listening to all tracks made by the community is not feasible because that would completely halt any other development of the app, so therefore you shouldn’t take the reposting too seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Possible solutions that might help have been put forward here, but afaik, you’ve never commented as to their feasibility.</p>
<p>Specifically, the idea of enlisting the help of a volunteer or two, active in this community, who can be trusted and briefed as to the aims and expectations for reposts on the Auxy SC channel. (Much like you have re: mods, but to a greater extent.)</p>
<p>The additional hands would allow for more reviews (and more perspectives/spread, never a bad thing), and probably allow you to focus even more time on the app.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think it’s a problem when you drop these long and highly articulate, often thought through, replies on people who “just wanted to share their thoughts” <em>and</em> tell your story about how we (Auxy) think about things instead of letting me explain that (or at least refer to things I’ve written). I think people get confused about what Auxy actually thinks, and I don’t want to be forced to go in and correct things over and over. You’ve already made your points and I’ve addressed them. So why not leave it at that?</p>
<p>An example was the above post from <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sunny">@Sunny</a>, who shared some personal opinions, which was met with things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it would ‘silly’ if Auxy weren’t actively using their SC channel to cast the best - and broadest - net. To maximise appeal (at least, in terms of genre relevance). But, that’s exactly what appears to have been happening, supported by statements Auxy devs have made that point to them not utilising it as a formal marketing channel (supporting marketing objectives), but a more personal, fun side-thing for Lenberg and Fredrik.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have never made any points about not using reposted tracks to show off the app, have I? And perhaps I wasn’t clear enough, but the point I was making is that we’re only 2 people running the company, and listening to all tracks made by the community is not feasible because that would completely halt any other development of the app, so therefore you shouldn’t take the reposting too seriously. From the feedback in threads like this, I’ve learnt that it’s important for people though, which is something I’ll take into account when planning and prioritizing for the future.</p>
