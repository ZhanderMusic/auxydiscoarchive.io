            <p>Hereâ€™s my thoughts:<br>
Try and make transitions smoother. Ex. When you add in new instruments between scenes,maybe you could try and make them kind of phase in at the end of the previous scene. Also near the end of the buildup and during the drop, there was no volume contrast. The hour sounded like the same settings it was on when it was first introduced. I would definitely try and change that in your future projects. Otherwise song up has some good ideas and guts the name pretty well</p>
