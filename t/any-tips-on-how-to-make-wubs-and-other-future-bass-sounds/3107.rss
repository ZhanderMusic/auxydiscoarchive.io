    <title>Any Tips on How to Make Wubs (and other future bass sounds)?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/any-tips-on-how-to-make-wubs-and-other-future-bass-sounds/3107</link>
    <description>My new track, Believe, has a lot of wubs in it. I made the wubs by listening to Produk and aUstin Haga and trying to mimic those styles, but idk if I’m accurate. Does anyone know exactly how to make wubs, or other future bass sounds?

Here’s the link to my track: https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/believe

Am I doing it right or wrong? xP

Leave a tip below if you know ;)</description>

            <p>(Subject to opinion) <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/produk">@Produk</a> <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/thecreepermatik">@TheCreeperMatik</a><br>
Otter is pretty good for future bass Layers — if you use it in the right context. You would want to use otter when paired with another “wubby” (is that even a word?) instrument, like silk or fragment.</p>
<p>Another point that has nothing to do with otter:<br>
When you pair “wubby” (I guess I’m using it as a word) Instruments together, you can achieve amazing results, like Changes by <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/austin_haga">@aUstin_Haga</a>. (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/austin_haga/changes">https://soundcloud.com/austin_haga/changes</a>)<br>
The Song implements Hour, Silk, and Fragment as the main chord leads.</p>

            <p>Just automate low pass continuously to get an effect like Austin or Phil or anechoik.</p>
<p>Good sounds to use are:<br>
Silk<br>
Hour<br>
Fragment<br>
Otter<br>
Jelly<br>
Joker</p>

            <p>I think that you were pretty much accurate on how to mimic the future bass wub sound, most of the time though, the sounds have to be even to create it. I have some examples in this project, which have a wub-like sound using the volume mixer and the low pass mixer. However, also note that I’m still a sort of new person towards Auxy, so I’m giving you information that I’ve learnt myself and from my own experiences.</p>

<p>Good sounds to use are: (In my opinion)<br>
Silk (Seven skies selection)<br>
Fragment (Sound of Vivrant)<br>
Silo (RAC Essentials)<br>
Otter (Original)</p>
