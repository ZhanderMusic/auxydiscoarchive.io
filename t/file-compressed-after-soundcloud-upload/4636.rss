    <title>File compressed after Soundcloud upload?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/file-compressed-after-soundcloud-upload/4636</link>
    <description>So I made a song pretty recently, and for some reason when I uploaded it to SoundCloud it went from sounding like one of my best tracks so far to sounding like an old grandpa’s fart ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
(The track is called Fall btw)

So here’s the original:
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgE8leg-SEl8iV1hd_KSJoX3J-jU

And then here’s what it sounded like when I uploaded it to SoundCloud:
https://soundcloud.com/prysmedm/fall

So yeah, that happened, anybody else experienced this? Any ideas on why it compressed when I uploaded it?</description>

            <p>It’s sound like your bass instrument is distorting. It’s true that SC converts(transcode) tracks to mp3 for streaming, but it shouldn’t be distorting. Have you’ve tried re-uploading the track(privately, just to check if the same issue occurs)?</p>

            <p>If I remember correctly, SoundCloud does a level adjustment before the encoding to prevent errors caused by 0 dB peaks.</p>

<p>It works pretty well when exporting lossless WAVs, but can often sound pretty poor when converted to mp3.</p>

            <p>Ah, thanks for the info. That track was my first ever attempt at manual mastering my track so I didn’t know about that.</p>

            <p>There are some good tips <a href="https://www.justmastering.com/article-mixingformp3.php">here</a> on improving sound quality of lossy conversions.</p>
<p>As a starting point, I’d pull back the levels on your mix.</p>
<p>Auxy puts a limiter on your final mix to try and match a mastered track’s volume.<br>
It works pretty well when exporting lossless WAVs, but can often sound pretty poor when converted to mp3.</p>
<p>Perhaps consider doing two mixes. One for sale, promo, DJing etc… and one for uploading to social media channels.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it’s got to get the file small enough to stream, there have to be compromises to make that happen. In this case you have a very wide frequency range which highlights the limitations of the format.</p>
