    <title>Serato Studio. Free/Freemium Mac/Win desktop DAW – quite Auxy-like</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/serato-studio-free-freemium-mac-win-desktop-daw-quite-auxy-like/19814</link>
    <description>Just stumbled on Serato Studio.

Could be a good experience for those who spun up their interest in music production using Auxy, and would like to use a desktop DAW, but don&#39;t have the funds to go with one of the usual options.

UI/UI seems like good middle-ground between Auxy and the more established desktop DAWs.

It&#39;s a similar model to Auxy too. Free with a selection of sound packs and loops or monthly Subscription with new sound packs / loops added every month.

Obvs, works with midi controllers, keyboards, etc…
Also works &quot;seamlessly&quot; with Serato&#39;s other DJ hardward, etc…
Supports VSTs and AU plugins.

            <p>1 audio track does seem particularly light. Though, I’m assuming one-hits can be triggered using the MIDI channels. So, 1 audio track more than Auxy gives you — possibly all you need if you just want to lay down a simple vocal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Never been a fan of that Ampify/Launchpad 3rd-party loop-triggering approach.<br>
Doesn’t feel like real music making to me. More like a cool music toy.</p>
<p>Any producer that has that approach at the heart of their creative process deserves some major <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/unamused.png?v=9" title=":unamused:" class="emoji" alt=":unamused:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_raised_eyebrow.png?v=9" title=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_raised_eyebrow:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I’ll take a look at the Roland ZenBeats option though. Seems cross-device, which is something I’m looking at as I move away from Auxy.</p>
<p>I’ve got Ableton 10, but I’m open to different workflows if the flexibility is there.</p>

            <p>Good share.<br>
I had no idea this existed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://serato.com/studio/pricing">free version has a few limitations</a>, but it looks like quite a decent little mashup maker.</p>
<p>A few alternatives worth considering:</p>
