    <title>What new Genre’s could we come up with?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-new-genre-s-could-we-come-up-with/9824</link>
    <description>Hello guys, tropical here. So ive been hearing a lot of awesome songs from everyone but feels the same to me. We should come up with some new genres, the most I’ve been hearing is Edm, Trap, Techno, and Hard Bass. I’m not complaining but would like your opinion on some new genres we could make. Im currently trying ambient, like without drums and smooth melodies. What do you guys think?</description>
