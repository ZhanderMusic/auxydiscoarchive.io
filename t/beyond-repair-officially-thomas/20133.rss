Beyond Repair is now out on all platforms! 

It is the 1st single from my upcoming project! The album has a storyline: 

This song is where I confront a girlfriend AFTER my friend caught her cheating on me. She admits it and now I am enraged and deeply heartbroken. There’s a key change in the song where I consider forgiving her but I decide “oh forget this, I’m not forgiving her!”</description>
