    <title>:mermaid: Siren Ep - OffCmd [ dark electro house ]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/siren-ep-offcmd-dark-electro-house/12938</link>
    <description>During the third Auxy tournament challenges I came up with [a few ideas](https://soundcloud.com/offender/high) that then got further developed into full tracks, and today they&#39;ve materialized into this 4 track EP:
[https://offcmd.bandcamp.com/album/siren-ep](https://offcmd.bandcamp.com/album/siren-ep)

Very intense, deep and layered melodies. All Auxy except for the vocals on &quot;So High&quot; by Carol Borges.
Thanks for your continued support! @DHO, @NotMiles, @paxman, @Sunny
