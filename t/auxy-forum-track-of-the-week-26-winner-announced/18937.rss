    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-26-winner-announced/18937</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

Welcome to the FIRST Auxy TotW throw down. First, I want to announce a small revamp of the system. If you checked out the TotW hall of fame, you may have already noticed the updated verbiage. 

For each five :cd:&#39;s you earn, you are certified gold :dvd:

For each five :dvd:&#39;s you earn, you are certified platinum :minidisc:

Big congratulations to our FIRST gold certified member @simon2! His profile has already been updated. So without any further blibber blabber, read on for the rules.  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* iammane
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @iammane 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/asis_4591">@Asis_4591</a>- this was tough, you guys posted some great work, Asis did a great job because my attention was grabbed immediately, the little nuances and slap bass sold me. I don‚Äôt normally dig future bass but you packaged it up in a way that a non-fan could still appreciate it. Also, your artwork is super cool. I don‚Äôt know where you got it from, or if you made it, but very nice to look at.</p>
<p>Great job everyone! Head on over to the next TotW and let‚Äôs keep the ball rolling.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶are you allowed to submit short songs, like only a build and drop? Just wondering because I might just try to make a quick song every 2 days</p>

</aside>
<p>That should probably be entered in the Build &amp; Drop of the Week thread. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smirk.png?v=9" title=":smirk:" class="emoji" alt=":smirk:"></p>
<p>In all seriousness, judging can sometimes take several hours, so I‚Äôd rather be listening to people‚Äôs best work, not something they threw together just for the sake of entering‚Ä¶</p>
<p>That said, I have no issue with short <strong>tracks</strong>, provided they don‚Äôt break rule <span class="hashtag">#3</span>.</p>

            <p>The song is originally made by me, and I created it for someone else‚Äôs submission for a game competition that they haven‚Äôt won. The game has not been shown to the public, and the tracks I used for that game are not posted or publicized either. Could I use the song in this case or does it still mean I should make a different submission?</p>
