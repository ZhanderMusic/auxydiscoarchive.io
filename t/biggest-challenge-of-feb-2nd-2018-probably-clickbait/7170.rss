    <title>Biggest Challenge Of Feb 2nd 2018 (probably clickbait)!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/biggest-challenge-of-feb-2nd-2018-probably-clickbait/7170</link>
    <description>Recently, the auxy community has changed...

Nevermind that now--A fun challenge instead!

I&#39;ve been into recreating songs in auxy. I failed miserably, so I&#39;ll pass that challenge on to you.

This song: https://soundcloud.com/essential_music/teminite-panda-eyes-high-score-edmcom-exclusive is not only one of my favorite dubstep-y EDM-y songs, but it seems like a nice challenge for you [spoiler]5-bucks-a-month[/spoiler] people.

Feel free to use any drum kits you like as long as it isn&#39;t charge or whack or north or frame or dollar or mold or dust or craft.</description>
