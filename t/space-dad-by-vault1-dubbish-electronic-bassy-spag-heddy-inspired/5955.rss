    <title>Space Dad - by VAULT1 [Dubbish, Electronic, Bassy] (Spag Heddy Inspired)</title>

    <description>This is my first time using the Auxy forum, so hey wassup.
I like to naturally take things at ease so that&#39;s why my titles and pictures are not really serious all the time.
But besides that, I really like taking the actual creation of music seriously, so you should take a look and see how bad I am at being seriousüëç
(That may or may not be me desperately masking my asking you to check out my music)
So you should do that! Go team go! You can do it! I believe in you!
Okay sorry I&#39;m done.
