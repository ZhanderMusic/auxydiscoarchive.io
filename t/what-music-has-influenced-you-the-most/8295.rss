    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-music-has-influenced-you-the-most/8295</link>
    <description>Just a random thought I thought I&#39;d bring to this wonderful Auxy community space. What artists, songs, albums have influenced you the most? Has this music changed you? Did it open doors to new creative ideas that you never imagined before??

I&#39;d love to see what you all have to say! - SLAM FUNK.</description>

            <p>Thanks man, I’m glad to hear! I’ve moved into the complex and at times very frustrating world of Ableton. Auxy is a fantastic mini DAW because of its simplicity and limitations and I would probably still use it if they didn’t remove the monthly staff picks. The monthly staff picks was a fun way to work on something toward a deadline and all the excitement about being picked.</p>
<p>Hey Auxy team! Bring back the staff picks or something similar (gamification in general) and I’ll join in a heartbeat <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sunglasses.png?v=9" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Back when I was in 8th grade, around 2015ish, I was heavily influenced by trance producers from the Anjunabeats label, most notably Above &amp; Beyond. This was around the time where I started to produce music instead of loops, and also the reason why I have a habit of producing music that’s 4+ minutes long, since trance music tended to be that long.</p>
<p>A&amp;B’s album Group Therapy really helped me through this time since it was also the “darkest” time in all of my life to date. The theming of this album really struck with loss, darkness, melancholy, etc, which really set a theme of which I produced music at that time.</p>
<p>Other producers like Gareth Emery and Armin van Burren are also huge influential artists for me due to their earlier production.</p>
<p>Drum &amp; Bass producers like Matrix &amp; Futurebound, Netsky, Camo &amp; Krooked, just to name a few also inspired me to make faster paced music. If you didn’t know, I only produce Trance and D&amp;B to this day, and it was due to the genres I was into at the time, though, that kind of shifted through the years.</p>
<p>If we’re talking about the Auxy community, some Beat the Clock producers have really influenced me in a way where I can listen to their music freely. Some producers include <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/viiitality">@viiitality</a>, Intepid,    <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/simon2">@simon2</a>, just to name a few, though, these artists are no longer active within the Auxy community.</p>

            <p>You didn’t influence me on writing music, but you helped me persevere and push myself to study mixing and mastering, in a form of a contest, which I think is essential for fantastic EDMs. I sincerely enjoyed the process, and it made a huge difference ( that’s why my other compositions on SoundCloud sound newb ). When I was new here in Auxy Forum ( I used Auxy for 5 months without knowing there’s a community ), you’re the very first one that I clicked.<br>
I’m happy seeing myself to jump around, knowing that I’m now in a circle of aspiring musicians, the community whom I can relate to. Now don’t feel sad for not including you, if you’re still melancholic, here’s a pic of my cat</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/bl0Oqaj2tssq3Uf7ccHuLvPlHY3.jpeg?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f_2_666x500.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bl0Oqaj2tssq3Uf7ccHuLvPlHY3" width="666" height="500" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f_2_666x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f_2_999x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f_2_1332x1000.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/3X/4/f/4f77ff50ffbb790c2c5fc3e92030f8e348f94d9f_2_10x10.png"></a></div><br>
BTW, I didn’t sugarcoat this, every word that I said is true. Yeah, that’s all, thanks for the perseverance. :))<p></p>

            <p>KIVΛ Influenced me to learn Dubstep and Ambient Breaks.<br>
Marshmello and Zeph made me compose Future Bass.<br>
t+pazolite is someone I want to be because of his speedcore songs.<br>
Lo-Fi helped me to ease my anxiety , so I also got into that.<br>
I got inspired to make some Space Music because of Star Wars.<br>
Erik Satie pioneered my Avant-Garde journey, so it’s also a big part.<br>
Some remixes and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/benvacca">@BenVacca</a> also influenced  me to do Trap.<br>
I think that’s all.</p>

            <p>My chill style that I tap into every once and while is like 70% due to Polygrim (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/polygrim/tracks">https://soundcloud.com/polygrim/tracks</a>). Polygrim is from Ukraine and makes really nice lo-fi type vinyl sounding songs. He also makes music and art for Dustryroom Games, one of my favorite Indie game companies. (if you have time you should definitly check him and Dustyroom out)</p>
<p>All my other stuff just comes randomly lmao. I make what sounds good without any influence i guess.</p>
