</aside>
<p>I’d wait till the new update drops before making any changes to the drums.<br>
There are apparently some new drum sounds coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>totally get what you mean by the lost energy shift…shoulda kept the arpeggio going in that bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nono. I’m suggesting that you purposefully drop the energy down there, for a spell.</p>
<p>If anything, I’m suggesting you should strip the arp out completely and give that section a different vibe.<br>
The main vibe feels like it would benefit from a natural rest at that point.</p>
<p>That arpeggio is carrying a lot of the vibe, so resting that (maybe an alt chord progression, maybe in a different key, during that section only) would create the feeling of an extended bridge / breakdown.</p>
<p>Then return to the main vibe, possibly with a bit more peak energy, through to the outro.<br>
(Not suggesting going full-on EDM flava. Maybe just a new, prominent counter-melody using a layered version of the lead sound, for ‘continuity with lift’.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Just my thoughts. YMMV.</p>

            <p>Dude…thanks for the feedback!  Means a lot that you took the time and really listened and broke it down.  Appreciate the props!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did try to be more creative with the drum track on this one (with the down beat on the 1) vs my usual 4/4 go-to beat.  Also, upon further listens, I’m not too crazy about the snare, it just stands out too much…too noticeable where the other percussion is more muted and subtle.  Agree I should have gone more “Edgy”. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>It’s actually the same arpeggio, just faded out and back in. There is that other blip layered on top which perhaps makes it sound like an alt version?  But totally get what you mean by the lost energy shift…shoulda kept the arpeggio going in that bit.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah…I can see that.  To be honest…this was the first draft I put together for this song, and just tinkered with the sounds and automation after putting the initial structure together.  Which is odd because (as you already know) I tend to lean towards more traditional song structure (ie, vocal tracks). I guess I just went with what felt natural and I suppose it ended up sounding like a remix. But I’m OK with that. I may revisit this one again and will definitely take your input into consideration, especially working it into a “vocal” track and working more on the drum patterns/mixing.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for the thoughtful feedback, like, and re-post! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/2.png?v=5" title=":+1:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t2:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been meaning to give some feedback for a while…</p>
<p>OK, so as you probably know from the Like and Repost a week or two ago, I like it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think everything about it is solid.</p>
<p>The intro/build – quality<br>
The panning on the arpeggio – quality<br>
Chord progression - quality<br>
Just a quality piece from start to finish</p>
<p>About the only criticisms I could give – and they would be purely subjective…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I felt the drum pattern was a little bit ‘90s dance remix’, if you know what I mean, whereas everything else would work now. Would have been interested to hear it with a pattern that was a little more ‘edgey’ (no pun intended).<br>
That said, I do appreciate the fact that you avoided a 4/4 and avoided putting a kick on the 1 of the bar, so <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the switch ~3:09, where you switch out the main arpeggio for an alt version. I feel like it could have done with an energy change there, to increase the sense of movement. The main arp has been going so constantly by that point, and the replacement is so similar, that the energy shift isn’t really coming through.<br>
I’m not sure what the solution would be. Maybe it would be double-down on the flowing chords and have an ambient breather, where you strip out the drums and the arp… potentially use an alt chord progression… then return to the main vibe through to the end.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>
<p>And, all that said, I do think what you have is quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
A quick observation…</p>
<p>It actually sounds a little like a remix to me…</p>
<p>The chord progressions and subtle melodies in there really lend themselves to a song.<br>
Maybe it’s because that chord progression stands out as less subtle (in a good way) than those from the rest of the track – so it feels a little like a chorus lift.</p>
<p>That’s why ‘this version’ sounds like the smoothed out remix version.</p>
<p>Have you considered a version worked up as a vocal track?<br>
(I find myself saying that a lot recently. I think I’m projecting. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>No problem. Keep it up! (It would be safe to tag as ambient I think)</p>

            <p>Thanks for listening and for the feedback!  Yeah…I always struggle with snare selection and volume (I was thinking of going with a more muted snare but in the end I went with a more prominent one).</p>
<p>I was hesitant on tagging it as ambient, but it I suppose does have a bit of that feel.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Very nice. I like the flow of the chords and melodies in the background that give it an ambient feel. The drums contrast that a bit but I actually enjoy that about the track. Two things that I would work on, the track is a little long for my taste and many could get bored of it (not saying it’s boring, some people just don’t have long attention spans) and also your snare seems a little bit out of place. Other than that really solid track, can’t wait to hear more from you!</p>
