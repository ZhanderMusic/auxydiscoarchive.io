    <title>Yozy&#39;s Extra Tracks</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/yozys-extra-tracks/21956</link>
    <description>Tell me if this is in the wrong category.

These are extras that I made for fun, my discontinued tracks, or anything I made that was never given a core purpose.

**We Are The Champions Melody Remix**
https://app.auxy.co/projects/orGWxFFXoYDo0AygIlxp7w==
Made in 5 minutes, when my friends were talking about the original song.

**Discontinued**
https://app.auxy.co/projects/A8tHKG-prsf11bHRao1EnA==
A track that was discontinued and eventually evolved into one of my favorite tracks, Electric Heights.

**The Land of Boggs**
https://app.auxy.co/projects/aX8MntOatedd0arKRMBOIg==
A recreation of one of the melodies used in The Land of Boggs shorts (made without affiliation).

**Spray Factory**
https://app.auxy.co/projects/71QvPKUwfFf5NoY3DxyOVA==
A fun little track I made during my first period one day. It mainly uses the instrument &quot;Spray&quot;, hence the name.

**Sci-Fi Facility**
https://app.auxy.co/projects/7slAq4_7LHSjpf-OLrPnOA==
The track was later remastered as Sci-Fi Center and used in Flash Flood 2&#39;s OST. It was a track I made for fun that I made while having Flash Flood 2 in mind, but never intended to make a map for it. I did make a FF2 map for the track after it was remastered.</description>
