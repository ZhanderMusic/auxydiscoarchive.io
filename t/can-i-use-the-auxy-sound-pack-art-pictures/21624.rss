    <title>Can I Use The Auxy Sound Pack Art Pictures?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/can-i-use-the-auxy-sound-pack-art-pictures/21624</link>
    <description>I’d give credit of course, and wouldn’t be using the art for monetary purposes. But I think they’d be cool to use incorporated into song covers when posting to YouTube or something. Not sure who to ask specifically tho!

I’m referring to the art above the demo projects- just for clarification!</description>

            <p>i am pretty sure that these photos are just from sites like unsplash where people post photos that are free for personal use so i guess yeah you can (at least i found the retrofit cover photo there or whatever that retro pack was called)<br>
but lately auxy started to use digital flat art for their pack covers and i think that these are actually theirs</p>
