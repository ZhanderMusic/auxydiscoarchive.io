    <title>I have a problem with the way that drums are tuned</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-have-a-problem-with-the-way-that-drums-are-tuned/5323</link>
    <description>I have a chromatic project that is in the key of D# minor while the settings key is set to G Minor. A note which is not in my key. Hence, my drums sound a bit off (they are tuned to the root) and I dont know how to tune them to the key of the song without painfully going through each of my 80+ scenes and manually transposing all of them up one note so that G is in the key. Any suggestions on how to fix this? @Auxy are all drums tuned to the key or is it just some tonal percussion?</description>

            <p>The app currently tunes the kick only to the selected key. Itâ€™s not possible to work around this with your current setup, but the next update might bring some relief to the situation if you can wait for January.</p>

<p>Afaik, the Key setting tunes the tonal portion of the kick. Not sure about the others, but I suspect not, as Lenberg only mentioned the Kick when <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/search?expanded=true&amp;q=Tune%20key%20%40lenberg">talking about the subject previously</a>.</p>
