            <p>Hi Tomasz,</p>
<p>Thank you as well for the positive feedback!  As I mentioned earlier in this thread, Vince Clarke was a huge influence on me (mostly Yazoo and early Erasure‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Circus‚Äù is a masterpiece IMO), so that is just the sound that comes out when I pull a song together. You should hear a couple of the ideas I‚Äôm playing around with now (unabashedly Clarke sounding).  Maybe I‚Äôm subconsciously writing the music that I wish Vince would write?  Or perhaps Vince is channeling me to write new Erasure music (and I just need to get Mr Bell to do vocals‚Ä¶haha <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">).  The ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù effect is what I strive for as that is what certain songs do for me. So, I‚Äôm glad to hear you say that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:">.  To me, the song is complete, but I can totally see how it feels unfinished since the song structure is clearly begging for vocals. I‚Äôd be down for that if someone wanted to do it, I just don‚Äôt know any vocalists.</p>
<p>I think <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> nailed your style with ‚Äúretro synth‚Äù.  It definitely feels old-school and that‚Äôs a good thing as far as I‚Äôm concerned.  I love your sound choices and use of delay and the flanging wave sound.  Also like how subtle your drums/percussion are.  Have you checked out Fantom ‚Äò87?  If not, I think you‚Äôd like them.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work sir!</p>

            <p>Hi guys,<br>
I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs really nice to read good things about my music! To be honest I wasn‚Äôt sure how to categorize my tracks, but if you say it‚Äôs retro synth style then I guess it is <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now, a few thoughts from me about the track presented in this thread. I really like drum beat - it‚Äôs a catchy rhythm and it makes me feel good. First minute of the track reminds me of Erasure songs.<br>
Besides, the whole track sounds to me a bit like a background for vocal(s) and not the complete/finished piece. Have you already contacted Andy Bell on this matter? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Wow! You read me like a book. I suppose I‚Äôm eternally influenced by the music I grew up listening to (dating myself here) and agree Clarke‚Äôs more recent work has not resonated with me as much as his earlier wizardry, but every once in a while he‚Äôll whip up a song that harkens back to the glory days <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">.  Alan Wilder has also been a huge influence on me over the years (Depeche Mode, Recoil).  Love what he can do with bass sounds, layering and percussion. More recently, I‚Äôve been very enamored by what Tourist has been putting out, especially love his earlier tracks/remixes under the moniker ‚ÄúLittle Loud‚Äù.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always followed a certain structure with my songs (intro, verse, bridge, chorus, bridge, repeat‚Ä¶) so they definitely lend themselves to vocals.  I guess that‚Äôs just what makes the most sense to me, but I‚Äôm always open to trying new things. I‚Äôm obviously a big fan of heavy bass sounds‚Ä¶that‚Äôs what really moves me when listening to a song and I tend to lean toward 80‚Äôs/90‚Äôs bass sounds (favorite Auxy bass sounds: Panda, Flag and Twig, but still exploring others).  I would be thrilled to have others remix my tracks to see where else they could go stylistically.</p>
<p>Following <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yaneeck">@yaneeck</a> now. Really enjoying his sound (thanks for the recommendation).</p>
<p>Appreciate you taking the time to listen and thank you for the feedback.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It‚Äôs clear that you write in a song style, rather than textural EDM instrumentals ‚Äì and I think that‚Äôs refreshing (writing as someone who has a couple of electro-pop tracks part-written and awaiting lyrics/vocals).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I think the production on this one feels like a throwback to the early '90s, which may be on purpose, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs doing the track any favours.</p>
<p>I think the bass sound and drum sound choices are what might be creating the retro pop vibe. Both feel very late '80s/early '90s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Even so, there‚Äôs a strong song idea and good structure in there. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Can‚Äôt help wondering what it would sound like with a more edgy, contemporary electro-pop production.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Who, besides Clarke, inspires you as writers/producers?</p>
<p>I think Clarke is great, certainly a hugely talented and influential figure in electronic/synth pop, but <em>in my opinion</em> his writing and production style never seems to have evolved well to contemporary settings. Even his more recent stuff with Erasure or his remixes still feels a little ‚Äòof their time‚Äô, and would likely mostly (only?) appeal to fans of the knowingly retro end of electro-pop/synth-pop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[Edit‚Ä¶</p>
<p>OK, having listened to a few more of your tracks, it‚Äôs clear to me that you‚Äôve got both feet in the Clarke-esque sound. That‚Äôs cool. I won‚Äôt make any more comments speculating about making it something it doesn‚Äôt want to be. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Also, you should possibly check out <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/yaneeck">@yaneeck</a>.<br>
He‚Äôs a fellow Auxy user working with the (unashamedly) retro synth sound.<br>
Great ear for vibe and structure too.</p>
<p>Could make for an interesting collaboration. Jus‚Äô sayin‚Äô <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
