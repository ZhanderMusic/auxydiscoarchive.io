I hope you guys like it, I definitely do. Give me feedback, all feedback is awesome! 

This song I made is actually based on a dream I recently had sometime between the night of 1/7/20, and the 1st 5 hours of 1/8/20. In the dream, I went on a trip out of town, I went to a club full of teenagers, I met a really nice guy who took me and introduced me to his friends who were a bunch of pretty girls, I became friends with those girls, me and these “dream girls” hung out, had great conversations, and took selfies. Then back in reality, I woke up the next morning and I was sad the next day that none of these dream girls actually existed. It was all just a really good dream.</description>
