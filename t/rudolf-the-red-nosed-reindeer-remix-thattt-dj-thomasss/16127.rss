YES I KNOW, ITS NOT CHRISTMAS YET But I thought it sounded cool. Rudolf the red nosed reindeer is my favorite Christmas song. Sometimes when it really is Christmas, me and my Dad would go to downtown and preform Christmas Carols on our Trumpet together. We make about $60 dollars every time we perform. We always play this song.</description>
