            <p>thanks for your review!  you speak to the point, agree with many things.  But to be honest, working on this track was super boring, I finished it only because I am learning to finish tracks) Before, I had mountains of demos, which in the end remained demo because I did not finish them.  Now I want to finish the ideas purely in principle, in order to gain experience, and understand how to do it) With this track, I will only change the volume of the pad in the breakdown, yesterday I listened to the track in the car, my ears were bleeding from resonance and high volume.  Thanks again for your attention, this is very helpful <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Like the track. Great vibe.</p>
<p>(As I commented on the track) I also like the little synthy melody. It’s adds a nice touch sound-wise, widening slightly the influences it pulls on. (I like stuff with multi-genre influences.)</p>
<p>The only criticisms I’d have…</p>
<p>The kick feels a little light. It could have possibly worked better dropped a few notes to make it more seated in the overall soundscape and mix, and layered with a subtle deeper layer, just to fill it out a little.<br>
Not to go full-on hard punch/boom, but give the kick a bit more colour, richness and more rounded.</p>
<p>Perhaps the kick is also a little short. Makes it feel like it sitting on top of the mix, rather than seated in the mix. (I’m not sure if I’m explaining my thoughts well.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Secondly, given the general vibe of the piece, I think you could have comfortably extended the breakdown beyond the 2:52 mark. The kick came back after only a short break.<br>
There’s a slightly ambient atmos in there, so would have been nice to explore that more during a longer breakdown.</p>
<p>Otherwise, cool piece. Will definitely be revisiting that. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
