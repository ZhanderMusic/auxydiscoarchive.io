            <p>For some reason I totally missed your last few uploads, so this proves again that this forum member of the week thingy is great.<br>
I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a> concerning the drums; they are really cool. I also really like your heavier and more experimental stuff, therefore I’m wondering why you haven’t made extended mixes of ‘Fallen’ and ‘Cataclysm’ yet <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=5" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:">. Keep it up man!</p>

            <p>I’m with Andrew, definitely an underrated Auxy producer. I first heard of you recently when working on the blackocean midnight ramen remix and then again while working on the aUstin Haga changes remix, both of which you did as well and both were super good! Your sound is just really polished and professional sounding, and has a great energy.  I’m  continually impressed with your other songs as well. I don’t feel like I have the best feedback since I’m not to familiar with trap stuff, but I can offer my two cents about music in general. That is: good music is like a good meal, or good piece of visual art, you need contrast, various textures to keep interest, and a cohesive storyline that’s compelling and easy to follow from the beginning to the end. I’m not saying your music is absent if this, but I heard a couple spots where, at least to my ear, there was some opportunity to explore!  Hope that makes sense. Awesome work so far!</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, I’ve already heard a lot of your stuff, it’s really good! Definitely an underrated producer–I can tell you have a lot of talent. I think you’re best at the trap stuff. Only advice I have for you is that I think you should produce more <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p>Listened, liked and followed.</p>
<p>I like your drum tracks; the way you vary them. Sometimes it’s only a single extra beat, but it’s enough to keep it interesting and shows that you’re paying attention to detail.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sunny">@Sunny</a> I originally was gonna have lyrics but the person I wanted to collab with didn’t want to. Does anyone else sing on the forum?</p>
<p>And yeah it is fun collaborating with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/zeph">@Zeph</a></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/phoenix">@Phoenix</a> Man, <strong>Night Fall</strong> could easily have some lyrics to it. I was thinking, “I can imaging a girl sort of softly sing-rapping to this”. It was noice. Then I was rewarded with your collab with HAYVN down at <strong>Falling</strong>. Some of your best works come outta collabs.</p>
<p><strong>Reborn</strong> is real good (and suits your name), and <strong>NIGHTMARE</strong> was phat as, mang (more up my alley with the spooky sounds).</p>
<p>My fave out of all of them was your collab with ZEPH, <strong>RAVE</strong>. I think it’s in need of more plays, and you two make some really tight stuff together.</p>
<p>I think what really impresses me is the quantity of music you’re able to put out!</p>

            <p>Alright… so I’ve listened to most of the rest… well… I like the newer stuff more. Some of the wubs were making my stomach sick. That’s not against you. It happens with pretty much everyone’s music, well the popular people’s Future Bass that is. That being said, I loved every piece that didn’t have wubs in it. Especially your remix of the OG Auxy demo track. I’ve always had a soft spot for that song. You did a fantastic job with it.</p>
<p>I know I’m of a minority opinion on trap and FB wubs and stuff. Sometimes it just makes my stomach turn. I’m weird. Don’t take that as anything personal though please xD I loved everything else.</p>

            <p>I went through your profile and my favorite song was definitely cataclysm! One thing I hear is that in your song there’s usually only one melody going on, a bass or chords, etc. I would try to have more things happening. Ex. Chords, lead, and bass at the same time. Also that will make it easier to make songs longer without being repetitive. Your kicks snares and all that are very good</p>
