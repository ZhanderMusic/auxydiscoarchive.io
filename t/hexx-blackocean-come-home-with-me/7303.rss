            <p>Thank you for the feedback! Honestly I’m glad its just the vocal mixing that seems to be the problem. Because I didn’t mix it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>You might want to have a bit less reverb in the beginning, because mist and similar sounding, high decay instruments will have kind of a “background white noise” effect with too much reverb.</p>
<p>Other than that it’s a great song, and like Andrew Adams said maybe try to blend the vocals a bit more with the track.</p>

            <p>Sounds great, man! You got a good voice, I would just keep working on that mixing (something that I personally struggle with a lot). Also I think you sounded best towards the end when you were in your higher range and putting a lot of emotion into it. More of that I think could sound great.</p>
<p>Also, telling someone to come home with you could be a lot to ask. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
