            <p>First of all. Don’t make that your goal. Make music because you want to for yourself first and foremost. Just get creative with the app, while also making something unique to Auxy.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>Patience<br>
Loving the process<br>
Willingness and eagerness to learn<br>
Easy to follow rhythm<br>
Evolving melodies/drums<br>
Smooth transitions<br>
Good instrument choices<br>
Structured sections<br>
Trial and error (my personal favorite)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve tracked the stat increase for 8 songs that were reposted by Auxy within the past couple months (from the first moment of reposting to 3 weeks later) and the results were not too outstanding to say the least (although this is expected given their follower count). I’ll have to fetch the data from my backup drive but it was something like 50-100 plays, 5-9 likes, 0-2 reposts, 2-8 comments, depending on the track.</p>
<p>Point being here that it might be more worth it to focus energy on getting reposted by different accounts / networks that will have a better shot at getting you exposure. A common method is to run your tracks through “repost chains”, which are essentially collections of accounts that will all repost your song (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and a 5k follower chain might be comprised of 5 1k accounts).</p>
<p>I have a chain which I use for The Auxy Collective (been a work in progress and we’re getting to some bigger numbers now) which reposts Auxy songs not only to Auxy users but to other audiences as well. Most label owners also own a repost chain and if you network with them and ask nicely they might run a track or two of yours through it.</p>
<p>So it’s something to consider.</p>

            <p>Getting reposted by Auxy seems to be a common goal here, despite their modest ~3400 follower count.<br>
Nickelback on the other hand, has ~73600 followers.</p>

            <p>There’s no rhyme or reason, there’s no secret sauce.</p>
<p>It seems like an account used by the devs to post music <em>they like</em> that also happens to be created using Auxy. It doesn’t mean stuff not reposted is bad. It’s the same reason I won’t (and you won’t and anyone won’t) listen to certain genres, just for example - you like what you like, and that’s that pretty much <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>There’s no tea leaves to read here is what I’m saying. The best bet is regular engagement with other musicians who will help spread the word about you, and also to engage any fans you do have. Updates, blogs, contests, live streams etc etc etc.</p>

            <p>There’s a lot of theories about how to get reposted. Some involve ritualistic animal sacrifice, some involve praying to the gods of RNG, some involve a multitude of other things.</p>
<p>Some things that can help though are connecting with bigger Auxy producers and asking for help/feedback, to get yourself on their radar. That has seemed to have an impact. Other things involve working in big collaborations across the community, those tend to get highlighted to showcase the app accordingly.</p>
<p>Really, the Auxy repost system is intended to be a showcase of the app’s capacities. If you got something really special, it’s more likely to get noticed as opposed to something done before.</p>
<p>This is all just conjecture though.</p>
