    <title>Thank you Auxy!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/thank-you-auxy/15329</link>
    <description>Thank you.  Just wanted to say that. I started using Auxy in 2016, summertime, and for a while, although I enjoyed the app, I wondered if one could make an actual track in it, as opposed to just a sketch of an idea. Now, in 2019, there is no question in my mind,  I can make proper tracks that I would release solely using Auxy, with a bit of postproduction. That has been a huge leap forward, and while there are still limitations to it, they are balanced out by the complete ease of use and accessibility. With each sound pack, and greater sampling capabilities, it just keeps getting better and better.  Again, thanks to the developers, keep up the good work, and never forget the simple elegance of the interface you have created.</description>
