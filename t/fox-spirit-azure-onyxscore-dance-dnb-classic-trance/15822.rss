I&#39;ve actually had fun making this track, mainly because of the newly released soundpack which included a classic piano.

This is inspired by the classic early 2000&#39;s hit songs that took over the radio. It still has an enormous impact of my childhood, but I am aware that&#39;s not the same with others. 

But anyways, enjoy the track, this took less time than I was expecting it to be.</description>
