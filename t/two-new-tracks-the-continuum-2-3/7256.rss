    <title>Two New Tracks! The Continuum #2&amp;3</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/two-new-tracks-the-continuum-2-3/7256</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! Sorry for all the late songs for The Continuum series. Since the incident of some Auxy members not able to post songs; it’s finally working again.

The two tracks I’m posting are Doritun and Legonds of Zelda Main Theme. The second song it’s just something to help me get to the top of my song list. The LoZ Main theme is a remix. 

Well I don’t have much to talk about. Here are all the songs.

The Continuum #3: [Legonds Of Zelda - Tropical Remix](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/legends-of-zelda-tropical)

You all have a wonderfull day!</description>
