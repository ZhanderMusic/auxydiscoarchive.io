Just working on the first 16 bars of this legendary song is enough to make me go crazy. But then again, I am reminded that I&#39;m working on this past my normal bedtime by around 3 hours.

**[If you haven&#39;t heard the original song/wanted a refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwqmJilXxJY)**

For me, I plan to recreate the Club Radio Edit, or the 4 Clubbers version, which if you haven&#39;t heard, [sounds like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfSkpAdDhZ8). I chose this version because sounds much more interesting in my ears. If you want me to recreate the original version, feel free to tell me.</description>
