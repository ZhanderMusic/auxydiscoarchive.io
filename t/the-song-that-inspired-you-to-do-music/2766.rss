    <title>The song that inspired you to do music</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/the-song-that-inspired-you-to-do-music/2766</link>
    <description>A week ago, I made a topic called “The artist that inspired you,” and since then, it became a trend here in Auxy Disco. So, Imma make a similar topic, but instead of Artist, I want to know what song inspired you the most. || The song that inspired me was Porter Robinson - Shepherdess.</description>
