    <title>When you&#39;re the producer of a song w/ vocals(SOLVED)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/when-youre-the-producer-of-a-song-w-vocals-solved/5751</link>
    <description>And you think the vocals sound kinda bad and cheesy, what do you do? Do you upload it still, even if it sounds bad? What if this a song you want to upload to iTunes? If not, how do you tell the vocalist that it doesn&#39;t sound up to par with the production quality you want?</description>

            <p>I strongly agree with this. Bad vocals can totally ruin the quality of your production.</p>

            <p>I would suggest you send them a melody of what you have in mind so they can match the rhythm and pitch. It is easier to follow the melody than it is to interpret through words.</p>
<p>And be nice. Most amateur singers are overly self conscious/shy of their voice.</p>

            <p>Other options…</p>
<ol>
<li>Put it on hold (unreleased), not scrap the project</li>
<li>Release provisionally as an instrumental (musical accompaniment) for a vocal track*.</li>
<li>Rework, if needed, so it works as a stand-alone instrumental without vocals.</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases 1 and 2, you could then continue looking for a more suitable vocalist, so you’re still working towards the version you had in your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* I’ve done this with a couple of my own pieces, getting them up on SC, while I ( non-urgently) find lyricists and vocalists that I’d like to collaborate with, and complete the tracks.</p>
<p>Of the dozen or so pieces I have in early development at the moment, the ones I’m most excited about are all tracks intended to be finished with vocals.</p>

            <p>Maybe better to have no vocals than bad* vocals - unless it’s presented as a demo (and maybe not even then…)</p>

            <p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I only made one song with vocals in it. And that song was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/stardust-feat-nick-lecroix">Stardust.</a><br>
It was pretty recent, so I can’t tell the difference between good vocals and bad vocals.</p>

            <p>Just tell the vocalist that their vocals didn’t work with the track. If it’s because of their actual voice then just tell them that it won’t work. If it’s because the sound quality isn’t perfect or things got messed up, the vocalist can either redo it or move on. I just added one word to my newest song but I spent over 30 minutes editing it so it sounded decent. Although it’s painful, sometimes you just gotta scrap it and start over.</p>

            <p>That is a tough situation, and unfortunately a common one in the world of music production. Anytime you work with someone else there are bound to be differences in ideas, taste, quality of production, etc. It can be tough when you want to keep doing re-takes to get something exactly right and everyone else is okay with it as-is. I think there are several factors to consider, and for simplicity, you could put it into three areas:  (1) your reputation/integrity as an artist (be true to yourself and don’t compromise), (2) relationships with other artists/networking (don’t be a jerk), and (3) big picture/human decency (step back, take a breath, is it as big of a deal as it seems?).</p>
<p>As for (1)  your reputation/integtrity as an artist depends, probably above all, on what is produced in your name. In your case that means having bad vocals will reflect badly on you as a producer. This is a hard rule because it means making some hard decisions. For example, there was a drummer who recorded a whole album with the Foo Fighters, but later found out frontman Dave Grohl secretly re-recorded the drums himself for the whole album because he wanted a different sound. Although this was extremely upsetting for the first drummer, it’s hard to argue with the Foo fighter’s success. And, knowing the styles of each drummer myself, I would say it was the right decision as far as the success of the Foo fighters was concerned. However, it brings us to the second factor, (2) relationships with other artists/networking. As in many other areas of life, many of the opportunities you will have as an artist will depend on the people you know, especially if it’s a sincere, real friendship with them. Plus it’s just classy and cool to be a loyal, decent person.  Also, your chances for working with cool artists will eventually depend on your reputation for working with others. There are some Auxy producers that we all would like to work with, and some not so much. Even if you are awesome at producing, if you are rigid and always think you are right people won’t want to work with you. So there is a balance between keeping your integrity and being able to work well with others. This will not only help your chances for making sweet collabs, is just cool when people can work well with others. In my opinion, those who do often make great music in general because they are great people. Lastly (3) Big picture/human decency, it’s sometimes helpful to step back and assess if we are taking ourselves too seriously. When all is said and done, is this track so important that you can’t afford to have it less than perfect, or is it better to just work with a lot of people this early in your career and build a lot of good friendships? Is this something you could ask the vocalist to redo, or would that not be a good idea for their personality? It’s a question only you can answer since it has to do with what you value. Some artists don’t work with others, don’t even reply to comments, and produce super high quality tracks, but possibly not thought of the best in the artist community, and limit themselves that way. Others collab with anyone, which can possibly cause their sound to suffer, but they have great relationships and more opportunities in that way. I personally tend to lean that way because I feel the only way to be relevant and lively as an artist is to be connected to others, but then again that’s just my values <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grinning.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>If you do decide the vocals are not cutting it, I’ve found it best to point out strengths first, and then be very specific about why it doesn’t work, if possible. If the vocals are unsalvageable, however, point out the strengths but then just say something like, “I’m sorry, but the vocals just aren’t working for me. I’m thinking I want to take it another direction. I really appreciate you collabing with me though!”</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>IN my song, It’s not the mixing, really. It’s the singing. There are these cheesy sounding harmonies and runs that don’t really fit into the song.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get someone to sing over Vision, if that helps.</p>

            <p>If you got a vocalist and didn’t like the vocals, you’ll  just have to say so. If I were you, instead of just saying it’s bad you could say something like: Hey, sadly your vocals didn’t match my exact vision.</p>

            <p>You’re gonna have to break it to them, or just edit it to make it sound good, like do you thing Trippie Redd or Post Malone can actually sing? Lol no they’ve just get a lot of editing done</p>

            <p>And you think the vocals sound kinda bad and cheesy, what do you do? Do you upload it still, even if it sounds bad? What if this a song you want to upload to iTunes? If not, how do you tell the vocalist that it doesn’t sound up to par with the production quality you want?</p>
