    <description>Does anyone know how to change the pitch of samples without changing its speed in Auxy or any 3rd party app?</description>

            <p>I don’t believe there are apps specifically for this, nothing I’m familiar with.</p>
<p>Beatmaker 3 (and maybe 2?) offer time stretch. Cubasis in a more recent version does as well. I have NO idea how well they work, I never used it. You’re looking for an app that can do time stretching (as opposed to sample speed up/slow down, with they all do more or less).</p>
<p>When you get into these kinds of features you’re talking more “pro” level, which usually means a “pro” price. GarageBand on Mac might do this. Logic, Ableton Live and Reason all do this. I am sure FL Studio (desktop) does as well.</p>
<p>Oh, Auria on iOS might too.</p>
<p>EDIT: As a quick side note, Blocs Wave does a decent job stretching and keeping key, BUT, it’s an IAP to unlock sample import and you need to know the original key and tempo. That would probably be the most inexpensive way to accomplish what you’re looking to do on iOS.</p>
