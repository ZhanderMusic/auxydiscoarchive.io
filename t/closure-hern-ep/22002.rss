    <title>Closure - Hern [EP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/closure-hern-ep/22002</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a new EP I guess lol, probably not gonna go back to this style as it was really hard for me to work with and I&#39;ve been moving on to more straight electronic sounds. Was inspired a lot by post rock and progressive rock for this EP. 

Link is here (Runtime - 27:42): https://soundcloud.com/hernmusicofficial/sets/closure?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing 

Hope you guys enjoy, constructive criticism always welcome.</description>
