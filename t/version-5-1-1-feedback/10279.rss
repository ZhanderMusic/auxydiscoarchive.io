    <title>Version 5.1.1 Feedback</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/version-5-1-1-feedback/10279</link>
    <description>There are many great improvements in this and the last update, especially loop labels and repaired scene labels, and I&#39;m very happy with the subscription sounds.  I&#39;m really trying to adjust to the new layout (iPad), but a few things inhibit work flow on the kind of stuff I&#39;m doing.

**Play button size/location**

I didn&#39;t realize how much I used the play button until it had moved, shrunk, and had its outer-ring bar counter removed.  I spend a ***lot*** of time restarting over and over from a given point in the loop editor, while getting chord progressions or polyphonic voices right -- with and without soloing.  It is equivalent to the space bar in a DAW, and I would be similarly thrown off if, say, Pro Tools or Logic decided to switch to the &#39;b&#39; key instead.  It&#39;s a smaller, farther away, and less-peripherally-visible target now, especially without its ring.

**Play button scene bar counter ring**

When mixing live/processed acoustic piano with Auxy, in ambient music, there&#39;s no longer a way to know precisely where you are in a scene -- so as to know when to come in.  Also, the dots indicator in the loop editor is difficult for me to grok at a glance, vs. what was on the play button.

**Scene bar count/offset indication**

As much as I hate to admit it, I&#39;m middle-aged now, and my eyesight isn&#39;t perfect. With a programming job and kids, most of my music time is late night, when my eyes are already tired to begin with, so I keep the brightness down low.  While the 5.1.1 indication is clearer than 5.1, at a glance I still can&#39;t see an immediately-discernible difference between 3 and 4, or 7 and 8.  I end up using the [label](https://soundcloud.com/wagneric/20180526-auxy-5-1-1-test) for indicating the bar count + offset, which requires maintenance as I change things around.  I have a music/math brain, that &quot;does&quot; numbers, and losing a concise and precise indication has been a step down in terms of keeping track of song structure.  I recently spent a week using the old (green icon) Auxy, and loved seeing the clear bar/beat indicator that you get while recording;  I missed having a play button but being able to loop a single bar helped immensely.

Last, I always put an empty scene at the end to make sure the &#39;verb trail doesn&#39;t get cut off (which it does without it), and now there is no indication of how many bars are there.

**Broken stuff**
* Kiss pitch automation
* Runner pan
* Cinema pan
* Grain and Chalk (pianos) pan -- unless these are intended to be explicitly monophonic
* Telecoms low-pass glitchy at/near full counter-clockwise


**Nitpicks**

* Chromatic should be able to be selected as the default for new projects
* I don&#39;t like that the scene progress bar is discontinuous now (would benefit from some kind of bar/scene markers in either case, like 1px vertical stripes in a different color)
* Export is awkward to get to in settings
* Reverb trail gets cut off too soon
* Need a real time counter (Auxy Music Creator had one in the playback)
* Would be so nice to be able to custom configure the layout
* In the key of C, would be great if the pianos went all the way down at least to A0
* Single-bar playback in the loop editor would be great
* Unable to change drum kit (even among originals) on really old projects

**General concerns**

This app has the potential to be a very professional tool.  I would feel better knowing in advance when and what features are going to be moved or removed, absent the opportunity for specific feedback first.  I&#39;ve gotten so much enjoyment out of Auxy I would probably keep a subscription for a few years (regardless of whether there were new/good sounds), out of gratitude alone, but if there were another update like 5.1 I would likely wait for a less-unfavorable-to-me redesign to come along in the future before upgrading.</description>

            <p>Nah, it goes on to say “solely and never for any other purpose than for the operation of the App (or future software, applications and services provided by Auxy that are similar to those represented by the App) and as necessary to allow you to share your Music with other users of the App.”<br>
I don’t personally feel like that’s a big deal. If I were to make a very successful track I’d be thrilled for them to demo my production.<br>
Auxy would still have to be cautious about sounds an artist has used in their composition that the artist has rights to that Auxy does not, so while they could demo your production for educational purposes, if you have non-Auxy sounds that you have license to or that are your own IP they’re not likely to risk it for anything else. You’re not going to see Auxy advertise, publish, or publicly brag about a user’s work. Not without the artist’s  permission.<br>
Also, just using myself as an example, there’s still a lot that Auxy can’t do that a big DAW can, so if they were to use one of mine (again just as example) it would sound pretty different from a finished track that has gone through my DAW and/or through a studio mastering process.</p>

<p>With the introduction of 5.1.1, most exports are now named. However, from time to time, the above happens. What exactly is the cause of this, and is it fixable? It adds yet another export cycle to my routine that I’d much rather avoid, and this isn’t the only time it’s happened either. It’s happened at least four times, if not more without me even realizing it.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I’m not quite following the situation you’re describing.</p>
<p>If there’s an issue with any user’s song/project, are they really going to open it (from where?), edit it, resave it and reshare it?</p>
<p>Or, in the case of an audio file, open it in editing software, clip out the ‘offending portion’, resave, etc…?</p>
<p>If it’s to do with revising demo projects, then they can edit that without the need for T&amp;Cs, as it’s their creation.<br>
If it’s a user project created by developing a demo project, then again, I don’t see what need Auxy has to edit that user’s file.</p>
<p>I don’t understand.</p>

<p>The thing I can imagine this being would be to make sure there’s only a small portion of the song, if ever there was an instance where the entire song was made open as the demo project, as has happened previously if memory serves correctly, even in some instances where every loop is still available even if unused in the demo provided. More recent projects have had excess loops trimmed off, possibly by those terms.</p>

<p>Are you tracking use of different scales/modes? (albeit anonymised).</p>
<p>I’d be curious to know the % of projects utilising Chromatic mode and curious too to know if that % increases as users experience with the app and music making develops.</p>

            <p>That one’s a little odd. Seems a little overkill, legally speaking.<br>
Auxy is a creation tool, not a publishing platform (which is where you’d normally see a T&amp;C like that).</p>
<p>As a creation tool, it should be simple for Auxy to indemnify themselves against any use of the tool to create infringing works – e.g. by using Auxy to create music that uses uncleared samples – without reserving the right to edit user project files.</p>
<p>Even if it were, simply reserving the right to remove any Auxy-hosted instances of infringing works should be enough. Of course, they’ll also/always reserve the right to terminate any subscription and block any user.<br>
(Pretty standard.)</p>
<p>[Edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>featured tracks; Auxy hosting remixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahaa, of course. I always forget that as I rarely ever look in the feed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Still, I don’t see how they’d ever need to edit a user’s project, or even have any control over the final output, as opposed to simply reserving the right to remove any Auxy-hosted instances.</p>

            <p>I’m guessing that has something to do with featured tracks, but I could be wrong. It’s most likely a lot of legalese that will make sure they are protected in case something were to happen.</p>

            <p>Something to think about in terms of end-user QOL is how far a small bug fix can go as far as user experience. I’m not an expert by any stretch in terms of the inner workings of Auxy, but certain seemingly low risk potential bug fixes like enabling projects to retain their chromatic setting when set would appear to be very worth pursuing, unless it would actively undermine and prevent you from working on significantly bigger tasks.</p>
<p>(Similar to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a>…) I’m also curious as to what your metrics are for determining what percentage of users are affected by a given bug or the severity in which the bug affects user experience (this is extending more generally in terms of bug reports, not just this one). I would think it hard to obtain such data especially to an accurate degree and/or containing a sufficient sample size, which would also limit the effectiveness of determining which updates are best to focus on based on this data alone (or to a significant degree).</p>
