    <title>What category does this song fit in? (+feedback would be nice too)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-category-does-this-song-fit-in-feedback-would-be-nice-too/914</link>
    <description>Just a quick little question;

Im not new to the music genre, but I&#39;m not really used to actually posting songs themselves. with Auxy, it is so much easier to just pop some notes down and make a melody.

Anyways,I was just wondering, does this song fit in ambient, trance, or the electric genre?
