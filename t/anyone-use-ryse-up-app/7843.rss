    <title>Anyone use Ryse Up app?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-use-ryse-up-app/7843</link>
    <description>Anyone here use the ![image|18x18](upload://da5l7prhLUcF5FWFQALP6GL99fB.jpg) [RYSE UP](http://ryseup.com/) app?

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; RYSE puts emerging creatives in front of major artists for opportunities to be discovered.

&amp;nbsp;
I&#39;m on the lookout for a creative partner for writing and production, as well as female vocalists for a couple of electro-pop tracks. So, I thought I&#39;d take a look.

It&#39;s a real mixed bag. Some clearly serious users with experience. But others try-hards make it feel like a hook-up app.

It does seem to have a heavy slant towards rap and r&amp;b.

&amp;nbsp;
I know only a few here collab outside of the community, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone here&#39;s checked it out — and found it useful.</description>
