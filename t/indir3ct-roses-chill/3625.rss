    <description>Hey everyone! Been working on a new Chill track with a bunch of chords! My main focus recently has been to work on putting together chords to make my tracks sound professional! Also, I got Amuse.io and I hope to soon get songs out on Itunes/Spotify/Etc.! Any feedback, comments, support, would be extremely appreciated. Thanks everyone for your support!!!
