    <title>Use of other music software</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/use-of-other-music-software/8574</link>
    <description>I am aware of the fact that Medly is in all ways inferior to Auxy. Yet the app is still sitting in my music folder along with Auxy, GarageBand, and other similar apps. 

Now you might be thinking: “Why would you do this, V/M?” “I thought you were loyal to Auxy”

If so, please chill.

Auxy is _awesome_, perhaps the best free software on the market. Apps that produce good-quality programmable drums and synths are extremely hard to find. We know Medly sucks. We know it has a reputation of ripping Auxy off, and that there is no competition against Auxy and Medly. 
But Medly isn’t _evil_. It isn’t going to _kill_ you if you still use it. You won’t be judged by anyone, except those inconsiderate people online, if you choose to share that you have Medly.
Also, Medly has one thing that makes it a tad easier to invent melodies that Auxy doesn’t have. When you are on the page to create music, you’ll notice this: 
![image|690x459](upload://8U27KcXWfF5QQ2NpIABhCcUYeyS.jpeg)

The notes of the scale are displayed on the board, giving younger musicians a little more help and inspiration. Maybe you don’t benefit from this. But other people could. I have no doubt. Auxy is still my personal favorite, don’t get me wrong, but when you think about Medly, think of it as a secondhand tool and Auxy as your main tool. Or FL studio, Novation soundboard, Etc., if you are serious about it.

I’ve found that GarageBand is helpful, too, especially to mix your tracks and to remix others tracks. Also, the drum sequencer in GB is almost equally as powerful as Auxy’s, if not better. In addition to softening beat sections, you can decrease the chance they are played. I find that it’s helpful with creating ultra-spicy HipHop beats, when you need those extra hats and Auxy’s precision isn’t making the cut. 

This is all just my opinion about other music services. If you have a reason you like using multiple resources with Auxy (like a recording device or FX software) feel free to share.</description>

<p>In addition to this, an understanding of music theory will also help supplement such an idea. If you really want to understand music theory, there are many websites and videos that are very useful for learning things such as rhythms, chords, and other things. I will link a few resources below. Most people who seek to <em>really</em> understand how music works should learn some degree of Music Theory as it helps tremendously.</p>

            <p>Funny thing about Auxy and Medley is neither of them have live note recording, but even Medley has that tiny vertical keyboard you can at least try stuff out before you program it.   Basically they should both have live recording.  I don’t think anyone was using Figure and saying “boy this sucks, I wish I had a grid of tiny squares “</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know. That’s the setting I was referring to in my post. That setting only means that new loops within that project will be Chromatic, so I’m required to change it <em>every time I start a new project</em>. That gets pretty annoying after the first few times, let alone for every single one of the possibly hundreds of new projects I’ve started.</p>
<p>As mentioned, I only ever use - and only ever want to use - Chromatic. I don’t want or need my hand held, but I do want the flexibility and freedom of Chromatic, that makes all options possible.</p>
<p>For an app that’s supposedly built on simplifying the UX and removing obstacles blocking music making, anything that repeatedly interrupts a user’s flow, especially on a fundamental aspect of their composing, is a fundamental UX failure.</p>
<p>I fail to understand why they didn’t make that possible in one of the early updates. (It’s not that difficult.)</p>
<p>(Fwiw, Medly’s solution to the same issue is vastly superior to Auxy’s.)</p>

            <p>Two things:</p>
<p>A) The creators of Auxy designed it to be intuitive and easy to use. For some people, the chromatic function is very confusing. Nevertheless it’s a great tool, and we all can agree that some users are used to it by now. But remember when you just leaned about the term “chromatic” and what it did? My guess is that it was difficult to make music without using the major/minor scale. Or in other cases, it just came naturally. I don’t know what your case was; maybe it was different.</p>
<p>B) And <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a>, there is a setting similar to what you’re describing. Under the “scale” section there is an option to make new loops chromatic. Turn it on and any new loops you make should be chromatic automatically.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Forcing people to take the hard route is never a good idea. A big part of what draws people to Auxy is its ease of use and it’s simplicity. Forcing people who have little musical experience to use chromatic mode might be discouraging and cause them to quit music production because it is “too hard”. The option is always there though, so when they get the hang of making music they can start using that.</p>
<p>I just don’t see the benefit in setting chromatic as default, as the majority of people who use Auxy use it because it’s easy and simple.</p>

</aside>
<p>I only ever use Chromatic. I’ve requested that the Chromatic setting be persistent - i.e. if you last set it Chromatic mode in any project, it stays as the default for new projects, until you change it again.</p>
<p>So, I wouldn’t have to keep changing the same settings every time I start a new project.</p>
<p>However, I’m not sure Lenberg appreciates the value of that option.</p>

            <p>I can agree on some terms, for example, auxy only uses minor and major’s, to what I’m aware of, but other young people don’t want to use the normal scale because it’s too difficult to use, so that limits them, even if there is chromatic mode, why would young people use it if they could make way better sounds in non chromatic mode, or normal scale. I guess what I’m trying to say is if chromatic mode was the default, then the newer younger group would be more exposed to that, and trying new things. That’s all my opinion though.</p>

            <p>I am truly not sure why people continue to say that Medly is in all ways inferior to Auxy. It’s more friendly to free users in some ways and with the new Master pack, it has some really neat samples. My impression was that the irrational hate on using Medly (and in some ways other music apps that aren’t Auxy) was done for the most part, and then I read posts like these and I’m not so sure. There’s nothing wrong with using more than one app to make music.</p>
<p>With that said, having been an unbiased user of all three apps, they’re good for different purposes. I wouldn’t necessarily use GarageBand as a quick, easy access piano roll. And I wouldn’t use Auxy as my primary method of native samples.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to give other apps a try. No app can do everything–that’s why people make different ones to accomplish different purposes.</p>

            <p>My bad, for not being more clear. Although, I disagreed about GB’s (compared to back in the day;)) ease of use;  Auxy is HANDS DOWN  the way more intuitive studio (Imo)!  GB was/is easy though; was from the outset! …Sadly <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> because that means I must be ye olde. DOH! Lol</p>
<p>*But, I have to tell ya,…GB should be at minimum; something you should learn. Your excuse was classic! …Frustrating &amp; time consuming; WELCOME, to recording!! GB should be on your belt. It’s a simplified dream. As far as, taking the past for granted. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I used to use that, and I have to say it’s really intuitive and easy to use on Mac. It feels like “Logic Pro Lite” in a way on there.</p>
<p>When they made the iOS version, however, it just was terrible imo. It’s possible to make good sounding music on it, and I’ve heard some amazing stuff that comes out of there, but it takes way longer as the interface is not intuitive and very difficult to navigate. So yeah, I agree. And I don’t think your opinion is unpopular.</p>

<p>In terms of electronic composition using software, auxy feels much more intuitive than GarageBand <strong>for iOS</strong>. Putting in notes <strong>on iOS</strong> is frustrating and time consuming. Not to mention it takes a lot longer overall to use.</p>
<p>I have no experience with ye old music recording, nor do I with Mac desktop GarageBand. Maybe it’s different on there, but my experience wasn’t that enjoyable. Especially for what I was trying to use it for.</p>

<p>Hi All! I’m relatively new here, but I had to chime in. I’m confused, because Auxy does this! I put in Chromatic &amp; turn my phone horizontal &amp; wahlah!</p>

            <p>e.g. You could play (or even write) a simple melody, if it’s written simply as a note sequence.</p>
<p>It’s limited, but still potentially useful.</p>
<p>I’m reasonably certain that I’d be better at writing music now, if I’d developed the early habit of paying attention to actual notes - rather than doing everything by ear.</p>

            <p>It was helpful when I knew <em>some</em>  music theory, but wasn’t familiar with scales in Auxy. And when you’re in the scale mode and not the harmonic mode, it’s so much easier to find the notes you need. If you know the names of the notes you’re pressing, but don’t remember where they are on the scale, Medly’s function comes in handy.</p>
