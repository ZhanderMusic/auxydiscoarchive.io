    <title>Sample tune advice</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/sample-tune-advice/20503</link>
    <description>I’ve been tasked with creating a Minecraft-inspired tune for a potential video game score prospect. Any Minecrafters here to tell me if it has a similar vibe?

            <p>Yeah, I think it was off as well. I didn’t get the gig, so it appears the dev agreed. Heheh I appreciate the feedback.</p>

            <p>Eh. I think that it’s to soft. Most Minecraft songs that play (I play on Java) have a simple melody that are clear and usually don’t have lots of space and reverb. I think that it’s good but it needs to be more simplistic. Just make the melody a light pluck with no reverb or delay or space. Then add very simple drums. The Minecraft music is very simple so make urs simple.</p>
