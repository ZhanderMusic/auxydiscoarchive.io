[/poll]

so i was thinking... if i wanna make money off of my music, i should put them on spotify... but if i made it available on soundcloud too people would naturally go there instead since it’s free to listen there. then again, if i put it only on spotify there’s the danger that it won’t get any plays... let me know what you think would work better.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve zero experience with the music industry, but I actively read and research to understand the industry better.<br>
I like to know what I’m getting into. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>And perhaps age and my work (I work in the creative parts of digital marketing, which often involves pitching) allows me to know what to look for in an offer and judge it in terms of an investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I asked the person to give me some outlines about what I got for the money and assessed it against what I understand about the market.</p>
<p>I didn’t necessarily ask the right questions first time (still learning). Even though he answered the questions that I asked, he didn’t offer up any of the info that I would expect someone with a good offer to mention.</p>
<p>He didn’t mention monthly plays on the playlist*, number of shares via the playlist, etc… – which would hint at what kind of ‘reach’ and exposure my track might get.</p>
<p>He didn’t mention a benchmark sales figure based on the best selling artist on the label.</p>
<p>* I made sure to look at the number of plays of tracks on there, included the most played. All those I checked on the playlist had fewer than 1000 plays (Spotify doesn’t state the exact number if it’s lower than 1000)</p>
<p>If the plays and sales numbers were good, he’d mention them. The fact that he didn’t was a flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
He didn’t mention whether he would promote it on the YouTube channel (30K+ subs), but only around 2000–5000 views per video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Similarly, I looked around the label’s online presence, including social channels. Wasn’t much to find. No website and little to no social activity by the label.</p>
<p>The label was a sub-label and had no site of its own and no section on the parent label site.<br>
The parent label site wasn’t available in English and was broken in parts.</p>
<p>Flag. Flag. Flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The very limited promotion on offer had no real exposure value, so this effectively boiled down to an overpriced distribution offer – to get <span class="bbcode-u">one track</span> up on the usual outlets.</p>
<p>And why do that, when I can do any number of tracks for free on something like <a href="http://Amuse.io">Amuse.io</a>?</p>

            <p>May I ask, other than being spooked out because it was a <em>10 year</em> contract, how did you realise that you should turn it down? The prospect of recieving a contract like that is absolutely foreign to me, and I would have been quite naive going about responding to it, as I think most of this forum would, had we been in your situation. “Where did you learn this stuff?”/“What is your experience?” is what I’m trying to ask, I guess. Though, you’ve probably already mentioned your life story in a different topic.</p>

            <p>I get that aspect, but I’m seeing examples where artists talk about creating their own label for their own music output.</p>

<p>I certainly see it more and more.</p>
<p>As with my story above, unless a 3rd-party label is able to really multiply your fan base, over what you can do without them (or want to bother doing), then creating your own label - or remaining technically unsigned - is the only option that makes sense.</p>

            <p>It seems like common sense that the promotion that major labels give would still overshadow “going solo” in this day and age. The industry hasn’t reached the stage (and probably never will) where major labels like Universal, Sony and Warner have become redundant in favor for independently distributed music.</p>
<p>But as I say that, with everyone making their own labels, maybe there will be a time where the term “label” is changed and is seen as a common thing to do as a solo act.</p>
<p>Btw I was just on the page to source data I found in google images. I have no appetite for clickbaity sh*t lol. Referenced it because they said they sourced and visualised the data.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>“An Unsigned Artist Makes 4X More from Streaming Than a Major Label Artist“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title of that linked article is a bit deceptive and clickbait-y.</p>
<p>It’s likely that it’s still better to be on a major label as the promotional push they can give will result in you attracting more fans than you might on your own.<br>
Even though it means a smaller slice of the pie, it’s a much bigger pie and you’ll ultimately be receiving more money.</p>
<p>I’d much rather have 25% of £100K than 100% of £10K.</p>

            <p>One key thing to notice about what the graphic tells you…</p>
<p>It’s generally not worth signing up with a label unless they can <em>at least</em> double your streams/sales - which any decent label should be able to do.</p>
<p>It’s not ultimately about percentages, it’s about whether being on that label actually puts more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Little story…</p>
<p>I was recently ‘offered’ the opportunity by a music producer vlogger (known to some here) to sign one of my tracks on one of their labels.</p>
<p>Problem was, it would cost <em>me</em> money, it would be a 10-year contract and there was no mixing, mastering or promotion being offered - other than inclusion on the lable’s Bandcamp page (tiny following) and the label’s Spotify playlist with fewer than 1500 followers. I would keep 100% of all revenue.</p>
<p>It effectively boiled down to me paying to get one track up on the usual channels and be included in one small playlist*. I would need to handle all other promotion myself.</p>
<p>I passed.</p>
<p>(* Paid inclusion/promotion on prominent playlists is part of the game these days. But in this case, I wasn’t convinced that the cost represented a good investment. I considered doing it out of curiosity, but the 10-year contract spooked me - though I didn’t bother asking to see the contract itself before declining.)</p>

<p>It likely mostly refers to things like CDs sold via Bandcamp, which are still classed as ‘self-distributed’. Bandcamp just helps take the order and process the payment.</p>
<p>Of course, you could sell via your own website too. There are plenty of ecommerce options available.</p>

            <p>What it means is how much each method of music distribution is worth investing in as a musician to get the most revenue. You see up the top of the graphic it says “self-distributed album CD”? That’s like standing on the path in Los Angeles and selling your music to random pedestrians <small>(wanna check out my <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"> mixtape?)</small>.</p>
<p>I actually heard someone on disco was at a market and sold their music for 40 odd bucks. The plus is that you get all the money to yourself (i.e. no paying services to “house” your music).</p>
<p>After that, it shows how much each service online pays the artist for their purchases/streams. Bandcamp, for example, is quite high on the charts as a service to put your music on, as it pays a lot back to the artist, in comparison to, say, YouTube.</p>

            <p>I think it would be a good idea only if you can make enough songs to put a couple Spotify exclusive. Like for me, I have been slow recently on dropping new songs so it wouldn’t be a great idea because I wouldn’t be able to provide for both. And I would want to spend a month on a song just for it to get only a couple views on Spotify.</p>
