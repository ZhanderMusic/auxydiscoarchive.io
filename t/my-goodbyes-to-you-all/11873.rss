    <title>My Goodbyes To You All</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-goodbyes-to-you-all/11873</link>
    <description>So This has been a mixed year. I first found Auxy in July of 2017, I had always wantes to create music but could never afford the software. 

I remember this was when I was in Canada with some friends when I found the app and have been writing tracks on it ever since. 

As some of you may know I have had bad times throughout the year (as most teenagers do it seems) music has been the perfect escape for me and to that I thank the developers for creating this. 

Now i‚Äôm not going to pull a DJ_La_Rocca and write the entire bible as a goodbye so i‚Äôm going to keep it short as to why: This past year has been the perfect start to my music career but now I must say goodbye to the app and it‚Äôs community. All of you are so talented and I really wish everyone the best in your future of music. 

I would like to thank: @xavior @HELIXX @anon86704580 @Matik @DJ_La_Rocca  @Produk @blackocean @MrSerpent @Phluze @MR_ANDERSON You have all shown so much support to me and I have really enjoyed working alongside all of you. I wish you the best 

Now by no means does this mean that I am quitting music, as DJ La Rocca put it ‚ÄúAuxy was limiting‚Äù or something along those lines. That is why I have moved towards Ableton which I am very privileged to have, and I have already started writing tracks on it.  

As my final goodbye I have released my ‚Äú8 month in the making album‚Äù, Limitations And A Bad Case Of Perfectionism (Listen here)

So then I guess that‚Äôs it from me. Thank you everyone and stay tuned! üëã

            <p>Although it would be interesting to hear if people who make the switch to a DAW like Ableton are able to develop their music and whether it leads to them actually not using Auxy anymore or whether it still works as a good song starter.</p>

            <p>We close Goodbye threads, because people kept posting them and then returning a few days later. Better to PM your mates.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you‚Äôre leaving.  Hopefully you‚Äôll pop in occasionally.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm off to listen to your album now‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm still at a bit of a loss to as why people are leaving all of a sudden. I understand they are using different DAWs beaut is that a reason to leave the community? I also understand that the forum is geared towards Auxy, but there‚Äôs no hard-and-fast rule that people have to leave after the move on from primarily using the app.</p>
