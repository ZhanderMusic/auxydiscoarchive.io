    <title>Upload To Spotify For Free?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/upload-to-spotify-for-free/12250</link>
    <description>So if you’ve been watching the news or what not, you might know that Spotify is About to be free to the Public (As in you can upload free) but you still have to have premium to listen to music. Anyway back to SoundCloud 2.0, this is a huge leap, and I’m hoping Auxy allows the option to upload to Spotify within the app. Of course we don’t have Access yet, but we will sometime I’m hoping this October!</description>

<p>Those seem primarily modelled as label partner services and promoters, rather than simply distributors.</p>
<p>A quick scan of each showed no statements about them judging whether your music was good enough.</p>
<p>If I missed it, I’m happy to take a look if you want to share some links to statements they’ve made where they, in policy or practice, have rejected music over a taste/value judgement, rather than a technical quality issue.</p>

            <p>that’s a good entry to upload, but soon I’ll be trying- and you may want to consider- using distrokid as a service</p>
<p>free is means to be skeptical</p>
<p>Amuse is looking for artists to sign, that’s their motivation<br>
Spotify wants to be a progressive platorm in effort to dominate the streaming market and get a grip on Independent musicians before other platforms do so there could be an emotional tie to a brand that believed in your capabilities</p>
<p>Those are the catches so if we are okay with that we should go for it, if not we can pay</p>
<p>Distrokid seems like a good deal and it’s affordable! no mobile app yet though, they should make one!! Mobile is the future</p>

            <p>Amuse has rejected my music before and they have no reason to post things that are not clean cut due to the fact that this service is used to find artists they see potential in. If you are not aligned with that they could decide not to post.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s true. I think you (Brandon) may be misunderstanding what these middleman services actually are. Amuse doesn’t release you under an “amuse record label”, they release you under your own Spotify (or other platform) artist account. Therefore, there’s no reason that any of these middleman services would not release your tracks for lack of quality.</p>
<p>There may be certain checks such as album art resolution etc. but these are fairly standard.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>I can see how removing a 1-3 day delay is a potential real benefit <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> …though it’s kinda negated by the delays associated with still needing to use digital distributors for all the other channels.</p>
<p>If synced multi-channel releases are important to an artist*, then they’re stuck with that delay anyway, so it kills that particular direct-to-Spotify advantage.</p>
<p>(* which they generally are, the more established you become)</p>

</aside>
<p>Not entirely. There are also crowdsourced tag and metadata contributions via Spotify’s Line In community.</p>
<p>Much of it is pulled in from sources like Gracenote or new associations built by making assumptions based on aggregated patterns of how users listen and save artists.</p>
<p>e.g. if enough users who listen to a lot of rap/hip-hop also listen to [insert new artist], then the algorithm and staff will likely initially categorise the new artist as rap/hip-hop too and potentially show them as a related artist to other hip-hop artists. It’ll fine tune the profile as more data comes in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would anyone be okay with, not Amuse, but a middleman.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the same reasons we use 3rd-party service providers in almost every other aspect of our daily lives - convenience and efficiency. Simple.</p>
<p>Do you grow all the food you eat? I’m guessing no.</p>
<p>Spotify itself could reasonably be described as a middleman, so are you ok having Spotify get between you and your listeners?</p>
<p>(Why distinguish between Amuse and a middleman? Do you not consider Amuse to be a middleman - i.e. a service)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>why not open and embrace another channel of distribution that would open up a professional looking avenue for content creators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it’s not giving me anything new, then why sacrifice convenience?</p>
<p>It’s fine if you prefer to upload to each of the hundreds of channels directly, or even just the leading ones. Until there’s an actual benefit to going direct, I’m going to stick with what’s most convenient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
To flip your question, if there’s no actual benefit to going direct, why would you not use a middleman?</p>

            <p>Tags do exist on Spotify, but they are automated, it’s for Radios and stuff, that’s how they find songs that you might like. Actually, i guess it’s not really tags if you can’t put them in or something.</p>

            <p>cool, I think the more distribution platforms to serve content to channels in different ways at different pricing/entry tiers, the better cuz we all want/need different things as artists/entreprenuers</p>

            <p>no arguement, we all have different prefences, why not open and embrace another channel of distribution that would open up a professional looking avenue for content creators</p>
<p>that is 1: free<br>
leg up Distrokid in just that way</p>
<p>2: direct &amp; presumably faster<br>
leg up on Amuse in just that way</p>
<p>that could be cool for SOME PEOPLE</p>

            <p>Monetize when you realize there’s a need not from jump, promote always though.</p>
<p>Tidal is big in the U.S.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be okay with, not Amuse, but a middleman. Who likes an additional buffer between the main services? No forum over-reading, this is Auxy Disco, not reddit. My opinion is fair.</p>

            <p>Also, not sure about Distrokid and others but Amuse lets you select countries and storefronts. So if you did want something on YouTube for some reason or whatever you can unselect it</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you feel that having direct upload access to, say, the leading 5-6 outlets, and uploading to each one directly yourself, is faster than using one distributor that fires your tracks to those 5-6 outlets - plus the dozens of others in one action?</p>
<p>Or are you advocating limited distribution, focusing solely on the leading one, maybe two, channels?</p>
<p>Either would be a hard argument to make.</p>

<p>Amuse is free, they don’t take a cut. Sure you do have to wait for release to stores.</p>
<p>I’m not looking to make a career out of this, maybe you were just speaking generally. The money I do earn I donate to cancer research. But sure, for someone who is looking to do this as a full time job I would think have other priorities in mind (promotion promotion promotion)</p>

            <p>A couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s never too early to start thinking about monetization. Even starting to go through the motions of putting your tracks on BandCamp or allowing people to stream them from Spotify is a step in the right direction. There’s honestly no need to wait until you have a big audience to start monetizing (in fact I highly do not recommend it) as releasing to other platforms is part of growing your brand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SoundCloud has a bit of a different vibe to users as it pertains somewhat to a “social media” platform for musicians (at least more than the others). Although, I have to say, I’ve personally never heard of Tidal and I don’t believe I know anybody who uses it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=6" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amuse is a distribution platform so I don’t see what’s to “not be okay” with about it. It handles the distribution to hundreds of stores for you and takes no percentage of the stream cuts. So there’s less friction in the workflow if anything.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Money shouldn’t even be discussed til you realize you have a fanbase that finds enough value in your work that they are willing to support your living making music full time. For a lot of people Spotify means access to a larger audience. Though Soundcloud is accessible, not everyone has it. Some people will only listen to the big league platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal). (Though I love Soundcloud, it still has an underground vibe which may work for some audiences still.) Bandcamp is not too common from what I know. I have no friends that use that, so it may be pretty niche? Plus amuse could be cool, but why would anyone be okay with a middleman. Money derived from music or not, any friction in the workflow of delivering music to others is not okay. Direct, faster, no middle man upload to Spotify is awesome. Do I personally use Spotify to stream? No, but I do know plenty of people who do… it’s up there with Apple Music and promoting that people listen to it on that platform looks professional.</p>

            <p>About pulse.  Yeah it’s def lacking heavily in what it can do.  But if you’re trying to delete tracks, it might be better to lock them/make them private until you can reach a computer and do it.</p>
<p>But about the tags.  Tbh, it sounds like lenberg is also dodging the fact that Auxy already uploads with the Auxy tag and used to upload with the AP # tags too.  It doesn’t seem complicated.<br>
Just add a variable and make whatever input for the variable you type in add it as a tag.  idk what the guys are using to write auxy in, but i’ve done some coding before and i dont really see how having a user created string of text would be any more complicated than the old AP tags.  Just instead of reading what AP’s were used it’s reading the user input variables.</p>
<p>On top of that, he’s saying it’s SC’s job to take care of the mobile tagging system despite the fact that they already have it and have had it for a long time (as crummy as it is), so imo, there’s really no reason to not have that implemented in auxy.</p>
<p>On top of that again, he says that it’s not important for them right now.  But i think with the new system, old regulars leaving the app and less new people randomly discovering the app, there should be more than one tag other than just Auxy to help with the app’s exposure.  The point of tagging is to potentially put tracks of similar categories with each other so you have a better chance at someone else picking it up (and hopefully taking interest in the app’s abilities).  If all the uploaded tracks just stick with only the Auxy tag, then all the tracks are kept in this very small, niche community because nothing is helping them branch out into different areas of soundcloud.</p>
<p>I dont mean any disrespect to lenberg, but it would be nice to see where they’re trying to take auxy since there hasn’t been an update in forever and they keep shooting down a lot of the things in the community has to say.</p>
