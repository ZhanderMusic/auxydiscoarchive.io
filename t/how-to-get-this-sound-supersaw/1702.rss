    <description>Hey guys at 1:26 I hear this sound a lot in EDM music, but how could that be achieved in Auxy? I&#39;m assuming something on the setting &quot;higher&quot; and a sound from &quot;The Future&quot; sound pack. I could be wrong and I could just experiment myself to find out, but I just thought I&#39;d ask anyway just in case you guys have already achieved this and can share your techniques. Thank-you!

            <p>By the way, you may want to automate the filter a bit for that kind of sound.</p>

            <p>It’s actually called a supersaw, meaning multiple detuned saw waves are layered together to create this ‘huge’ effect. It’s used in a bunch of house and future bass tracks, and varies song to song on the degree of the saws being detuned.<br>
You can replicate this sound by using the Fragment synth from Vivrant’s soundpack and Silk from 7 Skies’s soundpack.</p>

            <p>Hey guys at 1:26 I hear this sound a lot in EDM music, but how could that be achieved in Auxy? I’m assuming something on the setting “higher” and a sound from “The Future” sound pack. I could be wrong and I could just experiment myself to find out, but I just thought I’d ask anyway just in case you guys have already achieved this and can share your techniques. Thank-you!</p>
