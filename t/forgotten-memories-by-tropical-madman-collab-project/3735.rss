    <description>I have put together a song that I really need help with. Iâ€™ve been working on this project  and the song sounds amazing. Iâ€™ve put a few instruments ðŸŽº but need help. If you would like to edit and add more instruments that I donâ€™t have (AP 1,4,5,6 and 7) you may put a choice of your like. And help me work this out. All editors will be put in the description below. (I have no idea if Iâ€™m making a challenge ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ god I hope not) thanks.
