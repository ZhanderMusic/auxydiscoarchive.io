            <p>Irregularity now stands at the top of my songs, with over 1000 plays, and I sort of get it. According to the comments, the key change is hype. However, it’s the last future bass song i’ve made in forever, so my favorite at the moment is wasteland</p>

            <p>My song At Dawn was probably successful for the vibes. The tone of the song really fits the genre and plenty of dedication to the creativity of the project shows throughout the song. In my perspective, I think people thought it was an underrated song and many people reposted it. Really happy how the song turned out.<br>

            <p>For awhile, Retrowave was the top track for me, probably because of the trend of 80s having a comeback ever since Stranger Things became popular.</p>
<p>However, back in March, Five Fragments of a Fox became the most popular track for me by a long shot, most likely because of the fact that the devs reposted this on their SoundCloud.</p>
<p>Both of these songs did have progression in it; Retrowave went from a simple drumbeat to drum and bass, FFoaF had chiptune, trance-inspired rhythms, and a pitch change.</p>
<p>If I had to choose which ones were my favorite, the answer would be none of them. If i’m being honest, I hate hearing FFoaF because it sounded too close to a basic indie-game soundtrack, something I struggle to avoid. I hated Retrowave because is was popularized by trends.</p>

            <p>Heatwave or Lights That Dim, They both have very epic final drops, one is trance and one is sad, so you can choose. I also thought Hybrid was pretty good because it is quiet and uses different mixing styles. Link for heatwave is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gangster-000/heatwave" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and lights that dim is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gangster-000/lights-that-dim-v1-1" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. If you want to hear Hybrid, then click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gangster-000/hybrid" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. My other most successful one is Lights That <em>Shine</em>.

            <p>My top track was one with me and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fokkses">@Fokkses</a> called Remember. I couldn’t link it if I wanted to, but you can look up Fokkses’ SoundCloud and find it there.</p>
<p>I think it was most successful because I did a collab on it, and with my luck, I was working with one of the greatest artists on this app at that time. I feel if I did a collab again, I’d be much smarter and I could actually help along the way instead of making up my mind on what others did to my work.</p>

            <p>My only top track was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/winter_j_studios/dreams-tropical-original" rel="nofollow noopener">Dreams</a>.</p>
<p>A few people said they liked the melody and chord progression. I just kinda gave it a big ol’ thumbs up and said dope.</p>

<p>Unsure why. It’s certainly not my favorite. But hey! That’s how it usually seems to go.</p>

            <p>my remix of Interstellar, I don’t know why it was successful in the first place. There are much better tracks made by me, but why do people like this one?<br>

            <p>yeah I guess that makes sense</p>
<p>don’t see how I was criticizing your music though…</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blakkaz">@blakkaz</a> based on that statistic he got more than average exposure on the song so I guess I was wrong</p>

<p>it surprises me that you still find new ways to criticize my music🤷🏻‍♂️ but honestly since their main focuses are their youtube channel and their spotify page, the majority of their soundcloud followers aren’t extremely active. and most of the people that saw it on youtube probably wouldn’t go search for my soundcloud and listen there when they could just as easily play the youtube version.</p>

            <p>update: rotation is my first Auxy song to reach 1K plays on soundcloud<br>
I know that’s not very much but none of the stuff on my main page has very many plays haha</p>
<p>also, I had a non-auxy release fairly recently that’s currently at 5.3K<br>
my stats have definitely increased a lot since the start of 2019, which is a nice feeling</p>

            <p>Mine was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/crystldawn/breeze" rel="nofollow noopener">breeze.</a> I think its success was partly based on it being included in the Auxy House Music compilation (remember that?) and also because it was a pretty good track, if I do say so myself.</p>
