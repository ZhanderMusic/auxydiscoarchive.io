    <title>Who Wants Male Vocals?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/who-wants-male-vocals/12493</link>
    <description>I’m going to be singing vocals for the people on the list below. These people are excused from paying for vocals, and get 1 song for vocals/lyrics. This is because they asked before I started charging. Now, I know that most of you are not the richest people in the world, so the price is low. 

Vocals - $2
Singing Lyrics - $1
Rap Lyrics - $2 (I won’t rap on your track though)
Vocals &amp; Singing Lyrics - $2.50

The exempt people are as follows

@aerodynamyk
@MrSerpent
@KDS_Official
@aUstin_Haga
@NorthEast
@Coral
@HELIXX
Nathan Eclipse

DM me for some vox guys. Need an example of my singing? https://soundcloud.com/xtrk/feat-hexx-olde-timey</description>
