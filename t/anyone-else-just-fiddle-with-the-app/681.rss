    <title>Anyone else just fiddle with the app?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-else-just-fiddle-with-the-app/681</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had Auxy for like 2 months now I think.

I have like 40+ &#39;tracks&#39; but no songs. I&#39;m fiddling with all the sound packs, making soundscapes, testing beat-making, etc.

Just curious if there&#39;s anyone else out there who isn&#39;t making songs either but having a blast with the app :)</description>

            <p>Same! Just playing around a lot, maybe take music on professionally at some point, but yeah, Auxy is an amazing platform for aspiring producers, hobbyists, pretty much anyone who loves and wants to make music <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>That’s me exactly! I don’t have full songs, just playing around with the app (I love how Auxy makes everything so accessible.)</p>

            <p>In the old version of the app I just used it for making notes and projects I’d export and use somewhere else. but this version I’ve only used it for about 2 days now and already made a full? song each day. I love it. :V</p>

            <p>Oh no, I mean like I really don’t have much of anything made haha.</p>
<p>I know ‘what’ makes a song, but I don’t have in-depth understanding/experience of Chord Progressions, or making melodies, or even simple drum beats.</p>
<p>Really I’ve just made a bunch of individual sounds, and that’s it. I haven’t played with the scenes yet to consider anything close to being a song yet.</p>
<p>But, I have a few sounds/beats I do like so far, so let me get those in a track and you can play with em <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>e: here’s actually something useful. I think I stole the chords from a YouTube video, but the beat is mine <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/vGAnqGcVTGnPhSlW1iTAtg==" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/vGAnqGcVTGnPhSlW1iTAtg==</a></p>
