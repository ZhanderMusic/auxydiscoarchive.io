    <description>Post your links to your Hip-Hop (or hip-hop “inspired”) tracks below and I’ll listen and give some feedback. I’ll listen and give feedback to each one. This is by far my favorite genre so I’m interested to hear what you have.</description>

            <p>Nice. I would say there are a few things that you could improve in this song. There is a little shaker sound that is annoying cuz it’s just thrown in in like the 2nd bar (if I remember correctly). Also the drums get repetitive. Lastly, the track sounded “empty” at some points. Overall very nice song, can’t wait to hear more from you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hey guys, I am brand new to the forum and Auxy community all together.  I have just recently gotten into producing music as a hobby.  I don’t have any real experience with playing instruments or music theory, so I thought I would give this app a try.  Here is a link to a track that I recently uploaded to sound cloud and I would really appreciate some honest feedback to better improve myself!  I would say it has hints of trap, hip hop, and EDM.</p>

            <p>Did you make cornbread in Auxy? How did you get the whistling kinda sound if you did. Love the jazzy vibes and the pianos. Winter Dreams was very nice to listen to, it had a nice flow too it. Everything was very smooth. Melodically very nice. I don’t really have any negatives.

            <p>Pretty good track. A tad Too fast for its style to be completely honest. And I think something messed up with PUNCH. It sounds distorted in some areas unless u have stacked too many layers? Although I actually listened to all of it and quite enjoyed it</p>

            <p>I really appreciate your feedback. The song isn’t actually finished. I haven’t worked on the structure at all. It was just sort of an experement that was inspired by a Hip-Hop song I heard. I will definately work on the points you mentioned. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I’m gonna be completely honest, I didn’t like it that much. It didn’t sound very trap or hip hop to me (except for maybe the 808s). It was missing a lot of drums, which I consider a huge part of hip hop. And the rolling snares sounded more EDM ish than hip hop. Obviously not everything is gonna be perfect but idk if I would listen again. Also, (Not to be too harsh) the song structure would’ve done better (I feel) if there was more of a build up. You kicked it in right away with the 808s and didn’t really build it that much intro wise. I think it has potential, but maybe not as a hip hop/ trap song</p>
