Can this style of bass be made in Auxy? If so what synths would you recommend to produce it?</description>

<p>On the last version of Auxy, the drum kit dust had the special automation Dist, which allowed you to distort the sounds. If this could be added into more drums/basses/synths…this would be AMAZINGGG!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It was originally called “Tone” for the drum kits, only with 5 was it relabeled as Dist. As for why it was removed, who knows. Maybe they didn’t want to worry about things not playing nice with it.</p>
<p>As for the leads/basses, many of them have distortion built in or include them on their sliders. It’s 100% inconsistent though, and some instruments have different types of distortion. It would be hard to implement something that would work for everything since some require it at a certain setting to function as they are currently.</p>

            <p>Some synths “tone” is used to distort. But yeah, would be cool I guess. Not an automation tho. As an actually effect would be better. And then obviously itd come with an automation slot</p>

            <p>Indeed…,</p>
<p>Actually <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> this is a great suggestion! A distortion automation would help open up so many new possibilities! Being able to distort basses and synths would certainly help out those who love to make chiptune/chiptrap!</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>On the last version of Auxy, the drum kit dust had the special automation Dist, which allowed you to distort the sounds. If this could be added into more drums/basses/synths…this would be AMAZINGGG!</p>

            <p>It’s a shame you can’t add distortion to your bass in Auxy. Make it really crunchy and have a deeper growl.</p>

            <p>The bass “puma” With the lowpass down can make a growly bass somewhat like this. Also “bee” Can make some pretty cool sounds If you mess around with it allot (If you get stung, don’t blame me)</p>
<p>Other than that I have no clue what could make that type of bass.</p>
