    <title>Alternative - Tropical Original</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/alternative-tropical-original/3998</link>
    <description>Here’a a new track made today. Taking the chances I have now. I should be able to get better at making music soon. I have to get more Sound packs. It will probably be awhile before you all hear different sounds. I am broke on cash and I’m trying to get some money. See you all soon and enjoy my new track.

            <p>Really enjoyed this, that melody is haunting. Excellent choice of sounds they really complement each other very well!</p>
