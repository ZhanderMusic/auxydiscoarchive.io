    <title>Cheddr - Cheddr [Album]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/cheddr-cheddr-album/19723</link>
    <description>Wow, Auxy has come a long way (and so have I tbh)
I released this 12 track album on various platforms in the last several months.

Just uploaded it to Soundcloud.
https://soundcloud.com/cheddr/sets/cheddr


Best sound quality is on Bandcamp http://cheddr.bandcamp.com or Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeMbqbkLYvfo8fviHtU96GA
Purchase it at bandcamp if you are so inclined, no pressure. Heck contact me and I&#39;ll give you a download code if you like.

Track 1 has amazing vocals by Austin, TX team Eric C. Powell and Andrea Powell (https://ecpmusic.cc/). Vocals recorded and mixed external to Auxy. Otherwise all tracks were 100% produced with Auxy. 

It took me over a year to produce these songs to the point where I was satisfied. If I exported this to Midi, there would be 60-70,000 notes in this album. Crazy to think about it that way. This is no, on session beats album. I put my heart and soul in it.

*Track list*
I&#39;m on My Way (feat Eric C. Powell and Andrea Powell)
Stone Cold
Signals and Shadows
Letters from Camp Pt 1
Letters from Camp Pt 2
Center City
Thirty Six Oh Five
Half Moon
A-Town
Alleys and Allies
Sky Blue Pink
I&#39;m on My Way (Album Instrumental)

Some day I&#39;ll tell the stories about these song titles. lol.
