    <title>I need help with chords/basics</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-need-help-with-chords-basics/1054</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been using Auxy for about 9 months now, but I&#39;ve never been able to make good chord progressions. However, since I&#39;m a big fan of progressive house, I really want to be able to make good chord progressions. Therefore I started looking online for the basic music theory. I&#39;ve found several guides for beginners, but when reading those guides I still haven&#39;t got a clue what they&#39;re talking about. Therefore I came to the conclusion that my knowledge and understanding of the theory behind music is ZERO. Do you guys perhaps have any tips or websites to help me get started? I would really appreciate it :)</description>

            <p>It really depends on what kind of music you are trying to make, my “go to” chords will be: first note the bass line, skip a white note and put another one, skip another and put one there too (going up). Keep adding to it and change the chord structure for different sounds!</p>
