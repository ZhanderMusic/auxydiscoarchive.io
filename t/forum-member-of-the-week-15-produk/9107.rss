&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #15: @Produk   &lt;/big&gt;   :duck: 
 :duck: 
&lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt;roduk (Previously &quot;Captain&quot;) lives in Minnesoda USA and is a professor of **Wubs**. He&#39;s well-known around these parts for his **Future Bass**  &amp; his extensive campaign against an important social issue: - excessive forum poll usage.  

His popular track [Singularity](https://soundcloud.com/produkmusic/singularity) has 10k+ plays  &amp; he was a finalist in the Auxy Forum Awards (2017) for both Best Auxy Producer &amp; Most Supportive Forum Member. His tracks have been featured by Auxy. He won a [Unicorn](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-unicorn-hall-of-fame/5411) for producing Auxy tutorial videos. And three more things:  His self deprecating roast-me thread was highly entertaining. He&#39;s engaged in a few Rap Battles. And he appears to prefer using one-word song titles.

            <p>Hey Produk,</p>
<p>You’re a real personality within the Auxy Forum and your music is always positively received.</p>
<p>One of your strengths is strong layering and mixing. Your layers are all super distinct and clear, never muddy.  Sounds aren’t lost in your tracks. In particular, the drums always sound great, really punchy. And your leads shine through despite the thick pads that are characteristic of your sound.  Strong layering and quality mixing are key skills of the better producers and you’re totally nailing it.</p>
<p>I love your recent piano work, like the leads in Urgency / Memories and the piano chords in Distant Future. Also enjoyed the the unique introduction for Vision  And pretty much everything about Meteor.</p>
<p>The only constructive feedback I can offer is that your tracks often rely on a) wubs, b) stammering effects and c)  build / drops with automation.   You’re super good at these three things - and people admire you for it, including myself - but despite the high quality of your work, it can start to feel predictable. Like, I know you’re going to do those three things. Distant Future is awesome and then it returns to the safety net of wubs;  Magnetism has unique and innovative sections, but returns to stammering. These three techniques are repeated across your tracks pretty consistently. Your music and inspiration could possibly benefit from purposely NOT using those three techniques for a few tracks. I’d be keen to hear that, for sure.</p>
<p>But, even without any changes, your music is already awesome!</p>

            <p>Nice new track btw! The trap beat is on point. I think it sounds a little empty in the beginning, but it sounds awesome in the end. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

<p>Sorry if my feedback got a little less detailed as the tracks went on. My overall enjoyment of the tracks led me to get more lost in the tracks, leading me to not have as much to say about some of the tracks. Since rebranding as Produk, you’ve definitely improved your style quite a lot. I can’t wait to listen more in the future, something I keep putting off for some reason.</p>

            <p>As I started listening to your older tracks, you just post a whole new track :0</p>
<p>Fractals: I really like this one! It’s a really nice departure from your traditional sound that I think you desperately needed. It really works quite well. The mixture of your style inside of a slowed down relaxed hip-hop beat really works quite well.</p>

            <p>I love your newer tracks! Right now, I’d say Memories is my favorite. The piano is well composed, and the Progressive House vibes about 1/3 or the way into the song are perfect. I absolutely love little plucks like that. The chords are perfect too. You’re always able to make your stuff sound really rich and wide! It’s great!</p>

I remember you saying a few months ago that you weren’t able to make anything that you like anymore, lack of creativity. Well, when listening to your tracks, this hasn’t caused a decrease in quality or creativity whatsoever. I’m not a huge fan of future bass, but your stuff is quality man. Also your non-fb tracks are really good, so you are a really versatile producer. I especially like the more uptempo stuff with phat chord progressions, such as your tracks Meteor and Burden. Awesome work man, keep it up!</p>

            <p>Ok.</p>
<p>Urgency has such an atmospheric feel. I love the light use of tonsil in the beginning. The chords are really relaxing as well. And that buildup is really awesome. The drop is pretty cool. The use of tonsil again is awesome. And those drums! I am horrible at using drums which go well together and I am even worse at fills. That recovery is perfect. Just after the drop I could hear the hour, but that isn’t bad because I love hour <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:">. I don’t like the second build as much as the first because the pitch increase doesn’t really go well with the song, but it is still amazing and professional. That second drop is AMAZING :0 I love the ride symbol use. The impact afterwards is very good. I love the tonsil like before. As it was planning out, I kinda heard June or something similar layered with the tonsil? Was that just me or is that how the tonsil sounds when it pans out. Anyway, love it. The piano is also beautiful. Great song!</p>
<p>Your remix of still growing up is so professional sounding! Those vocals at the begging sound awesome. And those first chords are heavy and amazing! The vocals are really awesome! I haven’t ever heard still growing up by 3 string band so are those te vocals in the actual song or is it you? I like the riser in the background for the build. And that drop is amazing!! I love the parts when the chords just cut out for parts. Sometimes when they cut out it can feel a bit off though. Anyway, amazing drop! The vocals felt a bit off in places, but that song was absolutely amazing! Much better than I could do btw.</p>
<p>When I heard the intro of meteor I thought the whole song would be pitched like that, but that was the PERFECT intro for the beauty that followed next. (Love the cover art btw). The chords are beautiful, as is the melody. The riser I have heard in a few of your other songs. I really like it. That first drop is awesome! The use of tonsil again is perfect. I see you have started not using wubs every song and I like it! This is an awesome song. I like the small details, like the main drums cutting out for the clap in the second build. The second drop is very cool. I forgot to point this out on the first drop, but those drums are sensational! Especially the SUPER FAST fill! The ride is a great addition to the song. The tonsil is awesome like usual. The pan out is awesome, I love the bass and the ending when the tonsil volume goes up is really cool. A great track!</p>
<p>The pitched intro again, but again it fits right in. In Burden I love the use of he vintage keys. The riser is awesome like usual. And the use of I think it’s silk in the build is really creative. The piano is beautiful. And that drop!!! AMAZING. 20/10. The chords are emotional and beautiful. And the use of hour in the second half is also amazing. The impact pan out is great. The bridge (I think it’s called a bridge I’m a noob at this kind of stuff) is awesome. Did you use tonsil for the melody layering with the piano or is another instrument? I like it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:">. The build is again awesome and… YEAHHHHHHH!!! That drop slapped me in the face again. And in a good way. I love the little pops as well. The ride and hour is also amazing. My favourite so far.</p>
<p>Yessssss. Distant Future! My favourite of yours. I’ve seen people calling it “dry” in places but to me it’s perfect! That intro is amazing. And the chords are BEAUTIFUL! The melodies go perfectly and the build is so professional. AND THE DROP IS AWESOME YEAHH. Even the drums are top notch. The chords are beautiful and those w u b a are so smooth! The recovery is awesome, and that (bridge?) is awesome. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=5" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:"> . The piano goes right with the song. The way you pitched it makes it sound like a high strong instrument. Love it. The second build is awesome again. The break between the build and drop is a nice addition and THAT DROP IS AWESOME AGAIN!! I wish it went on for longer! The pan out is very nice. 20/10 again. My favourite so far.</p>
<p>Memories. That is such a beautiful name. Just like the chords! This song is going to make me cry it is so emotional. The piano is just… sensational. And the percussion goes right with the song. The use of I think it’s igloo but it could be from destiny is awesome. As is the melody it’s playing. The build is awesome, and that drop is so cool. Goes right with the song. Beautiful. Awesome drums, awesome song. The piano comes on a little abruptly imo but not too much of an issue. The drums are just so awesome! The second build is awesome again, and I love the build to drop breaks btw! They are creatively awesome. The use of the melodic percussion fits right in. The ending is amazing. Loved that song. So emotion sparking and beautiful.</p>
<p>Sorry I didn’t give that much feedback this week. I couldn’t have done it this weekend so I did it Friday and I have school soon so I couldn’t give too much. Distant future was my favourite. You are one of the auxy wonders. Such an amazing artist. Your songs are all so atmospherical! Keep it up. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Oh, it’s the Duk. You really need to remix something from DuckTales or TaleSpin. Seriously. Not just for the puns galore, I’m sure you’d breathe new life into them.</p>

            <p>I like your music and I’m probably your top listener on Spotify <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Magnetism is probably my favorite, I like how you combined different techniques wubs with other future bass stuff to make a pretty awesome track.</p>
<p>Rest is really cool because it doesn’t contain any wubs and is a bit of a different genre for you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback! Remember, Twitch is the drumkit <em>from</em> Memories, Memories is not a song that just uses Twitch. Memories was the Twitch before Twitch was a thing. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Where do I begin? I’ll start at ‘Burden’, the intro is fun and the electric pianos are also cool. The melody couldn’t have been better, especially the arp chords. The drop honestly isn’t my favorite, it would have been nice if the Hour at the end resolved itself. The second verse and drop is even better than the first, I really love what you do with the impacts and percussion. Overall, a great song.</p>
<p>‘Memories’ is one of my favorites that you made. The piano is simply amazing. I love how you used Twitch for the drums, but I don’t know how well the kick fits in. Could I how you did the second set of plucks in the build, the ones that sound a bit like Jelly? I’m a fan of those. I like how you sneakily added in some Melodic Percussion here and there, it gives great variety.</p>
<p>‘Rest’ is a <em>really</em>  good one. With the percussion (and this was before Auxy 5, bear in mind), the chords and the little arps, you made something really unique. Add that to the Silo and bird sfx, and you’ve got another awesome song.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> the chords in ‘Progeny’, as well as the sweeper. The piano is also a great touch. Only one question…why isn’t MR. A in the title?</p>
<p>In addition to your amazing music, your album artwork is also amazing! Somehow you manage to make it very well-balanced color-wised, instead of too flashy or too dull. I can never get that right.</p>
<p>Congratulations on being Forum Member of the Week!</p>
