    <title>What kind of sound packs would you like to see in the future?</title>

    <description>Let us know what you wish for! It&#39;s quite complicated to make a sound pack though so don&#39;t expect us to just drop the pack you&#39;re wishing for next week. It&#39;s especially tricky to make packs with well-known producers, since most people you know of are super busy and not even possible to get a hold of. We&#39;re trying out best though.</description>

            <p>make sure more sounds have different types of distortions and different values for distortion, delay, and reverb as a default. all new sounds have very similar, if not the same effect settings by default</p>

            <p><strong>Vintage Keys 2</strong> (with proper phaser and vibrato controls)<br>
— more Rhodes, with character (ref:`<a href="https://youtu.be/dKCEuQUmjvo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">J3PO’s preset pack for Addictive Keys Mark One</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Retro analog leads</strong> (with proper Decay controls  — and a bloomin’ mono <em>option</em>)<br>
— bunch of Moog stuff would be great</p>
<p><strong>Pianos 2</strong><br>
— incl. Felt pianos, prepared pianos, …</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>No more sound fx, glitches, drums or percussion. Those things are easy to source elsewhere - and the kit library is already unmanageably large.</p>
<p>Oh, and definitely no more bottom-of-the-barrel packs “from Mars” (especially when the better sounds aren’t included).</p>
<p>The ‘from Mars’ offerings actually include some quality retro synth samples. Shame Auxy will only license miserly sub-selections from the absolute cheapest stuff.</p>

            <p>I assume you mean heavy metal guitars, in that case I strongly agree. Dedicated metal/electric/rock guitars would be a great addition in my opinion and has been requested multiple times. I’m not sure about a Lofi drum kit as we already have a few kits/packs that will do the job very easily, namely most of the Mars kits/packs.</p>

            <p>Imo, I don’t see any reason for auxy to add a LoFi drum kit seeing as its super easy to import to LoFi sounds and make your own drum kit. At least that’s what I do.</p>

            <p>oh ok makes sense. i guess it would be better to give more noun names to drum kits with mixed samples such as appetite and shell. but i wonder why the drum kit from the sound of vivrant is called “globe” and not “vivrant”</p>

            <p>I’m inclined to disagree there.<br>
Those packs refer to sounds that exist out there in the wild, and are often more widely known than Auxy.</p>
<p>People will most likely want to look for them and find them by name, so renaming them to something bespoke just makes them harder to find — and actually reduces the appeal of Auxy and/or the pack bc ppl may not realise they’re available.</p>
<p>After all, you wouldn’t rename a saxophone instrument to something completely unrelated, would you?</p>

            <p>and another thing: i want new drum kits to be named in the same way as melodic instruments, like with nouns, adjectives, etc. rather than the names of the sound packs they came from because it feels boring imo. for example, a drum kit from SDS800 from mars shouldn’t be called SDS800, but maybe a noun</p>

            <p>Yes! I100% agree with this! That was big missed opportunity indeed. But now that you mention it, I just checked the news feed and they didn’t have a specific 6.8 or 6.7 post. I see the language post and 6.6 post but it seems like news and information for Auxy has fallen off quite a bit lately.</p>

            <p>i think something that was a missed opportunity was that when the 6.8 update introduced new languages, there should’ve been like one or two ethnic sound packs</p>

            <p>Importing is an ok option, but usually means a limited octave range for the usable notes. Go too high or too low and things quickly start to chipmunks or dragged.</p>
<p>It can help when bringing in sounds that Auxy will likely never be able create, but I t’s not really a scalable alternative to properly created sounds based on the internal synth engine.</p>
