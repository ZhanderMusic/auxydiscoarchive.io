    <title>What do you think about time length limitation for BTC?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-do-you-think-about-time-length-limitation-for-btc/4297</link>
    <description>I’ve been participating many BTC and noticed that some selected tracks are longer than suggested time length. 
Ex: suggested length... 45 sec,
      selected song... over 1 min.

I was wondering at first but this occasionally happens also in ~#13 BTC(which developers hosted) so I’m kinda used to it.
However, I know some users do care or think seriously about this limitation as I found many questions like “is ~second ok?”or “is ~ sec over allowed?” in every BTC threads.

I don’t want to accuse any previous hosts, as they all kindly replied to many questions, but I would be glad if the comments in this thread helped making better BTC that everyone feels happy.

Please leave your honest opinion.</description>

            <p>Huh. I guess somehow I thought otzsil’s was longer. I was a little attention-hungry back then, anyway. Those days are in the past</p>

Thanks for the comments from the perspective of hosts.<br>
That point (set the limitation to make BTC manageable) is very reasonable and I can totally agree on that.<br>
Maybe this idea was not known for some people including me so, great to hear from you.</p>

<p>The “winning” track was ca 1.09 (even though there was a bit of a tail at the end), and I think the time limit was 1 minute. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Regardless, the time limit is just there to make it manageable for the person to go through submissions. So if the track is too long, it won’t be judged on the part that is beyond the limit.</p>

            <p>If I was hosting I’d be 100% strict. Say the limit was 1 minute… “My track’s 1 second too long, is that okay?” “Nope.” “My song finishes at 1:00 but the reverb takes it over the limit. Is that okay?” “Nope.”</p>
<p>Partly because I personally feel like the time limit introduces a HUGE musical challenge, which is half of the point, and partly because other people will have had to make compromises on their songs in order to meet the rules. It’s unfair to them to allow songs that haven’t strictly followed the rules.</p>
<p>A certain track might very well sound awesome, but if it’s not within the rules then it doesn’t belong on the shortlist imo. Otherwise why have the rules.</p>
<p>That’s my opinion, but I think it makes sense to leave it up to each individual host to decide for themselves.</p>

            <p>Yeah I remember the BTC that Mr. Anderson is talking about and feeling a little frustrated about that as well. However, If the host clearly says it’s ok to go over then I think it’s ok.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the whole point of the time limit is so that the hosts don’t have to spend forever listening to a ton of full-length songs. There may have been somewhere around 150 submissions for the last BTC which is like around 2 1/2 hours straight up listening to the tracks, and a lot of them I listened to more than once. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> But if most of the people stay around 45 seconds it keeps it from getting even more out of hand.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think going over necessarily gives a huge advantage. Of course I listened entirely through all the submissions, but usually you can have a general idea if something is going to have a shot at making the shortlist in the first 15 seconds or so.</p>
<p>Hope this gives a little insight, and I’m totally fine if future hosts won’t to be more strict about the time limit. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> These were just my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Thanks for inspirational talks.<br>
It looks like the message for ME so I will reply and share some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, i won’t give up. It’s more like having fun, spending quality time than “challenging” so, I will keep having good time. I admit doing self mockery, that’s also for fun. I want to and I will stop this by making good track.</p>
<p>Another point is, I’m not sure I will end up choosing the track over limit. I’m ok with other hosts choosing the track like that, I understand that’s their choice, and that’s how BTC is. However I personally think manage to make tracks in certain limitation is very respectful ability as musicians. As submitting to some musical contests for commercial use, we do need to summarize the track in certain time length and that’d need a huge dedication. So in that sense, if I were a host, I want to value more their effort when they make track with suggested time length.<br>
That’s my personal opinion. Hope you understand.</p>

            <p>I felt the exact same way in beat the clock twelve. I placed on the list, but the winner of that one had an entry WAY over the time limit. I felt that it was kind of unfair to those of us who followed the rules, that someone who disregarded them won. Trust me, I’ve been in your place before. But what you have to remember, is that the host of the beat the clock can choose whoever they want. It’s their choice, since they hosted it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remember that, someday, when YOU are hosting a beat the clock, you will probably end up picking that person with the great entry that was over the time limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you grow in your musical ability, you will probably  place on a beat the clock list. Just give it time, patience, and a lot of hard work. Don’t give up because you fail, but get up and succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t get caught up ONLY in the attention you get as a music artist. If all you care about in music is people liking you for it, then you aren’t a true musician to begin with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope some of this help! You are not the only person out there who has experienced this thought sometime or another.</p>

            <p>They have to listen to hundreds and hundreds of tracks over the weekend, and they have busy lives. If people make shorter tracks it requires less time for the hosts. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I do agree that many songs were not strictly following the time limit in recent BTC’s, it’s always a gamble if the host will accept or not past their limit. I do think a greater emphasis does need to be placed on the timing for certain.</p>

            <p>I’ve been participating many BTC and noticed that some selected tracks are longer than suggested time length.<br>
Ex: suggested length… 45 sec,<br>
selected song… over 1 min.</p>
<p>I was wondering at first but this occasionally happens also in ~#13 BTC(which developers hosted) so I’m kinda used to it.<br>
However, I know some users do care or think seriously about this limitation as I found many questions like “is ~second ok?”or “is ~ sec over allowed?” in every BTC threads.</p>
<p>I don’t want to accuse any previous hosts, as they all kindly replied to many questions, but I would be glad if the comments in this thread helped making better BTC that everyone feels happy.</p>
<p>Please leave your honest opinion.</p>
