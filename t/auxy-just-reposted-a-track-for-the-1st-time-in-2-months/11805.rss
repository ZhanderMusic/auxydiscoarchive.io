    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-just-reposted-a-track-for-the-1st-time-in-2-months/11805</link>
    <description>About 18 minutes ago, the auxy SoundCloud account reposted a track called &quot;Without&quot; by Unfound. Could this mean the end of a drought?</description>

            <p>Wow, just saw that large amount of likes. I’m sure it’s been mentioned before but my guess is that the Auxy team saw a track made in Auxy that had a lot of likes and support and was a great song, and reposted it to their account so their followers (and others) would know it was made on Auxy and then they could consider getting the app.</p>

            <p>Maybe. Who knows, there could be better ways of getting your tracks reposted… but honestly I’d just try to make friends with those who could help promote you to more of the userbase. Repost trades with bigger producers will help you get noticed.</p>

            <p>Yeah that’s a good point. I feel like this is the time to release your best tracks in hope of getting reposted, and if you do, hoping it’s close enough to the top for people to actually see and put in the time to play. At this point, only time will tell, and let’s just hope for the best!</p>

            <p>Already mentioned this, it’s not like they haven’t done this before. Although those featured in the last repost run are now enjoying almost 2+k plays because of the songs being the last reposted songs… who knows? Maybe now the new thing is to be the last person Auxy reposts before the next month-plus hiatus, instead of actually getting reposted?</p>

            <p>Hopefully they don’t repost like 16 million songs and reward each song with 3 plays</p>

            <p>Thanks, I’ve tried tons of tutorials but I just don’t really feel like I’m always getting it :\ either way it doesn’t fit with either of the two profiles I currently work for and right now I’m not comfortable investing in a third one, unlike <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> who has four xD</p>

            <p>Ah ok I see what you mean. Also, about synthwave, here’s a great video that I found about it on YouTube:<br>

<p>but in that case, why would the auxy team repost something on (what I would assume) an account that represents their company, if it wasn’t actually made in the app?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Who knows? Then again, how did Auxy even find the track? It’s not tagged as <span class="hashtag">#Auxy</span>, which is how Lenberg specifically said he looks for tracks to repost.</p>
<p>I do have some theories though…</p>
<p>The things I could think of is to show how “auxy” made a popular huge song, but that may be not 100% true. I’m trying to get into contact with him/him to ask what he used, not just for this but because I would like to ask about techniques for that style. I still don’t get Synthwave at all xD</p>
