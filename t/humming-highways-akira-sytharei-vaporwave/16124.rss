    <title>Humming Highways - Akira Sytharei [Vaporwave]</title>

    <description>[Humming Highways SoundCloud link](https://soundcloud.com/akirasytharei/humming-highways)

So I finally return, an unknown user (or forgotten) arising from the depths of hiatus. I have travelled the seven seas just to arrive at one country known as Animeland (Japan) and had an infinite way ticket back, as long as my internet is alive. I decided to take another shot at Vaporwave, a genre that’s still alive today (unsurprisingly). I slowed down the actual track that was rendered and used some sound effects, slapping them together in Audacity and was surprised by the end result. 

P.S.: Refer to me as Akira or Aki, since I’ve decided to change and finalize my artist name.</description>
