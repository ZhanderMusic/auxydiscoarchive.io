            <p>Don’t make them too cluttered just cause you wanna use all the sounds. Make them simple, but effective. Don’t go too crazy on hi-hat rhythms. Don’t use ducker w/ kick when you have lots of kicks close together.</p>

            <p>Start with a kick. Make it match the track you’re writing. If it’s a dancy track, you’re gonna want something a little punchy. If it’s a hip hop style beat, or alternative, something a little dry-er.</p>
<p>Find a snare that compliments the kick. This is pretty important.</p>
<p>Now, select percussive sounds that sound good with your kick and snare. This could be anything from different kinds of toms, or maybe another snare, if you’re writing something very electronic it could be clicks and beeps. There’s plenty of these sounds in the available samples.</p>
<p>DON’T be afraid to mess with pitch on samples. They sound great, but sometimes pitching up or down a weird little percussive element makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Your kick and snare should drive the beat, but pepper in the percussive elements on off notes. Fill in the blank spaces.</p>
<p>That’s about the best advice I have… experimentation is key. Break out of the kick snare kick snare paradigm (not saying you do that, but, beat wise, there’s SO much that can be done)</p>

            <p>If you are having trouble, try starting off with a kick snare pattern every 1 beat, then build off of that. You shouldn’t do this unless you can do nothing else. Usually I feel the beat, and try to recreate what I felt in my head.</p>

            <p>I program drums like I do melodies, so I think of it as a melody where instead of different notes I have different percussion sounds. So I don’t typically do it like laying down kicks and/or snares and then hi hats, etc.  I do all the sounds (that I want to use) at once and listen for the flow like you would a melody.  This way of looking at it really helped me get over my drum difficulties, not perfect now, but better off than before.</p>
<p>The drums in my track “Big” were programmed with this in mind.  Not that it’s the best song ever, but you can hear a sort of melodic little percussion motif at the intro and end.</p>
