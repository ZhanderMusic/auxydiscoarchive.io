    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-dont-know-what-sub-genre-of-edm-i-am-doing/13202</link>
    <description>Any time i come up with a song without getting inspiration from other songs(which is what i do most of the time).I just dont have any idea what sub-genre of edm it is so i still dont know what is my main genre in production.Is this normal? lol

And can you guys help me determine what genre these songs are?

2) https://soundcloud.com/user-123297002/time-is-running-out

4) https://soundcloud.com/user-123297002/time-shift

5) https://soundcloud.com/user-123297002/event-horizon

6) https://soundcloud.com/user-123297002/paradise-sets
