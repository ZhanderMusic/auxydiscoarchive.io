            <p>My first username was PoshFOX, which was taken by many people so I had to change. The name split between ‚ÄúPosho‚Äù and ‚ÄúFokkses‚Äù, and I used the first for a month before sticking to ‚ÄúFokkses‚Äù.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs quite a weird story tbh, I got a sunburn a couple years ago while I had sunglasses on, so I looked like a panda around my eyes, but with the wrong colours (bright around my eyes and dark everywhere else). So my dad said I looked like an inverse panda, then when I had to come up with an artist name I just changed it to inverse because inverse panda sounds horrible imo.</p>

            <p>My story is so weird lol so;<br>
When i was 8  (12 years ago) a friend of my brothers and him played a online mafia game.<br>
After a while  his friend quit and my brother told me i could have his account. His name was lander so he made his username landy. I really loved the sound of it so i kept it and added 005 as in 007 ( a game i played on xbox, and 5 because it was my lucky number).</p>

            <p>I got my name from an old account I had on this website called Scratch. It‚Äôs a coding-for-beginners website, and I wanted to have a cool name for my account. I finally came up with this: BlockheadRock970<br>
The ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù is from Minecraft<br>
The ‚Äúhead‚Äù is actually used with ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù for ‚ÄúBlockhead‚Äù, a word that derived from Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz.<br>
The ‚ÄúRock‚Äù is just a random word.<br>
The ‚Äú970‚Äù is also random.<br>
And when I created my account on here I shortened it down to B.H.R.</p>

            <p>Wouldn‚Äôt that be Volture instead of Voltur, or did you make a typo, or was that intentional.</p>
