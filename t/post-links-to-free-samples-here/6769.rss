            <p>The 7th pack was sourced from PureMagnetik, yes. Packs 1 and 5 were sourced through SampleTek (although 1 was supposedly from N. Flytt, but that got removed in Auxy 5), boom bass (technically pack 8) was the only melodic pack from blackoctopus. Unless it wasn’t explicitly labeled on the app, I don’t think any were from Cymatics however.</p>

            <p>Oh? Which ones?</p>
<p>I mean, the original acoustic guitars were a rebranded free sample library from DSK, but I didn’t think Auxy did anything with Cymatics.</p>

<p>I usually go to this website all the time, I think? And it’s THE best free samples website I found in my entire life. It’s where the dream is. -&gt; <a href="https://soundpacks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundpacks.com/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find a pack of your choice &amp; check it out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click download (nothing is allowed. Only a single tap)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the pack is downloaded, press the zip folder on files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy your new samples!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should go there, I swear. For noobies or people who don’t have imported samples, then go to the link in the post, thx. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> [EDIT: forgot to say this: If you don’t have the subscription, then your not lucky. If you need to get em, you’ll need to buy the premium subscription because it allows importing samples. Thx &amp; I’ll see you soon!</p>

            <p>Not sure why I didn’t look into this sooner, but the app Documents by Readdle will allow you to download audio to your device via a built in web browser with download functionality. Was just testing it on my phone, it’s really going to be about a thousand times better on the iPad but the good news is it looks totally free and seems to work pretty well (as a test I grabbed a break beat from Phatso’s Drum palace or whatever, worked just fine). You’ll still need something to convert to appropriate format in some cases but hey, at least you don’t need a computer to do all this stuff.</p>
<p>Now the million dollar question - AudioShare USED to have a web browser built in for this same purpose, but Apple made the dev remove it. Why does Readdle get a pass? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_monocle.png?v=6" title=":face_with_monocle:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_monocle:"></p>
