    <description>Piano -&gt; Strings -&gt; Electro Bass -&gt; Electro Drums -&gt; More Strings -&gt; Electric Guitar
Originally composed for Auxy Beat the Clock 25 (emotional piano). Frankly I ran out of time during the contest and just kept working on it ever since.


My first track with electric guitar (me playing). Recorded, mixed, and mastered with Bandlab post Auxy. I think I finally figured out how to make it sound like I want. It still could be synced better, but I like it enough to post it.

Please feel free to follow me (Cheddr) on Soundcloud, Twitter, and Reverbnation for more and thank you if you do.
