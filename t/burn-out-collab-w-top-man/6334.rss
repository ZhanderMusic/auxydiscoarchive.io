    <title>Burn Out (Collab w/Top Man)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/burn-out-collab-w-top-man/6334</link>
    <description>Myself and a user going by Top Man worked on this a while back and I never got around to posting.  He wrote some great hooks imo, and I added some stuff and did the arrangement.  Thanks Top Man if you’re still out there.
