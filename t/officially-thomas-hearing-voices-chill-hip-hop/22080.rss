    <title>Officially Thomas - Hearing Voices [Chill Hip Hop]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/officially-thomas-hearing-voices-chill-hip-hop/22080</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, this is my song “Hearing Voices.” I hope you all enjoy. This song is a combination of instruments you might find in classical music like Trumpet, Violin, etc but it also has elements of hip hop like 808s. You will hear me rap later on in the song. This song is about relating to feelings of loneliness.
