    <title>Split screening glitch on iPad?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/split-screening-glitch-on-ipad/13480</link>
    <description>I just got my new iPad and was trying to look for some progressive house examples on YouTube with Auxy opened up while YT was open on the side as a window, and I was gonna test out the rhythm I made based on the songs I listened to, then suddenly niether a synth or drum sound played when a note was placed nor when the project was played. Is it a bug? Or is it because of insufficient RAM?

            <p>We have done some general improvements to keeping the audio intact when relaunching the app so hopefully this should resolve this case too.</p>

            <p>I can’t imagine how Auxy would react with other DAWs in the background active, because YouTube is just a video streaming app, but with something like Garageband or FL, it might freak out. Earlier I was doing it with an AUX connected to a Bluetooth/AUX speaker, so I’d expect the same result with the iPad’s speakers.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately simultaneous audio does not work with split view using any apps (or even websites) I believe. What you’re describing is just Auxy’s way of saying: “I also don’t support simultaneous audio in split view/ overlapping apps.” (I have an IPad Pro so I’m kind of use to this :P)</p>

            <p>I have noticed that the playback in Auxy gets kind of agitated when you start working with any other audio (another audio app, a website with audio, etc). It’s even worse with Bluetooth audio outs.</p>
<p>A quick and dirty fix might be to enable Link in Auxy (this is the same trick that will let it play in the background). Things seem to go a little smoother with Link enabled. Just be careful if you’re working with other link enabled apps because your tempo can go nuts.</p>
<p>It might be worth shooting off an email to <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a> especially if you can reproduce the issue</p>

            <p>It could be, because when I press play on YT, it plays but when I do it with the audio playing at the same time, it shows the stop button on Auxy but the scan line that moves when in editor doesn’t appear, so maybe if I pause the audio and play the project, it might fix the issue, but I’ve noticed that glitch back when I had my iPhone 6 when music from another app was playing and nothing happened. Thanks for your insight!</p>
