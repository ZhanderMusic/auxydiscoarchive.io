    <title>Untitled - By Eswyn [Collab]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/untitled-by-eswyn-collab/3354</link>
    <description>So about two weeks ago, my phone broke (let’s just say it was raining and I tripped and it bent over the curb in my pocket). I was living off an old iPhone 5 for the last two weeks, but I couldn’t use Auxy. I tried downloading it, but the only downloadable version was before there were even any sound packs! I am now back onto a working phone, ready to get back into things! I’m looking for someone to collab on an upbeat trance-y track, a dark house/dubstep track, or a chill/lounge/ambient track. If anyone would like to do one or more of these, pm me with a song you think you’d like to work on! I’m glad to be back, and I hope we can make some great new tracks!</description>
