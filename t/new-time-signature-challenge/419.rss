    <title>New time signature challenge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-time-signature-challenge/419</link>
    <description>Hey guys! So I&#39;ve just finished a new track (see link below) I exclusively used triplets notes for every loop. The idea is that this gives the song a new time signature! Instead of counting a bar as 1,2,3,4 (4/4 time) you count this new layout as 1,2,3,4,5,6 (6/8 time). I wanted to challenge you guys to have a go doing the same! The only &quot;rule&quot; is that everything is snapped to either triplets or precision triplets. If you come up with something post it&#39;s link here! I&#39;d love to see what you guys think of it. This opens up so many new ideas... have fun
