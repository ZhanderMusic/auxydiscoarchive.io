    <description>Check out the [official announcement of AUXY 5](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-5-introducing-the-new-auxy/6605/) and let us know if you have any questions or thoughts about the premium subscription! 

#### About the Premium Subscription
In order to simplify our offering and put Auxy on a sustainable path forward, we&#39;re introducing a premium subscription that will replace the option to purchase individual sound packs. (Don&#39;t worry, your current packs will always be available regardless if you subscribe or not!) 

The subscription will allow us to invest in new features and drastically expand the sound library in a way that&#39;s affordable for all active users. It also simplifies sharing projects when everyone has access to all sounds.

**What&#39;s included in the subscription?**
- Unlimited access to all sound packs 
- Unlimited access to all samples
- Ability to import your own samples
- New sounds and samples that will be added monthly

**How much does it cost?**
- The price for a monthly subscription is $4.99 in the US App Store
- If you choose the yearly plan you get a 20% discount
- All countries will the same price tier but prices will be different depending on local tax and currency

**Is there a free trial?**
- All new subscribers get a 7-day free trial
- If you&#39;ve purchased sound packs, you&#39;ll get an extended free trial based on the number of packs you own

Read the [Subscription FAQ](http://auxy.co/subfaq.html) for more details.

            <p>I bought every single sound pack that came out btw (because i liked them). I was mad when the subscription came out because I couldn’t choose which packs I wanted to buy. Some months paying for auxy is a waste of money and others it is worth it. Not all the packs appeal to everyone and that is why I liked the sound pack method better.</p>

            <p>I might try the free trial for Auxy. I’ve been using the free sounds for quite a while, and they have really taught me a lot like automations and how to change it into a new cool sound.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the subscription is wayyy to expensive for me personally and my dad. Ill see after I try the free trial. <em>hopefully I can get it</em></p>

            <p>i doubt Auxy will be shutting down anytime soon but if they do im sure they’ll notify everyone (unless both devs randomly decide to jump ship).</p>
<p>But yeah, as far as i’ve seen with abandoned apps, in-app purchases will no longer be available and subscription sounds would be useless.  I’d hope that the devs would just unlock everything for everyone, but that’d feel like those who paid would have gotten ripped off.</p>
<p>Again tho, that ship has not sailed yet and i doubt it wil anytime soon.</p>

            <p>One aspect about the subscription model is - as far as I can see - not discussed here: What happens in case Auxy is closing their server - am I unable to record new tracks with the subscripted sounds? In other words: Are all these sounds useless?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been using Auxy since nearly the beginning, and although I am not really pleased with a subscription based “premium” business model as I don’t have a lot of means to afford it at this time, and I much preferred buying packs (and possibly purchasing in-app extra features, such as importing custom sound samples), it would be cool to see a couple more things going forward. Granted you guys seem to be developing a lot fo what I was wanting for, but is it a possibility to allow Audio Unit plugins like how Garageband iOS app works (or a better example, how most PC/MacOS DAW’s allow you to import VST plugins and such)? Also maybe having on-board in-app plugins such as a drum machine emulator? Either way and despite my few complaints, I will say great job thus far guys!</p>

            <p>To clarify, you’ll need an internet connection to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially purchase the subscription</li>
<li>Access, audition and use any uncached library sounds or imports</li>
<li>Sync and backup to iCloud</li>
</ul>
<p>WiFi is preferable to using data allowance as the library is quite large and you can end using many MBs checking out the library sounds.</p>

            <p>Oh boy where do I start?</p>
<p>Auxy 5, the update itself is ok, but the fact that you have to keep your subscription payed to use sounds is a dealbreaker for me. It’s the main reason why I still prefer Auxy 4.</p>
<p>I’m not the kinda person who would pay a subscription fee just to use the bare minimum of the app. I understand why the devs have to do so, they’re not making enough money.</p>

            <p>Well, even as a free user, your “argument” doesn’t really make any sense. They didn’t take away any sounds or anything like that, which I personally have no problem with. They took away the drums that were once free and gave back 2 mediocre packs, which is pretty bothersome to begin with, more so because they didn’t even mention it prior to the update.  Tbh, I wasn’t expecting much new for free users for the update, but was somehow dissapointed.</p>
<p>The devs offered more to paid users (which I have no problem with), but offered Less to free ones (problem).</p>
<p>I already explained my position on the subscription system &amp; stuff in a long post above, but if <em>you</em> want more sounds, just pay for them. That’s always been the case and there’s no reason for that to change.<br>
All that I want is just to have the drums back. Doesn’t even have to be all of them, but a few to give people something to work with.</p>

            <p>To auxy’s users and creators</p>
<p>I don’t like the auxy subscription. I’m not trying to hate on auxy, but I don’t think it’s very practical. I know the creators have to raise money somehow, but for all the people that can’t get the subscription or people that make music casually, we are stuck with the same sounds and 2 drum kits. So I have came up with some ideas that might appease my side of the argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Release old auxy sound packs from the past that might be outdated or not used often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make some low key sample packs for non subscribers. Thayer don’t have to made by a popular producer. Just something simple that we can use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make some more effects and editing options so that we can take the sounds we have and transform them to make new ones.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I’m not trying to hate on auxy. I just want to give my opinion on the auxy subscription. Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>So, you don’t ‘know’ at all then, basically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>now ya have to pay for everything you had for free</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only users who would think like that are those who never bought any sound packs - and who are now bitter at the idea that their (non-)custom might not be valued.</p>
<p>The previous revenue/business model might have sustained the company if a larger proportion of users regularly bought sound packs.</p>

            <p>I know this because no company can thrive without money. They just made it free at first to bait us in and then say, “Oh, ya know, now ya have to pay for everything you had for free. Your choice of whether you like our app enough to do so.” They would have to add a subscription eventually. They just had to decide when…</p>

            <p>I do too, that’s what I’m most interested in. I’ve honestly wanted to develop my own sort of VST extension that functions similar to auxy, as a wavetable and sample player that hopefully would be able to craft the sounds in the way I desire. I can’t seem to find it anymore though, I really want to see that screenshot again though x3</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> thanks man x3</p>
<p>Seeing that screenshot actually helps a lot, specifically when attempting to recreate sound slopes. I didn’t realize it was exponentially generated.</p>
