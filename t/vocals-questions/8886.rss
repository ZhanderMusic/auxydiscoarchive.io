    <description>Hey, 
So i&#39;m getting a little more interested every day about adding some vocals to some of my tracks. I&#39;m not asking anyone to do them for me(lol, like everybody else&#39;s topics that have &quot;vocals&quot; in it), but I have some questions regarding the whole process of recording them/editing them/adding them to the actual track. If anyone can answer or tell their opinion or process for this that would be sweett.

What kind of microphone do you use. Do you need a filtered one?
What do you record it on? What app, software do you guys record it to? 
Do you guys edit it/autotune the pitch to it? If so, how and on what?
How do you layer it onto your track? Since Auxy doesn&#39;t support vocals and layering long samples, what do you guys do to add it in? Is there a nice equalizer somewhere that allows you to master and balance the volume?

Thanks for reading and listening to these clueless questions. Hoping to drop some vocals soon!</description>

<p>All kidding aside, GarageBand is a logical choice (no pun intended) because it comes for free on iOS. It’s a good work horse.</p>
<p>Read up on microphones. It comes down to condenser or dynamic. Condenser mics are very, very sensitive. I’ve destroyed my fair share. Condenser mics also require phantom power so whatever you’re plugging into needs to supply the +48v line (a lot of times it’s just a 9 volt battery in something, but whatever).</p>
<p>I have Voloco and Autotune mobile. Autotune mobile is ok. It supports inter-app audio which is neat. Voloco does not. But, you can play a track in the BG and record in Voloco. Truth told, I don’t really do any vocal stuff as much as I’d like to.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about “mastering” - worry more about getting the mix right. The vocal should stand out but should NOT stand very far out from the song otherwise it sounds like bad karaoke.</p>
<p>Hope this helps some.</p>

            <p>A lot of people use garage band. As for the questions about microphone quality and such, I’d recommend doing your own reasearch on YouTube or Google. You can still make it sound good with a bad mic as long as you don’t plan on making it a vocal-based track, because you can just</p>
