&lt;big&gt; **Featured Auxy Artist #23: @TAURUS**  &lt;/big&gt; 
 
 &lt;big&gt;T&lt;/big&gt;aurus is the second astrological sign in the zodiac and is represented by a BULL. I&#39;m assuming the logo above represents bull horns. There&#39;s no bull emoji available to drop here, so here&#39;s a picture of a poodle instead:  :poodle:  

TAURUS is also the producer name for Josue Jara (pronounced “Hoe-sway” “Hah-rah”). His previous alias was &#39;Noble&#39; when he produced using Garageband.  He loves making music and aspires to being a professional.  He gets inspiration from  [Deorro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pfDAQNP3Rc), [KSHMR](https://www.youtube.com/user/KSHMRmusic) &amp; [Martin Garrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/MartinGarrix).

Taurus shared a wee fun-fact with us: -  he&#39;s 5’5!

            <p>Sorry I didn’t get to look at any of your tracks, they had me booked yet again at work this week and the only two days I had off I wasn’t feeling the best. :&lt;&lt; I’ve heard good things though and I’ll do my best to check it out later though!</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/taurus">@TAURUS</a>! Sorry for the SUPER last second reply. I was going to type it up earlier and got kinda distracted like I usually do. After listening to a bunch of your tracks, I feel like I can definitely notice an evolution in your style. I feel like your newer tracks feel a lot more… well…  ‘full’ I guess. I like the way a lot of your newer pieces come together. I really like the variation in styles though. I like the kind of chill vibes of Feelings and Thoughts. Those two tracks were really nicely composed and had some great sound design. I discovered your Collab Rift a while ago and have always been a fan of it. You and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a> did some SICK work on that one. I’m always a fan of Slope basslines and you two mixed it very well. Overall a very awesome track. Your Collab Cougar with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a> was also really well thought out. Deep bass sounds and awesome drum fills made for a great feel. Gave me the chills lol. I love the trancey feel of The Younger Years - it has a really well executed shifting baseline around 1:45. I’ve followed you and will make sure to check out some of your even older tracks too. Sorry I couldn’t give super structured feedback - I just wanted to make sure I got this in before the topic locked. Keep up the good work. I’ll make sure to follow you in a minute!</p>
<p>Woah I was just listening some more - 4 Your Duroz Only is awesome. This bass is the best thing. Nicely done mate.</p>
<p>One more thing - I think one of my favorites has to be Wildfire now that I’ve listened to it. It’s constantly evolving and has some great sound design. I love the little <em>climb?</em> arpeggio, and the drop has a great beat. Just wanted to throw that in.</p>
<p>(Also I remember when Watermelon got featured. Great track. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</p>

            <p>Hey Taurus,</p>
<p>I like the way your tracks are quite varied and use a range of sounds. And I smiled when I saw your genre tags in Soundcloud. Like IDK, Whatever &amp; Emotionalish. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Also your drums are always interesting to listen to.</p>
<p>After listening to a bunch of your tracks in a row, my favs are</p>
<ul>
<li>The pop appeal of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/taurus_14_josue/watermelon">Watermelon</a>.</li>
<li>The arps and samples of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/taurus_14_josue/im-coming">Coming</a>.</li>
<li>Bass and stabs in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/taurus_14_josue/the-younger-years">The Younger Years</a>.</li>
<li>The dark undertones of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/taurus_14_josue/hitman">Hitman</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being our Forum Member of the Week!</p>

            <p>Love your music <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/taurus">@TAURUS</a>!</p>
<p>Thoughts - Really cool percussion in the beginning. I love the arps in the middle. The second drop is pretty cool. I’d recommend layering the bass a bit more though. Great job overall!</p>

I still remember that <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a> introduced me to your music, and I’ve been a fan ever since. Just as South, your music showed me that it was possible to make hard house in Auxy, and that was something I really needed to hear at the time. Therefore I really prefer all your heavier songs. Prey is definitely one of my all time favorite Auxy songs, I can keep listening to that one. Watermelon and The Younger Years are awesome as well! I noticed that you’re making some more chill and mellow stuff too, which is great. I especially like Thoughts and Coming. When listening to Thoughts my first thoughts (oh snap) were that the second drop could use a little more sub bass, but that’s my personal preference. Great track nevertheless!<br>
It’s a shame we never really collabed after we agreed to do it.<br>
Keep it up man!</p>

            <p>Great variety coming from you, effective in heavy tracks but can also let you calm down to the tranquility of some of his songs. Love the old heavy future house sorta style but you have changed from then and you have made a success so far.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and never give up!</p>

            <p>I like your song LOL<br>
And I really like all the arps in your songs, I think they are catchy but simple (if that makes sense)<br>
I also like the way you tune your instruments.<br>
However a lot of your songs don’t have melodies, and I think they would benefit from one.</p>

            <p>I’m not a real heavy kind of guy (as many of you know) but your music still appeals to me. The arp in “The Younger Years” is memorable for me, and there’s always at least a few things that stand out in each of your songs. You also seem like a friendly person around here.</p>
