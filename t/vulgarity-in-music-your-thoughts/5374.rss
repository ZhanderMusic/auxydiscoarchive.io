    <title>Vulgarity in music - Your thoughts?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/vulgarity-in-music-your-thoughts/5374</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

As I’ve been working very hard to develop an official album, I’ve had to think about many aspects of what will stay or what will go in this major release. A diverse array of genres? All brand new music or some old “refurbished” projects? A transition from my recognized style to something totally fresh? All of these have undergone careful consideration. However, one facet of my musical preference has stood out to me lately and I cannot let it go.

I’ve gotten some heat before for including “explicit content” in my music before (i.e. I was told that I’d lose my following and would not progress from here if I continued to make any explicit music). I’ve looked around, and I am one of very few who have done so in the Auxy community. And I certainly plan on continuing to do so in future releases.

So, I have a few questions to ask and I’d like to know your thoughts.

1) Do you deem vulgar lyrics or suggestive themes in an artist’s music as merely crude and unnecessary? Why or why not?
2) Would having the “EXPLICIT” label on a track completely deter you from listening to it, even if it were just one word? Or could you appreciate the music from a wholistic point of view?
3) Might _you_ ever include vulgarity (of any degree) in your own music? Why or why not?

There is a wide range of demographics in this community, so I am teeming with curiousity. I’m also happy to answer any questions you might have for myself.

            <p>I don’t swear my self and I would never have it in my own music but I listen to one or two songs that swear. To me as long as it’s not extreme or offensive I think you should just do you. I don’t like to listen to profanity if I can help it though.</p>

            <p>All I have to say is that only YOU put power in the word. I think vulgarity is necessary when it is expressed in the emotions and the statements you sing. Not when it is about sex or anything hateful or offensive</p>

            <ol>
<li>I would say so. Unless it’s meant to be angry and powerful, like a diss track, vulgar language is not worth its while in music.</li>
<li>I’m not entirely sure.</li>
<li>Only to the extent of saying words like hell and crap, not any of the more offensive words.</li>

            <p>Vulgarity, to me, is not required in music, but still shouldn’t be in it. Vulgarity is terrible (though I do sometimes use it) in music as is rapping not needed (yeah, I hate rap music).</p>

            <p>My general philosophy is that, when you’re making art, nothing is sacred. You may go as far as you wish in your art because it’s yours. Some of the best art of the past century, music or not, is renowned because it pushed boundaries in the right way.</p>

            <p>Profanity has its place in certain songs if it’s used effectively (ie, not spamming the F-bomb every other lyric). I personally wouldn’t put any profanity or explicit stuff in my own music because I myself try not to swear and don’t really see how it could fit in with my music anyways, but hearing swearing or seeing an EXPLICIT label in other’s music doesn’t bother me at all (it sometimes even makes it better). As for explicit stuff, it depends on how explicit we’re talking.</p>

            <p>If they aren’t offensive, I don’t see why not. It is your choice. If I see EXPLICIT on one of your tracks, I’d still listen to it (because it’s an <em>IVO</em> track <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">) but if there’s too much in there, I probably wouldn’t listen to it anymore. I personally would never include explicit content, just due to the large amount of younger users here including me.</p>
<p>If you use only one word in a track, I guess it’s fine, as long as you aren’t swearing at a person or a group of people in the track (offending anyone). Yes, you are right that pretty much no one else uses explicit content in their songs, but like I said before, there is a vast amount of little kids here. Just don’t use too much of it or else people will actually start unfollowing you and all. I know you’re a nice person, lots of Auxians do, but cussing in vocal tracks (even if it’s just once) may change people’s opinion on you in a bad way. And you don’t want that.</p>
<p>Like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/crystldawnmusic">@crystldawnmusic</a> said, I don’t like swearing in songs, so clean versions would be cool. But what’s the point of posting the same track twice where the only difference is the changing one word? It’s easier to not swear at all.</p>
<p>I did hear the f bomb in King of Hearts, but it was only said once. I just want to let you know that you should probably swear less often. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Is it one word repeated many times? Or is is just one word in the entire song?</p>
<p>Depends on the word as well. If it’s an F bomb spammed throughted the song, then that’s a no. If it’s like in your song Vs. Southborne, then that’s more ok. But don’t do it just for the sake of doing it. If you can’t find a good reason for it making people want to listen to the song, then idk.  I think it’ll be a deterrent to the younger members of this community tho, which could lead to some loss in fans.</p>

            <p>I’m surprised to hear this from you <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xavior">@xavior</a>.   You must be the really diiiirty mod!  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>
<p>Personally, I’m pretty liberal about things. An EXPLICIT label wouldn’t affect me at all. It would probably make me more inclined to look.</p>
<p>But, I wouldn’t want kids to be exposed to naked pics in covers posted online, or to hear something inappropriate for their age - so I support the use of warning labels.  Please don’t post yourself on the cover IVO!!!</p>
<p>Another consideration is that if someone’s using their real identity, other people such as future employers, partner, family member, teachers or police(!) may see it online.  What someone posts today, may haunt them tomorrow. Obviously, there’s degrees of vulgarity, ranging from bad language to…  well, you know.</p>
<p>Is this for a Christmas Track?  hahaha</p>

            <p>Doesn’t matter to me. I would definitely say some explicit and controversial stuff in my songs if I knew how to record vocals.</p>

<p>I don’t because they’re just words. As long as they aren’t racial or offensive terms, I’m completely fine with them.</p>

<p>Having the explicit label does draw away some aspect of the track for some people… as long as there is an clean/alternate version without the vulgarity, I think that it’d be fine for everyone.</p>
<p>I do continuously appreciate music from a complete point of view.</p>

            <p>I think the point of an album is to show who you are as an artist. So, do what people know you for. I have no problem listening to explicit music, I was like 12 when I started listening to rap. But I can’t speak for everyone. If Pink Season can top the charts, I don’t see how making explicit music can hurt your following…</p>

            <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>As I’ve been working very hard to develop an official album, I’ve had to think about many aspects of what will stay or what will go in this major release. A diverse array of genres? All brand new music or some old “refurbished” projects? A transition from my recognized style to something totally fresh? All of these have undergone careful consideration. However, one facet of my musical preference has stood out to me lately and I cannot let it go.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten some heat before for including “explicit content” in my music before (i.e. I was told that I’d lose my following and would not progress from here if I continued to make any explicit music). I’ve looked around, and I am one of very few who have done so in the Auxy community. And I certainly plan on continuing to do so in future releases.</p>
<p>So, I have a few questions to ask and I’d like to know your thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you deem vulgar lyrics or suggestive themes in an artist’s music as merely crude and unnecessary? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Would having the “EXPLICIT” label on a track completely deter you from listening to it, even if it were just one word? Or could you appreciate the music from a wholistic point of view?</li>
<li>Might <em>you</em> ever include vulgarity (of any degree) in your own music? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a wide range of demographics in this community, so I am teeming with curiousity. I’m also happy to answer any questions you might have for myself.</p>
<p><em><strong>IVO</strong></em></p>
