    <description>If I’m a developer, I would make sampled genres for every time you make a new empty project. There will be 4 types: House,Trap, Future Bass, And Electronic (Possibly DnB.) Now, I want to know what you people, the Auxy Community, would do if you were the developers of Auxy.</description>

    TL;DR Spotlight search 
I have to mention that <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TC64">@TC64</a> reminded me of this feature so thanks toxic <img width="20" height="20" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=10" title="slight_smile" alt="slight_smile" class="emoji"> 
Anyway, hasn’t everybody experience the frustration of trying to find a specific Auxy project just by name or creation date? Ever wished you could just search? 
Turns out, you can! Here’s how: 

Exit to the home screen
Pull down anywhere to open Spotlight
Type in the name of your song
Click the project name under Auxy 
<a class="lightbox" href="https://disco.auxy.co/uploads/auxy/original/1X/d0072ec2f887f728aa85a27100dd57244215dcf2.PNG" title="IMG_6658.PNG">[IMG_6658]</a>

Come back to this post and give it a like or something…
