    <description>Are you exporting from Auxy and calling it a day? Exporting stems and mixing in something else? Do you master your tracks, or have someone master them for you?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I export tracks into Auria where I use the fab filter EQ to get a sense of whether the track is balanced or not.  I try to identify eq problems or excessive peaks here, then go back into Auxy and try to fix them in the originals. Having done that, I will go into Auria one more time for minor eq cleanup and compression/limiting. Sometimes even that is not necessary.</p>

            <p>Currently writing an LP and my workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export whole track as single WAV</li>
<li>Import to Reaper</li>
<li>Mix vocals/other stuff that I couldn’t do in Auxy so that whole track is around -6DB</li>
<li>Send off for mastering using Fiverr</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not an expert by all means, but I have been learning how to get the mixes ready for mastering and I think I have a simple process down now. If anybody wants any info hit me up!</p>
<p>I tried mastering myself, but it’s hard and there are people on Fiverr who do a great job and charge like £40 for 10 tracks</p>

<p>EMastered… I think the pricing might be better,</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the head-2-head comparisons that I’ve read, Landr and CloudBounce usually beat out eMastered on quality output.</p>
<p>CloudBounce is also cheaper on subscription than eMastered thanks to the $79-$99/year countdown offers that pop up fairly regularly. It’s also cheaper if you want to pay ‘per master’ too. Cb is $4.90, eM is $4.99 + $6/month for the (basic) Plus package.</p>
<p>Of course, if you prefer the output of eMastered to CloudBonce, then you should always aim to use the one that sounds best to you.</p>

Similar to Cloudbounce is <a href="https://emastered.com/?refid=379741#professional-sound">emastered</a>. Never actually bought it myself, but I saw <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCOXsGjFIo0PBeKe2mA3H9SQ">InsprAspr</a> use it for his tracks and they sound pretty solid. Also I think the pricing might be better, but depends on what you’re looking for I suppose.</p>

            <p>My ears aren’t good enough, so I check my mix on a few systems and then just started using CloudBounce to master. $5 made a big difference. Highly recommended Or BandLab is free, and did a good job as well.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the CloudBounce recommendation. I’d tried BandLab for free, but I think you’re right. CloudBounce is worth the $5.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I finish a track in Auxy, I usually have done a pretty great job and so it’s mostly just export and call it a day.  Almost always sounds great on multiple listening setups.  If I want to play with it a bit, I run it through DAW Cassette, very tastefully, and then Grand Finale.  But that’s just for flavor.  I don’t find anything lacking in the Auxy export</p>

<p>Agreed.<br>
For price/quality they’re hard to beat.</p>

            <p>‘Release-ready’ is a rare state for me.</p>
<p>I never upload a finished piece directly from Auxy to SC, only WIPs, primarily for my own review purposes.</p>
<p>I’d like to be better at mixing and mastering myself as my tracks are often muddy, but at my current level, I tend to do more harm than good.</p>
<p>So for now, I lean on auto-mastering services like <a href="https://www.landr.com">Landr</a> or <a href="https://www.cloudbounce.com">CloudBounce</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll sometimes use Landr’s free 192 kbps MP3 mastered output as an ‘in-between’ review copy, between the Auxy output and a (paid-for) CloudBounce output.</p>
<p>When I’m ready for a decent (auto-)master, I’ve recently been impressed by CloudBounce for both quality and price. I’m thinking of buying an unlimited annual package, next time they run an offer.</p>
<p>(BandLab’s auto-mastering is too hit n miss for regular, reliable use.)</p>

<p>That’s very generous of you. Sacrificing a potential improvement in your track quality (and potentially some success) for the sake of showcasing an app that you’re not the owner of, don’t work for and don’t have any financial stake in - presumably, for free. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

I mix them there, then I master the mix.</p>
