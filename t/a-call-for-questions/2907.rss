    <title>A Call For Questions</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-call-for-questions/2907</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been really inspired by both the talent and enthusiasm of everybody here.
I&#39;d like to give a little back by sharing some of my knowledge.

My musical tastes mean I&#39;m of little use in making drops or wubs (am I doing it right?), but I do have a degree and about 20 years experience working as an audio engineer.

I&#39;ve spent the past few days putting together a bunch short, actionable tips you can use to improve your tracks using nothing but Auxy.

So far I&#39;ve focussed mainly on basic mixing and mono compatibility, but if there is anything you&#39;d like me to cover, please let me know.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>OK, been living with a pair of Sennheiser HD 380 Pro for the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Very clean sound. Already helping me find a couple of issues with my mixes, which will help me develop better mixing habits. Very useful. Very comfortable too.</p>
<p>To my still as-yet-untrained ear, it seems like clean representation across the lows, mids and highs. Highs aren’t screaming and lows aren’t muddy.</p>
<p>It’s a bit alarming at first, having such an uncoloured sound. Felt a little clinical. And I wasn’t sure if I liked it. But after a little while messing with my levels on my Audio Interface, I think I’ve got a halfway decent reference now. (My headphone volume dials are no longer maxed out. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>They’ll be strictly for the reference and mixing, not for regular listening.</p>
<p>But, I will revisit the settings on my Sony MDR-XB950B1 listening headphones to possibly trim back on some of that extra-extra bass. (Ironically, I bought them for the extra bass, while replacing a second pair of badly treated AKG Y50 to die on me. Fwiw, the AKG Y50 are also quite honestly balanced considering they’re regular listening headphone aimed at ‘style’, not mixing/monitoring. AKG are quite reliable and honest across the board, sound-wise. (I didn’t want that honesty at the time. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>It’ll also help me use my Sennheiser Momentum M2 IEi in-ear more knowingly.</p>
<p>I suspect having — and regularly using — a good pair of reference/monitor headphones will ‘retrain’ my ears to better appreciate subtlety and be more discerning — and make me a better ‘listener’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>

[Edit: Seems we should all be buying these now… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>The ATH m50x are good and dependable, and are reknown for their accuracy, clarity, frequency response, and budget friendliness (they are the best within the $200 price range). I personally own the ATH MSR7s. The only complaint I would have is that the fit is not ideal for my head size. So if you are looking for studio headphones, make sure that you will be able to have them on for 4 hours at least. My MSR7s broke in soon enough, but they were really uncomfortable when I got them. IMHO don’t look at anything above 300, to a beginning musician, anything over that is hard to appreciate.</p>

            <p>That helps a lot. I knew that qualitative difference in studio speakers that I got a while ago, but wasn’t sure about headphones much…</p>
<p>Thanks for The articles, narrowed it down to 2 options and will test them in a music store soon. Thanks man.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> I’ll try the aiaiai’s and Beyerdynamic first thing. Both around 130-150 I think, I can let you know how this goes <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand/3.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:t3:"></p>

<p>I know this is slightly of topic - but would you have any recommendations for headphones when it comes to ideal audio transfer using auxy <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/nrgb">@nrgb</a>?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The most important thing to look for when buying headphones (or speakers) is a flat frequency response.</p>
<p>Most consumer headphones will boost certain frequencies (like a bit of bass boost) because it generally sounds better to the average listener.</p>
<p>This is problematic for music producers because they aren’t hearing an accurate representation of their song.</p>
<p>If you mix your tracks on <em>bassy</em> headphones you may find that they are actually lacking bottom end when you play them on a flat sound system.</p>
<p>If you’re aware that your gear adds a little colour, you can learn to compensate, but it’s generally easier to not have to.</p>
<p>Without knowing your budget it’s hard to recommend something, but once you’ve settled on a pair I would do a little googling to see what others are saying. (the gearslutz forum is a good start)</p>
<p>As a starting point try AKG, Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic or Sennheiser.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate that there are styles and occasions that call for more headroom, and if this is something people are looking for, I think a better solution would be to add e.g. a setting for the master effects instead of suggesting that people turn down the levels. I can guarantee you that there’s plenty of headroom in the mix bus, and what you refer to as clipping is mainly coming from the limiter in the final mix stage.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d appreciate some access to the master effects.<br>
Part of my motivation for recording everything at a lower level is to avoid the limiter.</p>

            <p>Thanks for chiming in <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a></p>
<p>I’ve just edited (removed) the post in question. (could probably be deleted tbh)</p>
<p>I think it probably went outside my initial goal of ‘simple’ tips, and you’re completely right, Auxy should handle most people’s mixing needs.</p>

            <p>Yeah we have some work to do to simplify matching sounds together and perhaps adding options for tuning sounds so that they match, in addition to the filters we already have in place.</p>

            <p>And thank you so much for that!  I’ve noticed recently that for me when I’m having an issue with something not standing out like i want it to, it’s usually an arrangement problem rather than not enough headroom.  So I’ve been going through and rewriting parts so I don’t have a bunch of stuff competing in the same register and once I did that, everything started geling much better and the whole mix was LOUD AS @*^%!   Some leads were so in your face I had to think of ways to soften them up a bit.  So I think the system works really well.  Even if you do compose sloppily overlapping parts intended to stand out, you can still get a decent mix like I have before. Just turn all the faders down and start from there.</p>

            <p>I should also mention that our philosophy is to try and pack as much “mix intelligence” into the app as possible, so that people don’t have to spend years learning mix techniques. So whenever we see someone hacking things together or complaining about “not getting enough bass” or similar things, we try to figure out a way to solve that without forcing the user to change his/her workflow too much.</p>
<p>There’s already a lot of stuff baked into the app that you’re probably not aware of. One example is that we auto tune the sub part of each kick to fit the currently selected key. “It just works!”</p>

            <p>Great initiative!</p>
<p>To clarify though, Auxy is designed to have a pretty maxed out mix with little headroom, since that’s how modern tracks usually sound. We’ve spent quite a lot of time with Grammy-winning mix engineer Niklas Flyckt, who currently mixes all of Galantis’ tracks to name one example, working out settings that will make tracks sound like finished tracks in the typical genres you would create with Auxy.</p>
<p>We appreciate that there are styles and occasions that call for more headroom, and if this is something people are looking for, I think a better solution would be to add e.g. a setting for the master effects instead of suggesting that people turn down the levels. I can guarantee you that there’s plenty of headroom in the mix bus, and what you refer to as clipping is mainly coming from the limiter in the final mix stage.</p>
