    <title>Should the demo sounds be changed?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/should-the-demo-sounds-be-changed/14745</link>
    <description>Edit: This post is for discussion about whether Auxy’s demo sounds represent all of Auxy’s sounds!

We’ve had the same demo sounds for a long time, but now there are several more sound packs which they don’t represent.
For those who don’t know, the demo sounds are Spray, Mascara, Origin, Pebble, Pasta, Egg, Bold Steel, Climb, Barber, and Dirt.
[poll type=regular results=always]
* They represent Auxy’s sounds well
* They don’t represent Auxy’s sounds well

            <p>Why don’t you just use the bitcrusher distortion to achieve the same thing? All the same sound shaping controls are available in the un-sub version.</p>
<p>I do think the sub is a good value, but for your use case, it might not be necessary…</p>

            <p>There’s no doubt in my mind that the new options breathe more life into the demo sounds. I get people need to weigh financial considerations when it comes to subscriptions, especially since so many things are subscription based, but for people who really use the app a lot the asking price is pretty low for what you get, and the additional sounds and sample library astronomically increase the breadth of texture and sound available (not to mention, anything you’re still missing you can just import).</p>

            <p>I think it’s really good to have “real life” instruments as demo sounds. I don’t really think any demo sounds should be changed. I just feel like they should add more. Especially when the original sound pack <em>was</em> the demo pack. There’s definitely a shortage on demo sounds now because of Auxy 5</p>

            <p>I think that the demo sounds should definitely be changed. I think we need less “real life” instruments and more “digital” instruments. We don’t need origin, pebble, AND bold steel. Maybe just keep origin, get rid of the other two. I also don’t think barber, pasta, and mascara are good sounds either. So keep origin, spray, egg, climb, and dirt. To replace the other ones, maybe add something from disturbing leads or panic attack (maybe belt or horror), maybe grizzly or owl (from the future), floppy or kilobyte (from game waves), velvet or organism (from standard deviation), frenzy or voodoo (from heavy bass), and high heels or pastel (from retrofit). I also think that the drums should be changed because for such a MASSIVE sample library, you don’t get much OR any good samples with battery and dawn. Maybe change the demo kits to fringe, tickle, and spiral because they are decent kits that represent the amazing sample library nicely. Also, maybe add the sweeper? I don’t understand why it isn’t in there, I end up having you use a reverse imp for that, which is fine, but the sweeper is better I think. So, here’s a list of all of the new demo sounds I suggested to use:</p>
<p>Bass:</p>
<p>Dirt<br>
Owl<br>
Organism<br>
Voodoo</p>
<p>Lead:</p>
<p>Origin<br>
Spray<br>
Egg<br>
Climb<br>
Belt<br>
Kilobyte<br>
Pastel</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<p>Sweeper</p>
<p>Drum Kits:</p>
<p>Fringe<br>
Spiral<br>
Tickle</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s what I think.</p>

            <p>Yes auxy wouldn’t be alive today if it weren’t for the monthly prescription (well not moving forward), but eventually they will have enough sound packs to the point where it would be more beneficial to price them by the pack instead of the prescription. It’s quite a process but all we can do is wait.</p>

            <p>If a guitar is part of the demo sounds, why not add a bass from the Heavy Bass pack? It makes enough sense to me. I don’t really think it matters which bass form the pack, but bass and guitar are a good pair to have. Also, was it just me or didn’t the demo sounds have an orchestral strings sound? I feel like I remember there being a sound from that pack.</p>
<p>Even if there’s just one more sound added to the demo pack, it would make a big difference for those who are trying out the app for the first time.</p>
<p>I personally feel like adding a sound from each pack can damage sales for Auxy.<br>
But I also wish we had the pay-for-each-AP. Honestly I miss that and I would rather have that, but I respect <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> ’s decision on the subscription fee. I’m guessing the subscription makes it possible for there to be a sound pack every month?</p>

            <p>Generally in this context, just saying what you want without a good reason is not a good strategy. Glad to hear you care about opinions, but even then, it’s a lot more effective to give a good argument for your idea.</p>

<p>I’m seeing a lot of people suggest the instruments <em>they like</em> , or giving feature requests for things <em>they want</em> , but the devs don’t really care about that, at all.</p>

<p>No, we want to hear everyone’s personal opinion, but we’ll do the job of separating common requests from individual wishes.</p>
<p>It’s always better to describe a <em>problem</em> or <em>what you want to achieve</em> rather than explicit features. for example, it’s better to say “I usually make errors in the note editor which are hard to correct” rather than “we need undo”.</p>
<p>We’re more interested to hear problems and goals rather than ideas for features.</p>

            <p>One general suggestion…</p>
<p>I’m seeing a lot of people suggest the instruments <em>they like</em>, or giving feature requests for things <em>they want</em>, but the devs don’t really care about that, at all. Sounds insensitive, but it’s true — the devs will be <strong>a lot</strong> more likely to listen to you if you give a reason why your idea benefits the app.</p>
<p>So if you focus your posts more on things that the devs like, they’ll pay a lot more attention to you.</p>
