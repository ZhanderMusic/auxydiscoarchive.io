            <p>for some real tension- make the last note of the melody 4 steps higher than the first note of the melody. for instance… if your melody starts on the 1 note (A for example) end the melody on the 5 (E) you can design chords in the same way also. build a chord for the end that starts on the 5 and it should want to resolve back to the beginning again.</p>

            <p>It can sound weird when something loops where the first note of the loop is far away pitch wise from the last note.  So you gotta make the loop lead back to itself.  This could mean having the last note be one note/scale degree away from the first.  Gotta smooth out those lines.  And like others have said, with chords if you’re landing on the tonic chord at the end of a phrase it’s going to sound very final.</p>

            <p>Yeah, presumably it sounds like it shouldn’t repeat because you’ve resolved the progression (I.e. reached the root of the key). Omitting the final chord may achieve the unresolved sound, or changing to another chord might create the right tension. Sometimes I replace the chord with a short melody that leads towards (but does not reach) the root note.</p>

            <p>You could drop it out essentially creating a second rhythm to tie it together using the low pass and high pass filters.<br>

            <p>Maybe change a note in the last chord to be one or two notes above or below the first chord, so it has a little bit of change. Also maybe a pitch bend at the end of each bar would sound cool/help the transition.</p>

            <p>Well the last chord is the same as the first chord which could be a problem but it sounds bad if it isn’t.</p>

            <p>Maybe for the chords, in the last bar of the loop, make a chord that helps transition back to the very start of the loop. So if the beginning of the chord loop is low , and the end is high, make a transition at the end that helps it change back low.</p>
