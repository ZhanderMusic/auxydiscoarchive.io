            <p>I love lofi, and as long as we‚Äôre giving helpful feedback, I agree with the others on the kick. A softer kick with less lowpass generally sounds great on lofi, and I think the piano could also use a dial down on the lowpass. Loved the melody though, you should make a remastered version.</p>
<p>Something else you might wanna try is adding a kick ducker to your chords to emphasize your kick drum without it actually being super loud. I don‚Äôt know why, but for some reason it gives off a lofi-feel.</p>

            <p>Oof the drums were a little too loud, but dang this was a classic LoFi song. Sounds like the others I‚Äôve been listening too, this is very chill and nice!</p>

            <p>Nice track. It feels a bit ‚Äúempty‚Äù with mainly your piano melody and a boom bass being prominently audible. Consider throwing in a couple light pads in the background next time.</p>

            <p>Like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon73773654">@anon73773654</a> said, kick is pretty loud, especially for lofi. Also, I think the kick itself could be a different sample.</p>
<p>Near the end it gets pretty repetitive, same chords, same melody, same beat, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>All in all, though, this is pretty great! I can definitely see this be a good song to chill to. Just a little hard to chill to it with that kick, lol. Is this your first lofi track, though? If so, this is pretty good. Even as your second or third this is still pretty good.</p>
<p>Quick suggestion: You should change your soundcloud link to your name or something. It looks more professional to have your name in the link rather than ‚Äúuser-560584068‚Äù</p>
