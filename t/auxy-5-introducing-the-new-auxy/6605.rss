    <title>AUXY 5 - Introducing the New Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-5-introducing-the-new-auxy/6605</link>
    <description>ü•Åü•Åü•Å

We&#39;re super excited to announce that **AUXY 5** is rolling out today! Without further ado, here&#39;s what&#39;s new:

#### Huge Sample Library
We&#39;ve partnered with [Black Octopus](https://blackoctopus-sound.com) to bring you a massive library of high quality samples. There are currently eight different sound packs with over 3,000 drum, percussion and effect samples. In addition, new sounds will be added every month.

#### New Drum Instrument
We&#39;re taking drums to the next level with a redesigned drum instrument:
- Build custom kits with samples from the library
- Start with an empty kit or one of many new presets
- Each drum sound now has the following individual tweaks: pitch (step in semitones), tune (fine tune the pitch), reverb, length, lowpass, highpass, offset (adjust the timing of the hit), pan, volume
- Samples with a &quot;ramp up&quot; before the primary hit will automatically start playing before the note to stay in sync with the beat (try the &quot;Shifted Snares&quot; in &quot;Leviathan&quot; pack to hear the magic!)

#### Import Your Own Samples
In addition to the new library, you can now import wav files via iCloud and use them in the new drum instrument. Check out the [Sample Import FAQ](http://auxy.co/importfaq.html) to learn how it works.

#### New Sound Packs
We&#39;ve added two sounds packs:
- Boom Bass: Tuned bass drum samples to give Punch some competition
- Destiny: New synth sounds by 7 Skies

#### Updated Sounds
- All sounds now have a full set of tweaks (tone, shape, etc.)
- All sounds now pan correctly

#### Redesigned Sound Browser with Favorites
You can now favorite any sound or sample for quick access in the browser. All sounds and samples now live in the cloud, which means you only have to download the sounds that are used in a project instead of entire packs.

#### More Instruments
You can now add up to 20 instruments in each project. We also think the new drum instrument will reduce the need to add multiple drum tracks with one sample in each.

#### Premium Subscription
In order to simplify our offering and put Auxy on a sustainable path forward, we&#39;re introducing a premium subscription that will replace the option to purchase individual sound packs. (Don&#39;t worry, your current packs will always be available regardless if you subscribe or not!) 

The subscription will allow us to invest in new features and drastically expand the sound library in a way that&#39;s affordable for all active users. It also simplifies sharing projects when everyone has access to all sounds.

**What&#39;s included in the subscription?**
- Unlimited access to all sound packs 
- Unlimited access to all samples
- Ability to import your own samples
- New sounds and samples that will be added monthly

**How much does it cost?**
- The price for a monthly subscription is $4.99 in the US App Store
- If you choose the yearly plan you get a 20% discount
- All countries will the same price tier but prices will be different depending on local tax and currency

**Is there a free trial?**
- All new subscribers get a 7-day free trial
- If you&#39;ve purchased sound packs, you&#39;ll get an extended free trial based on the number of packs you own

Read the [Subscription FAQ](http://auxy.co/subfaq.html) for more details.

            <p>Auxy could use an update, if it‚Äôs been a year. But the devs have been rolling out tons of new sound packs, not to mention the 2 new ones we just got in one month <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=6" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:">, so they are probably doing their best, and I guess we might not actually need a update‚Ä¶ but</p>
<p><em>Please add master effects</em></p>

            <p>Finally updated to iOS 11 and finally got the new Auxy as well as the newest update, and just wanted to tell you how completely satisfied I am. Huge amount of new sounds to play with, build your own drum kit approach is perfect, sample import is dead easy, you have done so many improvements to the workflow that I can‚Äôt begin to name them. Well done.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Dear Auxy Programmers and Business-Doyers <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have a long time to think about the business model of new Auxy 5.0 and my inner response to it. It is not easy to talk about it as it is right saying: yeah, we in Poland are not rich people.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed the old model, when I was able to pay several bucks for a pack of instruments once and forever. I really understand the calculation of new monthly-fee for YOUR-side conditions.<br>
However, the new model caused complete block of mine of using auxy, I‚Äôm on the crossroads - to pay or not to pay. I would like to use new features (I can use them for free for a limited time), but afterwards - I would have to stop using them, which is a pain.<br>
You should know, that there, in Poland, we have the life model: you cannot afford it - do not buy it.<br>
For our ordinary life, (you must multiply those 5 bucks by 4 or 5 to fill like a Pole). It is (5$) often 1/100 of montly income, which is not cheap. The worse is to the East from Poland (Ukraine for example).</p>
<p>The fee I could accept (to be in peace with myself) is maximum 2-3 USD for a month, which wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable for my pocket.</p>
<p>Please, take my voice into consideration.</p>
<p>I believe, that lowering monthly fee to 2 USD/month will not decrease your income as more people (including me) will buy the premium access. Also, If you set 2 USD, then We in Poland will pay about 10 PLN which is almost 3 USD (yeah, taxes, rounding the price up,  etc, as we have to pay 21 PLN now, which is over 6 bucks or a little over 5 euro) The another way is to lower yearly-fee to the 6-7 months equivalent. I would get premium at that price, which is about  1/20 of average month income, but once for a year.</p>
<p>I wish you The Best I can, because Auxy Studio is the fastest attitude for music making ever (for me especially - I do not play any instrument except the guitar) and the result is always fantastic, as you guys are <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>If you have not purchased any AP packs, the original drums will be locked. You cannot copy any legacy drum kits but they won‚Äôt disappear from the project unless they‚Äôre deleted. If you have purchased at least one AP at the current point in time you will have access to the samples at the very least. Otherwise you‚Äôre stuck with only 16 samples and whatever legacy kits you have used previously.</p>

            <p>Question, I still have not updated  but will soon. What will happen to my old drum kits? On some tracks, i use three or four different drum instruments, using only a couple hits on each one, with completely different processing. Am I going to have to search down each individual sample  and then create the right levels and sound coloring all over again? It seems like the older kids will not load in the new update, correct?</p>
<p>On the plus side I have two 4-track EP‚Äôs created entirely in Auxy that will be dropping soon.  I think the updated will probably be done after I finish this ‚Ä¶</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a>, I don‚Äôt know if you got my previous message, but I realized why I ‚Äúhated‚Äù the new version so much, and that was because I wasn‚Äôt used to it, lol. Once I started to make more and more songs with it, I found out how to make songs that sounded like my style again, and I truly value and appreciate this new update!! Thank you guys for all the hard work you do here at Auxy!!</p>

            <p>The new version is awesome and I really enjoy it.<br>
However there are some problems I think that should be fixed. And I think there‚Äôs some features that should be added at the next update.</p>
<p>The brand new design of drum track is great, but nearly all of the original presets do not have the corresponding new version of it. And the old drum tracks cannot be transformed into the new version. Some old sets are really great and some of us got used to them.  I know all the samples of it is still exist, but it takes a lot of time and effort to reorganize the set. That‚Äôs very inconvenient I think.</p>
<p>A feature that can save the preset of drum set is also needed.  It can save a lot of time. It takes a lot of time to pick and modify the samples, and it‚Äôs inconvenient to copy the drum set to another projects.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug that some of the samples have no preview sound when I selected it.</p>
<p>After all, is an amazing update and you did a great job.</p>

            <p>That‚Äôs great and all, but don‚Äôt you find it a bit unfair for users to have to buy a subscription in order to even use those types of tuned kick-drum basses when before, they didn‚Äôt have to pay at all, and they would create amazing creations? That‚Äôs just what I and one of my friends, who also uses Auxy, feel about this whole sub kick-drum thing. But, it‚Äôs whatever, you know? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/disappointed.png?v=6" title=":disappointed:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/disappointed_relieved.png?v=6" title=":disappointed_relieved:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed_relieved:"></p>

<p>Well, seeing as the drums kit mechanism is also the ‚Äòsampler‚Äô, it‚Äôs going to be used with melodic/tonal sounds too, for sure.</p>

            <p>I wasn‚Äôt referring to the piano sounds, but now that you mention it, I love how pitching up Origin produces a mandolin/guitar like sound. By the way, did N. Flyctt not actually create the soundpack? His name has been mysteriously removed from the soundpack page‚Ä¶</p>

<p>(Of course, Tuning available on melodic library sounds would be real handy too, for the same reasons.)</p>
