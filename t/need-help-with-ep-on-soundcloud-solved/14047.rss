    <title>Need help with EP on SoundCloud (SOLVED)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/need-help-with-ep-on-soundcloud-solved/14047</link>
    <description>I was trying to make an EP, and it said “something single release date”. I went and put the release date on both tracks in but it still didn’t let me make the EP for the same reason. Would appreciate any help with this.</description>

            <p>It worked now. But when I did it, it said you need to put it a release date for EP’s, even though I already put in a date. I clicked on the date, and it worked. I Think Soundcloud makes you click create twice for some reason.</p>
