    <title>Dadmother: -\//\\/- (electronic/pop/synth) [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dadmother-electronic-pop-synth-wip/15149</link>
    <description>I really love this track, and I’ve been sitting on it for quite some time. It’s pretty much to the point of completion, but I’ll still probably tinker with a few little things here and there to give it a little “something”, and I want to add some vocals to it eventually. I haven’t really thought of a name for it yet, but I’ve got a conceptual idea for it. Hope y’all dig it!
