    <title>Nano - James Lucien</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/nano-james-lucien/3918</link>
    <description>It’s been a long time since I posted a new track that wasn’t a remix. School has been busy lately and I have a special project that is eating my time away from releasing new songs. However, I have a treat here I think is ok to post. It’s literally my first ever song. Ever. It’s when Auxy was still the iPad only app. And it was awful. But I made it a little better, namely the drums weren’t completely spastic. Named after the bass used in the track, Nano.

            <p>Thanks. I wanted to keep to the style of the song which was only four parts. It actually was an entry to <span class="mention">@NYC</span>’s contest a while back which no one else entered and no results were ever given for, that’s why it doesn’t have any layers.</p>

            <p>Great job JFalc! It’s wicked and chaotic as always. I love the melodic arp at the end. Must say its pretty well composed for a first track. But thats my sauce from you, right? and of course my only tip is ﻿ｓｔａｃｋｔｈｅｌａｙｅｒｓ &lt;3</p>
