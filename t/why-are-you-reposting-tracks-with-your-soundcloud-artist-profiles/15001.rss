    <title>Why are you reposting tracks with your SoundCloud artist profiles?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/why-are-you-reposting-tracks-with-your-soundcloud-artist-profiles/15001</link>
    <description>Hey,

I use the stream view on SoundCloud to find new tracks that you guys post. Have noticed that some people repost a lot of tracks from better known artists. Not sure whether this makes sense or not? I&#39;m thinking that you either build a profile as a curator or an artist. Not both. If people follow you to hear your tracks, they don&#39;t necessarily want to hear a lot of other stuff that you happen to like. And thus you run the risk of scaring off some of your followers.

If you want to curate favorite tracks, it might be better to put these in playlists rather than reposting?

Just some food for thought...</description>

            <p>Yeah to those of you who spell your t i t l e s or n a m e s like that or put weird symbols in your titles, please stop. That makes it nearly impossible to find you with the search bar. At some point, I just give up looking. I’m sure there’s others who have the same problem. That’s a lot of listeners you could be missing out on.</p>

            <p>Tbh, I try not to follow sc pages that repost more than post original songs. For myself, I have a separate page for reposting. I only repost to my main channel if I had a hand in making the song or if I agreed with the other artist to repost trade or something like that.</p>

<p>Then maybe we use SoundCloud for different purposes or have different goals in terms of music. So again, we can agree to disagree. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>It makes sense for labels to network.<br>
That’s partly what you’re paying them for.</p>
<p>In the context of artist profiles though, I’m still not convinced it’s where I’d be spending my time/money.</p>
<p>Streaming services now account for ~75% of music industry revenue.<br>
That’s where the ‘normies’ are.</p>
<p>Spotify ads cost ~ 0.015 - 0.025c.<br>
For $250 you can get ~10,000-17,000 targeted plays.</p>
<p>I’d also argue that a Spotify ad feels far more professional than a SC repost as well…</p>

            <p>I was thinking about that earlier today and thought about changing profiles because of how I do it. I created my SC years ago and just liked songs I liked, and reposted songs I really liked, as ways to sort them. I still repost too much for my own liking, and always forget how it effects my profile from other peoples view.</p>

            <p>In my experience, you’d be hard pressed to find ways of promoting yourself to as significant of an extent as you can with repost networks. Now, I’m not advocating for this as a substitution for the other more organic types of spreading your brand, but it remains an important part of a lot of artists / labels promotional arsenals nonetheless.</p>
<p>And yes:</p>

<p>All folks I’ve spoken with that range from 5k-60k followers and that utilize repost networks as part of their growth plans. They’ve also been featured on music blogs, newsletters, and performed at / hosted various live shows across the country.</p>

            <p>repost trading doesn’t really work that well either unless both artists have a substantial amount of followers. repost networks are a lot better. i’m in a couple myself and they work really well for my music.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Very fascinating topic here (interestingly enough it also serves as the direct counterpart to <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-are-your-criteria-for-an-sc-repost-and-are-you-reposting-enough/7054">this</a> earlier post). This is something I’ve gradually shifted views on overtime but now have a fairly consistent standing on.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> put it this way before IIRC, but in my opinion at least, SoundCloud (with it’s unique hybrid nature of being both a streaming platform and social media platform) is best suited to be a resume of sorts for your musical endeavors, whether it be creation or curation. In the same way that a dubstep focused promotional page wouldn’t curate the latest in chill / ambient music, I believe that irrelevant and excessive reposts can detract from a listener’s experience of artist pages.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from mine and others experiences, I often discover new artist pages when I hear a track of theirs I like (either through SoundCloud algorithms or someone sending it to me) and thus visit their page to hear their other music. I do not personally visit their page to hear other types of music they like (or I would have just visited a radio station instead <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/yum.png?v=9" title=":yum:" class="emoji" alt=":yum:">), and though there exists a “Tracks” page to filter out reposts, I’d prefer to keep my stream rather clean and thus excessive amounts of this type of clutter can potentially discourage a follow or future visits.</p>
<p>Now this is definitely not to understate the importance and benefits of (sparingly and mindfully used) reposts. Repost trades (or repost networks on a larger scale) are an incredibly beneficial tool to introduce new audiences to your music and I’ve witnessed many examples of success that stemmed from these tools. Now, I don’t see too many people doing this around here but it’s something to consider looking into if you’re really into the curation aspect of SoundCloud.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Reposts were added to SoundCloud for a reason, it’s just in your best interest to know what effect mindfulness (or lack thereof) when reposting has on your listeners. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I personally don’t repost a track that has one good past in it. I repost a track because I feel it deserves more attention. Even if it’s from a bigger artist. I’m sure people don’t use the “repost” button the same way as the “like” button.</p>

            <p>Some people are in repost networks. They repost tracks and get theirs reposted in return. Supposed to build up their followers, but it brings in alot of people who don’t actually listen to your music anyways</p>

<p>Im not being lazy here, I just feel that Soundcloud and a lot of the people that use it see the repost button as a like button like “hey that was cool, ill repost it” instead of a “oh wow this track has done something really exceptional here.”</p>

<p>show you new music you haven’t heard of yet</p>

</aside>
<p>Which is what I use Pandora for and i feel does a much better job of.  Granted it doesn’t always show small artists, it does show me new music and artists based on what I currently like and not what somebody else i follow likes a bit and decides to repost.<br>
But to be fair you are right, soundcloud’s method isn’t perfect and isnt for everyone.  I’m not going to stop using it anytime soon for reasons as an artist, but for hitting play and just sitting back, i dont see myself using their platform for it.</p>
<p>(and yes i didn’t realize there was an update <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dj_la_rocca">@DJ_La_Rocca</a> and you Phil. I have them turned off, but it does feel a lot more clean so good job on SC)</p>

            <p>actually, repost networks are by far the most effective way to gain exposure. sure, a lot of reposts show up, but you get used to it after a while. i actually like having a lot of reposts in my stream so i can discover people i’ve never heard of before.</p>
