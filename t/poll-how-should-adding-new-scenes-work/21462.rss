    <title>Poll: How should adding new scenes work?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/poll-how-should-adding-new-scenes-work/21462</link>
    <description>As you probably have noticed, we have changed the &quot;new scene&quot; behavior to create an empty scene by default. This allows you to start &quot;blank&quot; if you want to, while you can duplicate any existing scene in case you want to start with a certain set of active loops.

However, we have been getting feedback from people who prefer the old behavior, where the currently playing loops would stay active whenever you create a new scene. Therefore, it would be great if you could share what your personal preference is.

## What should happen when you add a scene?
[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]
* Create a blank scene with no loops active
* Keep the currently playing loops active

<p>There is a flow that I would get into where I build my song parts and then make and arrangement by duplicating at the end. Maybe a way to accomplish this is with a long press option for “copy and paste at the end” in each scene while still keeping “start a new blank scene” with the plus button.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the votes so far! Seems like we should revert this behavior to how it was in previous versions.</p>
