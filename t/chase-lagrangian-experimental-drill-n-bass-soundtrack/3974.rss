    <description>Good day everyone! I&#39;m proud to present my serious song that I&#39;ve made on Auxy. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/lagrangain/chase&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. :tada: I would love to know what &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; honest opinion is on it. Furthermore, I really don&#39;t know what genre this song is other than perhaps some sort of science fiction-y soundtrack-like song. (I guess that makes sense considering my growing interest in cyberpunk.) I&#39;d love to know what your take is on that as well.</description>

            <p>I like it! You’re getting sounds out of Auxy that I’m not quite sure how you’re doing… in a good way! Overall it’s got this electronic industrial sound I’m digging. I definitely can see (hear?) the sci-fi / cyberpunk influence too.</p>
<p>Keep it up!</p>
