Another new track, but quite different to my usual style. Somewhat experimental, closer to chillhop than anything else I think, but not written specifically for the genre. Also my first ever track with actual lyrics.

It&#39;s 2am here so the track&#39;s currently got temporary artwork — will replace tomorrow when I&#39;m less tired!</description>

<p>When I first started playing Minecraft there were moments where I thought “who the hell is this, their music sounds just like mine!” That was so long ago though, musically I’ve grown a lot since then and broadened my style.</p>
<p>Another artist that I feel I have something in common with is Blue States, particularly their earlier stuff. But the stuff I’ve been doing with Auxy is quite different to the stuff I was doing in the 2000s. I discovered Blue States entirely by accident and fell in love with their stuff, but found myself at times being slightly weirded out because I could hear ideas, styles and even <em>phrases</em> from my existing tracks in their work. Not suggesting they’d stolen anything from me — a complete unknown — just a weird coincidence <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
<p>This has got me thinking, I might even dig some of my ancient songs out — I must have their MP3 files somewhere — and upload them. Most of them make me cringe, but you’ve got to know where you came from to know where you’re going (or some other such platitude).</p>

            <p>Woah. I feel like I’m in Minecraft 2. Lol JK. But it does remind me of C418 a LOT. Bits and pieces at least. Man, its so atmospheric and chill. Those drums weirdly fit so well with the song. I agree with Ice, vocals seem a bit drowned out, and the sweeper drowns almost everything else out as well when it kicks in. You should definitely experiment more with this style man. Beautiful stuff.</p>

            <p>I never even had any lessons, 100% self taught (badly). I got reasonable on the rhythm side and was starting to learn a tiny little bit of lead around the end of the 90s, then I went to university and it all went wrong: no time for guitar. Barely touched it since. Bought my steel string about 5 or 6 years with a view to getting back into it, but running a business sucks up all my time.</p>

            <p>lol I’m in the same boat. I never really LEARNED, I took like three lessons and then just played and played and played. I can’t play any songs proper, but no issues playing out guitar parts to stuff I write and overdubbing like a madman. It’s quite a bit of fun and relaxing, my second favorite instrument for sure (drums are <span class="hashtag">#1</span>)</p>

            <p>Well, I’ve just got my guitar down off the wall and given it a bath (it had about an inch of dust on it) and I’m experimenting to see if I can get the sounds down on there. If I can then I’m pretty sure that even a crap guitarist like me can create better sounds than an app using the real thing… although that’s dependent on me being able to re-learn, oh, just about everything on the guitar <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> I’ve been meaning to get back into my guitar for years anyway, maybe this is the kick up the arse that I need. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>You can’t go wrong with SoundTestRoom (Doug is the man) or Jakob Haq, who I’ve gushed over before. Both those guys just love what they do and have a great understanding of the platform.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/lowey">@lowey</a> sorry I de-railed this a bit lol. But yes, check out either Yonac’s guitar stuff (there’s also a real nice slide guitar app he’s got) and maybe even just try what’s on GarageBand, the touch instrument guitars are NOT terrible (plus, you can stack effects on them OR you can merge with an amp track  for a more “plugged in” tonality)</p>

<p>I’m totally new to Yonac, but I just grabbed the new <a href="https://youtu.be/qRZXCaBO7no" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Galileo 2 Organ app</a>, c/o a new SoundTestRoom review that just dropped.</p>
<p>I also grabbed the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rhiu7gqnPZg?t=2m46s" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ravenscroft 275 (AU3) piano app</a> that he reviewed last week. Pretty damn nice. Really high quality sounds.</p>

</aside>
<p>Acoustic drums are one option, but something primitive like an 808 or CR-78 might also be an interesting fit and bring in a slightly more welcome electronic strand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depends what you mean by construction. I wrote the lyrics and then ran it through the “say” command…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a yes. Very cool idea to go with.<br>
Adds a really interesting vibe to the piece.</p>
<p>(How does it make you feel?’ immediately sprung to mind, but there’s plenty of distance between the two tracks to make yours feel distinctly its own thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve moved this into the Work In Progress section</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to hearing the next or finished version.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Note: if/when you do switch out the midi guitar for real guitar, stick with the steel string sound. It gives it an interesting, slightly country rock/Americana tone that makes it all a little more interesting as a piece.</p>

            <p>The more I think about it, and as I receive feedback, I’m thinking this isn’t as finished as I perhaps thought at 2am this morning, so I’ve moved this into the Work In Progress section of the forum as I’ll almost certainly be revisiting it. Maybe with some fresh drums, almost certainly with new guitar, and definitely with better mixing.</p>

<p>Depends what you mean by construction. I wrote the lyrics and then ran it through the “say” command on my Mac, after picking a voice that I didn’t hate, outputting as .aiff and then converting to wav for import into Auxy.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m a big fan of AIR and would say they’re probably (one of) my biggest influences. The idea to use text-to-speech came, in fact, from How Does It Make You Feel, which used the same technique but with a different voice.</p>

            <p>Love the track. Hate the choice of kick/snare.<br>
They just seem so out of place.</p>
<p>The vibe (and composition) was decidedly non-electronic, and that was great and refreshing to hear from an Auxy track.<br>
So, it was disappointing when the hard dance kick and snare came in.</p>
<p>Love the use of text-to-speech. Was that your own construction?<br>
Really nice/cool touch.</p>
<p>The guitars feel more than a little MIDI-fied, which gives this a slight ‘draft’/rough demo feel, but otherwise a really interesting piece.</p>
<p>As for genre, it’s electronic, but in the same sense that Air is often filed under electronic, but has very present rock and pop vibes in there.<br>
With different drums, it could just as easily be an alt track on an ambient or alt/post-rock album.</p>

            <p>Yeah the tune is great I just think the Auxy guitars aren’t doing it justice, much like when someone writes a piano piece and then the Auxy pianos choke the ever loving life out of any kind of nuanced performance <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I get it’s not what they’re really for, I’m sure the intention is for them (and the guitars) to sit in a full mix but sometimes you want to just let the guitar go front and center (and I’m reasonably sure piano only pieces are not an unreasonable expectation lol…)</p>
<p>For mixing, I find the only way I get good results is through my Sennheisers. If you don’t have a good over the ear monitoring headphone (or monitors that won’t color the sound) it will be difficult. I don’t really have any iOS app recommendations for mixing its a total pain in the butt on this platform.</p>
<p>Recorded or differently sourced guitar, fix up vocal levels and tighten mix and pow! You’ll be rocking tune <em>and</em> timbre <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, in fairness the mixing across the entire track is a bit crappy. I did some tinkering in-app but couldn’t get it right. It will probably need revisiting at some point, or possibly just exporting to a different app to deal with the mixing. Anyone got any good recommendations?</p>

<p>As in a double bass? Yeah there’s some double bass in there. Since the strings pack came out I seem to have ended up with a DB in almost every track I write. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=10" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I was thinking, when I get time, I might have a bash at learning the guitar parts and then try recording them organically. Alternatively I could just look at guitar apps and redo the guitar parts there. Agreed that they could sound better, but I like the tune (if not the timbre).</p>

            <p>Definitely very different - I wish I could hear the vocals better they’re a little buried <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I like the guitar feedback sound but I think it’s a little loud, or maybe it’s just resonance.</p>
<p>Is that a stand up bass? I like it, fits nicely. Would LOVE to hear what this would sound like with not Auxy guitars because the sounds were a cool addition, but they just don’t pass muster as a leading instrument… no fault of your own, just how the sample set ends up sounding.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s good! I’m on my fifth or so listen I do have a feeling I’m going to be humming the melody later. It’s got a very ethereal feel to it</p>

<p>Another new track, but quite different to my usual style. Somewhat experimental, closer to chillhop than anything else I think, but not written specifically for the genre. Also my first ever track with actual lyrics.</p>
<p>It’s 2am here so the track’s currently got temporary artwork — will replace tomorrow when I’m less tired!</p>
