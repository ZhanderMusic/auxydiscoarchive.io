            <p>I’m an indifferent  pacifist <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"> I do hate school but not as much as I hate guns. As for the art, it’s open for interpretations it’s just meaningless absurdity. As for the harsh vibes, I blame the heavy electronics I listen too, kind of numbs one to abrasive noises.

            <p>Like the tracks.<br>
Hard listening, at points. But interesting, well-made – and <span class="bbcode-u">new</span>.</p>
<p>Like the artwork too. The music + artwork gives off a certain ‘school shooter’ vibe. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>A playlist on SoundCloud? Keep in mind I don’t own a computer so I’m a bit restricted. Just a phone and an iPad is how I roll.</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br>
Oh, I thought about making a playlist or something along those lines but alas that thought came after I had already uploaded.<br>
I’m not the smartest when it comes to this series of tubes that others surf easily and care free.<br>
As for the songs being all different I was just trying to figure out what my sound works best as.m, see what folks enjoy from me I guess.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what order your series belongs in and I just wanna point out that you can make different kinds of playlists in order to help the listen experience your songs in the way you intent. Just getting around to listening to it now and your tracks are as different and interesting as ever.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I think it came out well. Hopefully sometime next week I’m going to put up a track or two of my non Auxy stuff. What I would call Terror Drone if I had to give the sound a name. Mainly using analog synths, sometimes 60 bpm’s isn’t slow enough.</p>

            <p>Thanks man that’s means a lot. My art and music are kind of the same in that I just want to create things I’ve not seen or heard everywhere.<br>
Do I succeed? Not usually but that’s art I suppose.</p>
