            <p>May I suggest lowering the volume on the high pitched tones. They strike hard in that upper register. Also the song needs to be more coherent with obvious queues in terms of transitions between verse and chorus EX: A B A B. If you are going to do a drop to the chorus, maybe add more bass into that scene or something else that can lure in the listener. A bit repetitive the melody. Try changing up the notes a bit. Give variation to the chorus. Your song is really good but can be better with some tweaks.</p>
<p>Also bring out the chords more. They sound like background noise at times.</p>

            <p>Can you point out where you think automation should be better used in transitions? Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks, man. I’ll look into the feedback. But, what do you mean the chords aren’t “strong”? Also, the bass would probably pop without headphones, because I’m not a very bassy person. Also, the second drop isn’t the exact same as the first. They have the same melody and everything, but they are set up completely differently. Again, thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I agree that it is repetitive and that is something I try to work on, it’s my biggest issue imo. I don’t really agree with there’s not being enough bass, though, because if there were more bass, then it would take from the melody and chords. I think the bass was perfectly fine. Also, what do you mean it could use a bit of automation? I’ve got plenty of automation.</p>

            <p>I’m not wearing headphones.</p>
<p>Okay, starting out, chords are a bit too high and strong.<br>
beat is nice. snare could use a little work<br>
the buildup is very strong I like it.<br>
the drop is a little disappointing. not enough Bass.<br>
part after drop is good but is pretty much the same as the buildup.<br>
the second drop is exactly the same as the first one.</p>
<p>This clearly is a good song with a lot of effort put into it. I like it but I’m just going to say it’s a bit repetitive and does not have enough clear bass. Also could use a bit of automation.</p>
