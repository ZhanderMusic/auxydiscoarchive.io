    <title>[POLL] Do you export to WAV or M4A?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/poll-do-you-export-to-wav-or-m4a/10591</link>
    <description>Curious to know how users prefer to export their Auxy tracks.

Do you typically export as Uncompressed WAV or as 128 kbps M4A (using the Export Audio option)?

[poll type=regular]
* _Always_ WAV
* _Usually_ WAV
* About the same
* _Usually_ M4A
* _Always_ M4A

<p>Assuming you’re uploading a good master, the resultant audio quality of your SC tracks will sound no worse than others on there. So, it’s kind of a level playing field as far as the impact of audio quality on audience appeal goes.</p>

            <p>They’re gonna be doing compression undoubtedly also, so if you’re exporting to M4A and then uploading there (and it’s getting compressed again) then you could experience more loss of the audio quality - but, just to re-iterate, if your ears are satisfied with what you hear (quality, volume, presence etc) then it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>It’s like someone can look at a Picasso or Rembrandt, and think it’s awesome, and then another person can look at the same painting and think it’s a total pile of garbage. It’s not like this compression is going to affect the track in such a way that suddenly it’s downsampled to 4 bits and 11khz like a bit crusher effect…</p>
<p>But, this is just my 2¢</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t worry too much, it really depends on what you’re doing with what you export. If I wasn’t exporting and then running the mix through Grand Finale, truth told, I’d probably just export directly to SoundCloud. If you’re happy with the mix and how it sounds, don’t worry about it. Our ears are the final arbiter.</p>
<p>For people who want to bring stems into another app, or a desktop DAW, the obvious choice is to export them uncompressed with no other “Auxy sauce mastering effects.” You’d want the cleanest, most un-adultered version of the audio you could get so that when you bring it into your app of choice it’s the best quality possible.</p>

            <p>I would agree, but the poll results seem to show that the WAV is the more popular option – whether that’s direct upload to SC or exporting the Uncompressed WAV.<br>
Fewer users seem to make use of the lower quality M4A versions, so it doesn’t quite match up to the JPG vs. RAW comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have slow internet and it uploads waaaay to fast to be wav files. I’m pretty sure their smaller files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renders are required for the SC upload option to be available and <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/post-your-great-auxy-feature-idea-here/1129/243">renders are uncompressed WAV</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you’re going to scare users who are new to this information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s definitely worth every Auxy user knowing the difference between lossy and lossless formats.<br>
(The app doesn’t disclose that info, so it’s good if the community educates its members.)</p>
<p>Besides, according to Lenberg, <em><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/potential-bias-in-reposting-tracks/61/181">“It’s not a beginner app.”</a></em></p>
<p>If it’s not a beginner app, then popular, pro-quality options shouldn’t be bumped to a secondary menu.</p>

            <p>omg you’re going to scare users who are new to this information <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/speak_no_evil.png?v=5" title=":speak_no_evil:" class="emoji" alt=":speak_no_evil:"></p>
<p>guys (newer to file management) as long as you’ve hopefully saved your project files you’re good because then you could export them as wavs later on for purposes resulting in higher quality… If not don’t worry. I have 5 megapixel JPEG images I have taken long ago on my iPhone 4 that have great value even now when we have much greater quality images surrounding us. As long as you have your music, in whatever quality you’re good, but of course for future reference do your best to maintain the projects for higher quality file exports <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/heart.png?v=5" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:">️</p>

            <p>I think the uncompressed wav option is fine where it’s at, people who have a use for the higher quality will typically know what it’s for and those who don’t may not even have the need for such a large file because they wouldn’t even care for the benefit provided by such a file. It’s good to educate people on what it is though so i’m glad this was brought up. It’s like in the photography world where you only use JPEG (kinda like music’s MP3/M4A) then you learn what RAW is (like music’s uncompressed wav) and you then switch to RAW for master images and JPEG for public files. Where photos and photo files originate- in retouching or even the camera settings (kinda equivalent to production apps) TIFF/DNGs, which are closest to original RAW files, are saved within the same option lists that you could save JPEGs in so I think it’s fine.</p>

            <p>I think you’re right. I probably should have included SoundCloud as an option in the poll as many will be using it without knowing (and maybe not caring) which format it exports as or ends up as. So, in that sense, it does stand alone and doesn’t cleanly correlate to choosing ‘Uncompressed WAV’, as you say.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my original post is an attempt to do a few things…</p>
<ul>
<li>Better understand who’s exporting as ‘Audio’ (M4A) and why?</li>
<li>To check my assumption that fewer users choose ‘Audio’/M4A compared to other options for exporting the entire track</li>
<li>Make a case for moving ‘Uncompressed WAV’ to the first set of menu options.</li>
</ul>

            <p>You can’t export a file simply by tapping a button labelled ‘Export’.</p>
<p>You’ve been making a second, specific menu selection: ‘Audio’, ‘SoundCloud’, Export Individual Instruments’ or ‘Uncompressed WAV’.</p>

            <p>This is a great point, but my point would be that most would use the “upload to SoundCloud” option, where the end result is opus, rather than using the export wav option, and therefore would be counted as an option different from WAV.</p>
<p>The “Upload to SoundCloud” option is different than the “Uncompressed WAV” option.</p>

            <p>As <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/blakkaz">@blakkaz</a> says, an uncompressed upload format means the cleanest end results.<br>
Uploading a lossy, compressed format, (e.g. MP3, M4A/AAC,…), means it’s effectively being run through two, independent lossy compression processes, which does two rounds of damage.</p>
