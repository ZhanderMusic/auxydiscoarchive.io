    <title>How has Auxy changed you?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-has-auxy-changed-you/3041</link>
    <description>The app really has changed how I view music. It turned it from a class into an art form for me and really helped me to express ideas that needed expressing. It acts as a very convenient creative outlet for me, and has really helped me get my ideas out there. It is also nice to get feedback on your creative ideas, so you can keep improving your work. So I ask the question -

            <p>I still remember back in the days where I wrote my music with pencil and sheet music. Yes! I made my first song when I was 9 year old with pen and paper! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/see_no_evil.png?v=9" title=":see_no_evil:" class="emoji" alt=":see_no_evil:"></p>
<p>I have tried Sibelius at high school, finally something makes a sound when I entered notes into the computer. Lol</p>
<p>After I started working I bought Reason but never got into it due to the complicity of the functions <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/scream.png?v=9" title=":scream:" class="emoji" alt=":scream:"> the music class never taught us the modern music production side of music.</p>
<p>About 5 months ago I found Auxy, it was life changing! I can literally compose music anywhere, it’s so easy! I even composed some music sitting in the toilet <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was into EDM and Future Bass before, then I slowly grew to enjoy Hip Hop as well. I thought the beats and the vibes the songs send were something worth making and sharing, and I needed a program on my iPad to create them. Auxy made all of this possible. I did and still do make other genres of electronic music because of this app, but I feel that Auxy opened the doors to the Hip Hop genre as well. And that’s what I’m focusing on now.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was interested in electronic music ever since I turned nine. I used to love the old Marshmello and Alan Walker, and then I backed away from that and listened to trap a lot when I was ten. Then I found MusicMakerJam, a mixing software where you could mix loops and post it to the community. This was my first baby step. I slowly digressed from the app and found Auxy. At first, I was pretty garbage, but after practicing and sitting down in front of this app for long periods of time. It took me about two years to find out what my style/styles were (about like a few months ago). I fell in love with making Wonky, Drum and Bass, and various types of House. And here I am now :P. If it weren’t for this app, I would not have been so engrossed in music, and it taught me a lot from automations and chord progressions. I’m now starting to learn piano and hopefully I can learn more about music and notes that I put into my work and imply that into my songs.</p>

            <p>Now I’m capable of sharing my emotions and feelings to anyone in the form of music and all the credit goes to Auxy and it’s developers <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fredrik">@fredrik</a> for such an amazing app.<br>
Auxy has true potential to become best DAW on iOS and App is stepping higher and higher in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also, ONE TRUE FACT<br>
I don’t like iOS and it’s Closed Source Environment at all<br>
Even then I bought iPhone and this year iPad only to use Auxy and I swear it’s 100% true that the priority was Auxy when buying iOS Devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/point_up/4.png?v=6" title=":point_up:t4:" class="emoji" alt=":point_up:t4:">One More Fact,<br>
I have all the stable Auxy App version’s copy starting from version 1.1 to v5.3.0</p>

            <p>Ah these aren’t bad - the second one especially. That said I think your newer stuff is awesome too, which is pretty impressive considering there is a monumental difference between Auxy and Reason.</p>
