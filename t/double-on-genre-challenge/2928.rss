    <title>Double on Genre Challenge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/double-on-genre-challenge/2928</link>
    <description>Hi! If you watch Andrew Huang on YouTube, you’ll notice that he made lots of double on genre videos. Double on Genre is basically two genres combined into one track. So i’m like, “Wow, this is a brilliant idea!” I think this will be a good challenge in Auxy. I’m doing this challenge monthly.

This month’s challenge is Dark + Pop. Dark is because this month is October where Haloween is happening and pop is because it’s unusual to hear a dark pop.

So, do your best for this challenge and it’s just for fun.</description>
