    <title>Soundcloud Glitches</title>

    <description>Not sure what category to put this in, but...
My Soundcloud has been glitching **A Lot**.
And I know there isn&#39;t really anything you guys can do but maybe some of you are also experiencing this and also I thought I&#39;d just tell you.
This is a picture from a message conversation. This is what it claims how long ago each message was sent. It&#39;s supposed to make the oldest at the top, and that is what it did, but the timing was very off.

Whenever I write a comment it says I wrote it 37 minutes ago, but whenever someone else writes a comment, it was written 36 minutes ago. Above is a picture of a comment which happened within a minute. And just for the record, the comment I replied to was not written 36 minutes ago. It had just been written.

And apparently the oldest comment on this track was written &#39;Just now ago&#39;. You can also see that the comment above it was written a month ago. This has happened many times for me, putting the comments in the order they were written but reversing the dates.

Anyway, just thought I&#39;d let you know

            <p>A few people here have had that message suddenly start appearing today.</p>
<p>I suspect there’s a problem going on with SC’s service.</p>
<p>You might see something mentioned on their Twitter feed, if it’s widespread.</p>
