    <title>Indigoo - Remix Megamix! [Idea, WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indigoo-remix-megamix-idea-wip/5469</link>
    <description>So I was thinking today, and I had an idea:
The Remix Mega Mix!
Essentially what this is is I make a ton of short (1 - 2 minute) remixes of songs, and compile them together to create a giant 8 minute long track! (Or something like that) 
Obviously, I can’t make this giant track using just Auxy, so I will be using Djay to compile the tracks.
I made this topic for people to share their opinion on this idea, give some feedback, or maybe if I can’t find enough tracks to remix, submit some to be in this.
Thanks guys!
