    <description>Few words about: **absolutely final** version of my latest track **Ground Pepper**, I have posted previous versions in WIP section few days ago, these are older versions - with some major changes, so there is need for two separate posts - about work in progress and the final track.

[Click here to listen **final version of Ground Pepper** by thomasonline.pl, long edit [upbeat, nuJazz, indie IDM] on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/thomasonline-633982140/ground-pepper-final-long-ver)

**Title**: Ground Pepper (final, long edit)

**genere**: Alternative electronic, experimental, nuJazz, jazztronica, breakbeat, upbeat, nu funk

**tempo**:
160 BPM

Made with: Auxy Mobile Studio,
samples cut with Edity, Hokusai2

**About track**: It&#39;s not another standard synth pop or electronic flick. Here at Ground Pepper especialy in FINAL long version Auxy meets nuJazz. Groovey, funky, fat bass, floating beat, spacious leads, and chopped vocal elements with trumpet together forming melody.

**About me**: 
![image|502x500](upload://eraeSFrDaLg5inlkFnX9x09bOuN.jpeg) 
I am art director and graphic designer who after hours spends quite some time writing producing music. Also in my early twenties I was a DJ playing mostly in OFF/Alternative clubs mostly DnB and early Glitch. Some time ago I have used Propellerheads Reason, now it is Auxy Music Studio. My ambition is -making it all by myself, without using any ready to use loops. All my track are made/written note by note if there are any longer samples used they are only addition to main part of a track which is created from first notes by me. I think as for someone without formal music education it&#39;s quite something. I have learned everything by myself often by deconstruction and analyzing my favourite songs and tracks. When it comes to what I am listening it&#39;s quite wide range from Jazz to alternative electronic music. Medeski Martin and Wood, Tied and Tickled Trio, Avishai Cohen, Exploding Plastics, Skalpel, Cinematic Orchestra, Lorn, Lapalux, Koan Sound, Dj Shadow, Two Fingers and many mamy other...
