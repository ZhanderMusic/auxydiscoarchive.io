            <p>I know this is a little late, but I think your job sounds awesome! Me and my friends volenteer at our church on Wednesday nights, except it isn’t your normal church service. It’s just for teenagers and we don’t have normal worship songs, we have fast paced pop and edm sounding tracks with Christian lyrics sung to them. (Although it does slow down later and then we have an actual message) As you can imagine, such energetic songs would require some energetic lights and sounds. Me and my friends run the lights and sound there, and I’ve been learning the basics of production. It’s deffinitly something I’d want to do when I grow up, and I just thought it’s cool to meet someone who does legit lights and sound for legit concerts and wanted to share that with you.</p>
<p>Also, our church made a new song with a sick beat to it, and they asked me if I would like to remix it for them. I should be releasing it within the next month or so.</p>

House parties are private events.<br>
