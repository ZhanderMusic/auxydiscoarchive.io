    <title>Fly - Winter J. Studios</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/fly-winter-j-studios/14964</link>
    <description>Woah... it’s been a very long time since I’ve posted. Huh... well I got a very awesome new track right now! Go check it out! Please give feedback if you’d like to see what I should improve on or just a complement in general! 

Also I’ve missed on a lot of things since last year. Just starting to use Auxy again. 

Soundcloud: [Fly - Winter J. Studios](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/fly-winter-j-studios)

I’m also changing my name soon so I’ll start using Winter J. Studios instead of what I have now.

Glad to be back! ^-^</description>
