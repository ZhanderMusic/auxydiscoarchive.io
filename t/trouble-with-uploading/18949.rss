    <description>I’ve been sending tracks and wips to some artists for feedback and some of them do not except M4As. So I try to upload an MP3 but it’s still an M4A. And uncompressed wav. probably wouldn’t work either, and I have tried that as well. How would I be able to send an MP3 without sending an M4A?</description>

            <p>Sending a .wav should be fine.  If they’re using FL, i’d assume they’re on pc, so yes an m4a wont work natively without a converter.  which is probably why they’re asking for an mp3.  but idk why they wouldn’t ask for a .wav because that’s compatible too and at much higher quality.</p>

            <p>I don’t know why someone would want to use an mp3 to sample into a track. The editing process destroys the integrity of the audio file. Sending an uncompressed WAV is 100% your best bet. If they don’t accept WAV files, they are seriously fighting a losing battle with their sampling choices.</p>

            <p>Weird, ok. I mean yeah FL will ingest MP3s but I’ve never heard of anyone wanting to use MP3s as material for tracks… final export, sure. But not for arrangement etc.</p>

            <p>Why would they only accept lossy MP3? That’s crazy.</p>
<p>Uncompressed wave will output a nice 16bit, 44khz .wav file, no loss.</p>
<p>You can’t really convert stuff to MP3 on iOS anyway, there may be apps that do it but nothing I’m aware of or use personally.</p>
