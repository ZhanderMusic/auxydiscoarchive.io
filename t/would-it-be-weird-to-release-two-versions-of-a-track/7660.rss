    <title>Would it be weird to release two versions of a track?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/would-it-be-weird-to-release-two-versions-of-a-track/7660</link>
    <description>I’m currently working on a track Oper&amp; (Operand), and I started to work on a second mix of it. The second mix had the same basic tune and everything, with some slight structural changes and it’s in a different key (I changed up some sounds and little tunes too, it’s like a small remix). The second one is more of a ‘dance mix’ if you will. Do you think it would be weird if I released both versions when I finished them?</description>

            <p>What that would be is a VIP mix. And there’s nothing wrong with a VIP mix. I’ve done it before as well, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/sets/dense-anthology-1" rel="nofollow noopener">twice for the same song</a> xD Plenty of big name artists do this, including those in the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/southborne/in-the-night-vip-mix1" rel="nofollow noopener">Auxy community</a> (<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a>)</p>
<p>I’d say release them a bit spaced out, maybe a month or so. VIP means Variation in production, which means things like different keys, structural workarounds, that sort of thing.</p>

            <p>When artist do that it’s generally called a VIP. They have the original and the altered version released as separate tracks.</p>

            <p>Yeah now that I think about it, deadmau5 did something like that recently, two tracks were based off of the same melody, however they were pretty much completely different tracks. I guess it just feels weird because both are very similar in my case?</p>

            <p>I’m currently working on a track Oper&amp; (Operand), and I started to work on a second mix of it. The second mix had the same basic tune and everything, with some slight structural changes and it’s in a different key (I changed up some sounds and little tunes too, it’s like a small remix). The second one is more of a ‘dance mix’ if you will. Do you think it would be weird if I released both versions when I finished them?</p>
