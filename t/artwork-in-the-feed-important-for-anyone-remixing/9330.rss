    <title>Artwork in the feed [IMPORTANT for anyone remixing]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/artwork-in-the-feed-important-for-anyone-remixing/9330</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve already said a million times that you NEED to actually change projects you find in the feed for them to be a remix and not plagiarism. Hopefully people should know that by now. However, people seem to think they get the full rights to the song if it&#39;s in the feed.
(Spoiler alert: YOU DON&#39;T)
Guys, you have the right to upload your adaptions of people&#39;s work under the liscense their posted under, but that does NOT work if you don&#39;t actually alter the project OR EVEN USE THE ARTWORK. Even if you apply a bunch of filters on it; it is still copyrighted and you do not have the rights to use it. The artwork is not part of the project. The artwork is not for you to use. If you ask the artist, they might give it to you. But you can&#39;t just use it like that.

I&#39;ll just make it clear. YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ANY ARTWORK IN THE FEED.

Thanks for your time.

            <p>Yeah guys, great point here. It’s just a basic thing that goes with being a good artist. You want respect? Treat other people’s work with respect- gotta understand the difference between plag and tasty remixin’</p>

<p>What always happens.</p>
<p>Guys, if you want to use the artwork, I’d recommend getting into contact with the creators to see if they will let you. I am very grateful to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/austin_haga">@aUstin_Haga</a> for allowing me to utilize the official artwork for the mashup epic mix of Float, Changes and P O W I did a while back, and the same for Singularity as well (Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/produk">@Produk</a> for letting me do that as well).</p>
<p><strong>If you aren’t sure, then ask.</strong></p>
