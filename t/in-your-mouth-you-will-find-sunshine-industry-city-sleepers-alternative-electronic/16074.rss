Infoz: I was inspired by a picture my son brought home from school and was playing around with some of the new features that are coming imminently. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve released anything (though plenty of things have been started) so it&#39;s been nice to get this little jam together, wrap it up and get it out the door.

Thanks all :)</description>
