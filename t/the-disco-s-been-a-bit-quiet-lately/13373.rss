Hello! Sorry to bother you, but I’ve been thinking... the old notification for the Disco in the in-app news for Auxy is long gone. It seems like there are tons of people regularly using Auxy, but nothing is bringing new people into the community.

So I was thinking, why not a little news notification? It would probably bring us new people, and even fill up @DHO’s tournament bracket a bit!</description>
