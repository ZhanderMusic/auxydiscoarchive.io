    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/today-s-rap-music-depresses-me/7510</link>
    <description>i usually act like i like today’s rappers such as uzi and even older ones like travis scott but honestly i don’t... i miss the rap from two to three years ago... that’s where my fondest memories come from, that’s my childhood, and that music back then has meaning... i was going back and listening to some of the stuff i liked back then and it hit me... even yachty’s verse on i spy about “balls in his nutsack” has more meaning than half of the music today... i love kyle’s music and the weeknd’s music for this exact reason... it shows emotion, it shows feeling, and most of all, it takes actual work to make it. none of you know this, but i’m also an aspiring rapper... i was writing something today and i challenged myself to not use anything that didn’t have meaning... that was honestly really hard to do... today’s rappers bypass that by just talking about drugs, sex, and watches, which is pathetic. i guess i’m just saying that i really miss when rap could be happy and make you feel good, when it had an actual meaning behind the lyrics... i want your opinions on this. tell me what you think. i know most of you don’t listen to rap, so i have a few songs for you to listen to to get you acquainted with the genre. the meaningful songs are “kyle - doubt it” (or i spy, either one is really good but i spy has a verse from lil yachty and that part of it is trash) and “the weeknd - die for you.” the new, trashy music is “lil pump - designer” and “lil uzi vert - for real.”

again, let me know your opinions on this because it can’t just be me that thinks this.</description>

<p>On Spotify or wherever you can, check out BROCKHAMPTONs newest album “iridescence”<br>
The first song is called New Orleans and listening to it in order it goes into the next song called “THUG LIFE”. The transition into each other is amazing.</p>
<p>BROCKHAMPTON is the most popular rap that I’ve listened to recently, but these I have listed are some of my favorites on sound cloud. They are different based off of what you said you like, but they are hip-hop/rap. Also I highly encourage you to check out each artist’s page and hear their other tracks.</p>

            <p>Honestly though. I have a strong dislike most of today’s rap songs. Most of them use almost the same drum beat in every song. And the lyrics aren’t even creative. They are just people talking about money, sex, drugs, and about how good they are at everything. Of course though, our community is a little more creative than that.</p>

<p>I haven’t listened very carefully (or very much) to this guy but my first impression wasn’t actually terrible. The production is pretty (relatively) professional — and while I don’t really get much meaning out of the lyrics, the rhymes aren’t bad &amp; struck me as being a lot more like real <em>rap</em> than mumble rap or whatever seems to be getting good stats lately.</p>
<p>Again, just a first impression. Have not really looked into it or listened much</p>

            <p>well people kept giving him garbage for “changing his style” and wanting to be more Marshall.  So he was kinda forced to go back to his Slim Shady side; a part of it calling and name dropping people.</p>
<p>Still better than people mumblin <em>something something</em> Got that Ice <em>something something</em> all these ho ho ho’s</p>

            <p>Em is a great lyricist and all, but I just hate how he dissed like 30 people on his new album. Like, that wasn’t necessary, and he dissed everyone who didn’t like Revival, because the majority of people “haven’t heard it”. Honestly it’s just a crap album, and he’s being a little kid about it. Em is still king tho after that MGK crap.</p>
