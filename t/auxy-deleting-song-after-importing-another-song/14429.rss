    <title>Auxy Deleting Song After Importing Another Song</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-deleting-song-after-importing-another-song/14429</link>
    <description>So I don&#39;t know if this fits in this category. I was working on a song for a few hours and was sent a project link after opening said link and importing that song my other song that I had worked on vanished/reset. I&#39;ve lost hours of work and would like to know if there&#39;s a way to get it back.</description>

            <p>My friend had this happen to them recently as well, it seems to be a really rare and specific bug. I’ll try to recreate the situation, as I’ve always had some glitchy shenanigans happen whenever I open a project up from a link for the first time in a while.</p>

            <p>It’s not in the backups. I checked that. It reset the project to one loop and the rest is gone (which was a lot since i was almost done with the song) But thank you, I’ll probably try to reach support.</p>

            <p>Probably best to contact support (don’t have my device handy believe it’s <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a>).</p>
<p>The stuff you were working on isn’t in the backup section/folder?</p>
