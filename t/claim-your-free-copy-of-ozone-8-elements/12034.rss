    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/claim-your-free-copy-of-ozone-8-elements/12034</link>
    <description>For all of you Auxy users out there that export to a major DAW, you can get a free copy of Ozone 8 Elements from Plugin Boutique. It’s an industry standard mastering software, but it’s also the lite version, you can upgrade to the full version with more features for cheap later. You will need to subscribe to the newsletter and purchase any product at Plugin Boutique, including any of their $1 deals. https://www.pluginboutique.com/articles/1392
It’s legit and well worth it for me. You will recieve the code within 24 hours.</description>

  <blockquote>
    I figured this could be an interesting post for people to mention Plugins/VST’s/AU’s etc. for people around here that don’t just use Auxy.  It’s generally hard to find good plugins to use (other than the obvious ones like serum n stuff) more so lower cost ones for people just starting with other DAW’s. 
things to maybe mention when posting: 
-mac, windows or both 
-uses/what kind of plugin is it (effect, instrument, add’l tools etc) 
-price 
-website or link to product
