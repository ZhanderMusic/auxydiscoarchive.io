    <title>What was your first Auxy Track?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-was-your-first-auxy-track/2974</link>
    <description>So everyone has to start from somewhere. Some of us started very recently, and some might have been doing this for as long as Auxy has existed.

Anyways, the point of this topic:
Post your FIRST ever track here!
If you want to, also put a link to your most recent track. It’ll be inspiring especially for producers that are not so experienced... like me, to see what kind of progress is possible to achieve.

Again, post your first and your most recent track here!</description>

            <p>The original project was made in early 2017 when I was introduced to the world of music. I tried to remake the song as best I could.<br>

            <p>I know this is off topic, but I recently wanted to revisit your masterpiece and discovered it was no longer on soundcloud.<br>
I really loved the Devil’s Hours so is there, perhaps, a way I could listen to it again?</p>
