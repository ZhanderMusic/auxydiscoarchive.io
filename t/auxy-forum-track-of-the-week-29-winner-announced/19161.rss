    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-29-winner-announced/19161</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**

&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt; * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt; * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**

&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**

One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. The judges alternate between: - 

* iammane
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @MrSerpent 

**‚ìürize**

* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 

* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Lotta competition between these tracks! Each of you brought something unique to the table and should be proud of yourselves.</p>
<p>I gotta say, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/paroxyzm">@paroxyzm</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paroxyzm-music/system-malfunction" rel="nofollow noopener">system malfunction</a> was immensely enjoyable and ends up taking the cake for me. Check out the rest of his album <a href="https://soundcloud.com/paroxyzm-music/sets/cosmic-romance" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/misterserpent/sets/auxy-track-of-the-week-29/s-C6mwiTzNgLd" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> to check the rest of the submissions out (highly recommended!)</p>
<p>Alright that‚Äôs it for week 29. Was a little busy over the weekend so this is coming in a little late but I had a great time listening and there were highlights in every track. Keep at it!</p>
