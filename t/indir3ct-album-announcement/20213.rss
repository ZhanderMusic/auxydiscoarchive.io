    <title>INDIR3CT - Album/ Announcement</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indir3ct-album-announcement/20213</link>
    <description>Hey all, just thought I&#39;d pop in say hey. Life has been pretty hectic recently, to say the least. On top of that I had an issue with recovering my iPad and iCloud and lost a good amount of projects.. but oh well. I got a few back in the recovery, file links, friends, etc. 

I hope everyone is doing good and saying safe during this pandemic. I don&#39;t really have any new tracks because of loosing my projects, so I&#39;ve been going back and collecting half decent private uploads. I got enough to compile a small album/EP starting with my most recent finished track I got back, [Isolate](https://soundcloud.com/indir3ct/isolate), and some other projects I got together Including an old collaboration with Phluze. Sorry these tracks aren&#39;t touched up at all, but I thought I&#39;d give you guys something. It has a few tracks I&#39;ve (tried to) finish over the past year and a half. This track has all sorts of genres like synth wave, trap, glitch hop/house, and future bass. So a little out of my comfort zone but... still incorporating my own style.

Anywho I&#39;ll be taking a break form music production for a while, but Ill try to stay somewhat active on here and Soundcloud. 

Hope everyone is having a good day, and stay safe :v:</description>

            <p>The latest beat I uploaded days ago is a part of the album too, so yeah. Also btw, I just finished the second one. 3 more to go! (I might delete some of my songs that cringe me in the meantime)</p>
