    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-21-winner-announced/17313</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* :icsleepers: ICSleepers 
* :arimyth: Arimyth
* :hydrans: Hydrans
* :azureonyx: AzureOnyx
* :goxenar:  Goxenar
* :blakkaz: Blakaz
* :dadmother: DadMother
* :janitor: MisterMaster

Judge this week is: @Goxenar  

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/traverse">@traverse</a>,  I finally got some time to listen to your Drum and Bass track properly.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not the judge for week 21, but I like your background arpeggios, the pitch transitions and the DnB beats.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs very quiet this week.</p>
<p>Dadmother - Your track‚Äôs a classic, but, rule <span class="hashtag">#6</span> - No remixes.</p>
<p>Aadam - Rule 4 - Your track was posted a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Which leaves <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/traverse">@traverse</a> as last man standing.</p>
<p>Drageonix gets Track of the Week and I haven‚Äôt even listened to it yet!</p>
<p>Goxenar - no judging for you this week!</p>
