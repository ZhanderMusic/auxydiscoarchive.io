    <title>Thoughts on spammers?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/thoughts-on-spammers/15212</link>
    <description>Some of you may have come across comments of people promoting their music, art, business, or other things in comment sections or dms. This is called spam. 
Some other examples of spam include:
- Following thousands of people so that some you follow notice your account
- Liking all of someone&#39;s posts for a possible shout out
- Over generic comments for attention (its obvious when you just posted it and they comment 3 seconds after the post was created)(sometimes they are not a spammer)

What are your thoughts on spam?</description>

            <p>being part of repost networks gets you a whole lot of exposure, so having your page flooded with reposts is a price you might have to pay to get your music out there… trust me, i know from experience. i don’t like having my page flooded with reposts, but it’s one of the only ways my music gets heard by people</p>

            <p>Yes, but the first impression still matters. A cluttered profile can immediately steer someone away. I usually do go to ‘tracks’, however my opinion on reposting still stands. If you’re forcing people to go to ‘tracks’ to hear their work, then the tons of reposts aren’t really doing much… just making it harder to access their work. If there’s only the occasional repost, it’s fine - it shows that you really value a track. But once it gets excessive, there’s no point. If people want your work, they’re gonna go to the tracks tab and ignore the reposts. Which sorta defeats the purpose of reposting: showing off a track and exposing new people to it.</p>

            <p>A few reposts is completely fine! I have a few, one of which is a collaboration that I participated in anyway. I’m just saying that reposts should be kept minimal and exclusive. For those people who repost stuff as if it’s just the like button, consider this - by doing that, you’re REALLY not helping the artist get exposure. What’s the point in reposting their work if it’s buried among your other 359 reposts? The repost loses its significance, it doesn’t really mean as much anymore. Make your reposts a ‘premium’ so to speak. Make them uncommon, so that when you actually repost something, more people can see it, AND give the artist more of a sense of pride if they check your profile and see that you liked their work enough to repost it - and then see that you don’t repost often, showing them how much you value their work. Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Also - just a general tip to everyone: if you’re trying to get noticed by other people and possibly get more followers, you should NOT have a page that is absolutely flooded with reposts. If I go to someone’s page and the first stuff I see isn’t theirs, I usually won’t go through the effort to find their work unless I really feel like it. First impressions matter. When I go to your profile, I wanna see your work. Not someone else’s. Don’t get me wrong - A few very occasional reposts is ok, but I don’t wanna be FLOODED with them (some profiles I go to have like 25 reposts for every 1 track they have, so they have like 10 tracks hidden among 250 reposts). I want your work. And if I can see your work easily and quickly, and it’s easy for me to listen to your work, I’m more likely to possibly follow you, and also less likely for me to mistake you for a reposting account. Your profile should be a portfolio of your work to show off to others. It should convince them that you are worth following. If you really wanna repost tons of stuff and you don’t wanna make a second account, please just make a playlist. I don’t want to litter my feed with what the people I follow like. I want my feed to be their music. Sorry for that rant. I just see this WAY too often and it really bugs me.</p>
