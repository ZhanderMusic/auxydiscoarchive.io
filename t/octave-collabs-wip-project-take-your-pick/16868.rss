    <title>Octave [Collabs? WIP, Project, Take your pick]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/octave-collabs-wip-project-take-your-pick/16868</link>
    <description>So I’ve been in hospital for the past week and have little energy for creativity. I have made some very basic ideas for future tracks if anyone wants to collab. I’ll only be doing 1 or 2 at a time, if interested, take your pick.

Proj1: https://app.auxy.co/projects/xJXzbiAnKliRfmP3oktlSg==

Proj2: https://app.auxy.co/projects/Vnm8GkrjBKEe7ZueEqCGmQ==

Proj3: https://app.auxy.co/projects/Wuq3t-3JiGV0yi9-tpr0SQ==

Proj4: https://app.auxy.co/projects/i12nFfvrMbobi78zgb2pYg==

Proj5: https://app.auxy.co/projects/qh8f3gEnS9WtTZvzEq-zOA==

Note: I like my tracks simply structured and very melodic so keep that in mind. Also very influenced by Avicii.

            <p>All of the tracks are nice but I would be most interested in collating in project 1 if you’d like. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
