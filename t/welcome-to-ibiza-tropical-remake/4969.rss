    <title>Welcome To Ibiza-Tropical Remake</title>

    <description>Hello to all! I have finally posted a new song! 

After three weeks since I haven‚Äôt posted a song, here it is! I‚Äôve tried to look at other users tracks to see what I‚Äôm missing to get better at making my tracks but I think I‚Äôll get there one day.

I‚Äôll also be making an introduction about myself on YouTube and how I got interested in music. This should help why I‚Äôm so poorly creative when it comes to music. Oh well. 

The song was a remake off of DJ Tiesto song. (He does not use auxy, this was years ago.) I‚Äôve remade (on auxy) it and put a few kinks into the song. I will put the original song down also. 

YouTube: [DJ Tiesto-Welcome to Ibiza](https://youtu.be/-JOlwVia1As)

SoundCloud: [Welcome To Ibiza-Tropical Remake](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/welcome-to-ibiza-tropical)

Hope you guys have a great day! üëçüèª

I was going to do this post earlier but the auxy website closed and I didn‚Äôt get to post this on time. Please if you can, give me in information why this happened. Thank you.

Edit- Also @MR_ANDERSON how do you get your music to sound extremely good? It could help out for some new people on auxy to.</description>
