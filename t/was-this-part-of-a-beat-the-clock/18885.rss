    <title>Was this part of a beat the clock?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/was-this-part-of-a-beat-the-clock/18885</link>
    <description>I found this video on my SSD while looking for places to free up storage space, but I don&#39;t remember making it. Judging by the image used (the very first version of my logo) it&#39;s likely from sometime in early-mid 2017 or 2016. It sounds like something I could have come up with on my own back then, but I can&#39;t tell for sure. That said, it leads me to wonder if it could have been part of an early beat the clock.

            <p>Not only was it one of the early ones, it was the first. That has to be over three years old at this point, wow I feel old</p>

            <p>Yeah, that sounds like a remix of Decruz’s BTC <span class="hashtag">#1</span> winning entry, which was one of the early challenges.</p>
