    <title>Plains - LimeZ [Read desc.]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/plains-limez-read-desc/16766</link>
    <description>I know. I know I haven’t posted in a while... I just feel, left behind y’know?
Ever since I lost my subscription, I just haven’t been able to create music as good as something like ᵛᴱᴿᵀᴵᴳᴼ, but I’ve still been trying (well, somewhat) and I’ll still try, because even if I take a very long break, I would never, in many lifetimes use something other than Auxy and GarageBand (although rarely). Sorry for digressing, but here’s the track!

Stay...happy, because I won’t if you won’t.</description>
