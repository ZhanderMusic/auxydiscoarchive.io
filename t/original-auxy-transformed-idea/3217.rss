    <description>For those of you who still have the iPad app of original Auxy, this challenge is for you. Make a song or demo using original Auxy and then recreate it in new Auxy with more production elements. Youâ€™ll be surprised of what you come up with! 

Post the original idea and the new Auxy Idea please in this topic! 

This is just an idea â€” itâ€™s not an official challenge with an end date. ðŸ˜‰

  <blockquote>
    Make a song like original Auxy (I.e.) one bass, one drum kit, and two leads. Feel free to use any sound from the new Auxy, and use any amount of automations as you want. Iâ€™ll choose the winners by November 10th, 2017. So go create! 
Feel free to send an axp privately! I wonâ€™t share it unless (a) you win or (b) you want to share it.  I donâ€™t want anything getting plagarized.
