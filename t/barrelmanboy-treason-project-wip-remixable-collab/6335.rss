Here is my latest song, Treason. It’s not a full song yet, but it is getting there. It is also missing some key instruments and editing skills I do not yet possess. This is why I’m making this post. I am asking one of you, or all of you, to help me participate in editing this song to a much more full potential.</description>

            <p>Hey, Fokkses, I was wondering something. I understand how well you know your way around Auxy, how to remix and all. And I know my ways of coming up with a fine tune for a song. What I’m saying is, do you want to try and work together on future songs? I’ll come up with my best impression of a song, and you clean it up in any way you desire.</p>

            <p>I love it! I really like that vibe it gives, its like an element of happiness and hope. At least that’s what I feel when listening to it. I also like how it had both parts that I featured in my song make their appearance in your remix. It was like nothing was left out. Thanks a bunch!</p>

            <p>I like how you made the sounds sound unique, and I enjoy how you used the first part of the song as your main focus. However, from what I have experienced, I was really hoping you would have used the second part of the song as your main focus. I could almost hear the remix already, with that specific tune. If you would, it’d be nice if I got the second part of my song remixed. I hope it’s not too much, but I also hope you understand!</p>
