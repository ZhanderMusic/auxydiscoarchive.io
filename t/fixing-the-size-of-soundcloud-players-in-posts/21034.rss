Firstly, great to see that it‚Äôs possible to post Soundcloud players in posts again. Thanks üëç

QQ: Can anything be done to fix the layout/width issue?
They appear as tall, thin blocks, using a fraction of the available width, even on mobile.
They would be more useful and usable if they made better use of the available width.

            <p>I also found this article, but it‚Äôs not anything specific to Discourse <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003453587-Embedded-players" class="inline-onebox">Embedded players ‚Äì SoundCloud Help Center</a> - already tried the iframe embed here and it does not work, I end up with two links‚Ä¶ very strange. That‚Äôs about all the cycles I can spend on this right now lol.</p>

            <p>Aight.</p>
<p>In my totally non-professional, non-admin opinion, it seems like Discourse isn‚Äôt rendering properly from <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com">www.soundcloud.com</a>. If you put in a Bandcamp link, you get the mini player like always. In the example of Alch‚Äôs track the URL is actually <a href="https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl">https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl</a> which is something newer I guess, weird Google tie in. If I put a full URL to a track on SC it also doesn‚Äôt render (this may or may not have always been the behavior? I kind of remember always posting track art as an attachment here, and then posting SC link below it. Maybe that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶)</p>
