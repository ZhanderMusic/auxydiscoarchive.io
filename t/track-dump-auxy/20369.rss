            <p>I’d pull ‘Fine By Me’ (both versions) as, to my ears, they have all the right parts to be finished as a great track.</p>
<p>The mix and sound choices/design would benefit from more attention. That great lead melody in the latter half is being a little overwhelmed by the brightness of the synth chords, so maybe something to look at there.</p>
<p>Haven’t even checked out the others yet, but wanted to say that Fine By Me has a solid foundation that warrants more attention. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
