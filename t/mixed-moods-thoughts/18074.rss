            <p>Recent sounds. Haven’t seen shape or tone controls in many of 'em. Most of the older updated sounds have them because of Auxy 5 adding shape and tone support to all sounds… and then some of them lost that support with Auxy 6 because of the addition of distortion controls.</p>
<p>Layman’s terms, some sounds just had distortion controls and chorus controls added on, and that’s why even some of the old sounds don’t have tone or shape support.</p>
<p>Wish we got full ADSR support for all sounds, especially for people wanting to change those properties with automation. So far the only sound that “opens up” with automation support is… well, it used to be Climb and Floppy but that’s not possible anymore.</p>

            <p>I first thought that this is going to be the pack I really wanted… now I’m not so sure. This could have easily been an amazing analog funk/nu-disco/bedroom soul pack. But nah.</p>
<p>Mommy is an okay bass, at least. But what happened to shape and tone controls, guys?</p>

            <p>After using this for a few days it’s really decent. Just to create the sounds that I am looking for I really have to dig into the design of each sound and tweak it where I can. Which I guess promote creativity. So all in all, good pack. Could really use some more organic sounds… or a trap pack.</p>

            <p>Even though there are a few sounds I really like, I have to say I think it’s bad in context of what we’ve been getting the last few months. There are just too many packs with these samey sounds. Auxy’s sounds used to seem so consistently professional, and they just don’t anymore. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>The reason I chose Auxy was partially for its functionality and features, but also for it’s unique and top quality sounds. Many of the latest packs have seemed closer to other mobile music making apps, without the distinct quality that set Auxy’s sounds so far apart from them.</p>
<p>I want to clarify this is not an issue with all the packs, but it seems more often than not. There have been some gems such as Heavy Bass. But for the most part, I’m rarely using any of the latest packs except for layers.</p>

            <p>Well… Let me hold a poll. I’m gonna use both types, so be sure to vote on Both!</p>
<p><big><strong>Is this new sound pack, Mixed Moods good?</strong></big></p>

<p><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/mixed-moods-thoughts/18074/24">Click to view the poll.</a></p>
<p>That is weird. If you gave the Pie a vote and forgot to vote on the actual poll, than you should go back here and vote on the line poll.</p>
<p>The final results look like a 50/50 [Febuary 23]</p>

            <p>Part of this is that most of the most common sounds have already been implemented.</p>
<p>I think that it would be far more useful to us users if the developers worked on features that allow us to further customize existing sounds than to just add more and more similar sounds.</p>

            <p>And in my honest opinion, all the packs have been kind of like this recently. I’ve spent years defending Auxy, but the sounds have just felt really bland lately and I’m starting to look into other softwares to get more of the sounds I want. I’m hoping the packs either improve or we get the ability to create our own sounds. I love Auxy and really prefer it to all other software, but I haven’t been happy with the quality of packs lately. Just my opinion.</p>
