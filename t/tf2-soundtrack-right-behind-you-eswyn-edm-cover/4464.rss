    <title>TF2 Soundtrack - Right Behind You (Eswyn EDM Cover)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/tf2-soundtrack-right-behind-you-eswyn-edm-cover/4464</link>
    <description>So one thing I like to do for practice is listen to a song and transcribe the notes. I do this typically for EDM, say for the chord progression. I decided to try it out on some TF2 soundtracks, because I really like them. This one I started to get carried away with, and added a little twist to the end. I just felt like sharing it with you all. I hope you like it!
