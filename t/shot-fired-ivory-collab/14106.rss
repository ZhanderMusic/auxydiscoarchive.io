            <p>I do like the main feel of the song, and there were a few things that stood out to me while listening.</p>
<p>You had a ton of instruments playing at the same time and I felt that many weren’t mixed very well. A solution would be to simply take some out and/or lower their volumes and reverb.</p>
<p>Also, the drop did not come until much later in the song. This isn’t necessarily bad, but to do this right you need have a:<br>
low point of the song (with less instruments, a calmer feel),<br>
to transition smoothly into the high point (an epic buildup, epic drop)<br>
and then transition back into a low point to match the next drop.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s a very good song imo, I cannot wait till I hear the finished project.<br>
Keep up the good work my friend!</p>
