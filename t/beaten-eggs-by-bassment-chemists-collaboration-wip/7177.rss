    <title>Beaten Eggs - By Bassment Chemists [collaboration, WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/beaten-eggs-by-bassment-chemists-collaboration-wip/7177</link>
    <description>So this is a track that I think has potential in the sounds but it needs some refinement. This is the first post I&#39;ve ever made and just curious what sort of response I get from this.

Thanks for your listen and input, and if you want to colab on this track specifically or just do your own thing with it hit me up in this thread or post where you go with it. Much love y&#39;all üôè
