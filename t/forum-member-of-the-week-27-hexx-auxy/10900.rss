**&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #27: @anon86704580  &lt;/big&gt;** 
 
 &lt;big&gt;Hexx&lt;/big&gt; is from Louisiana, U.S.A.  He considers himself to be a &quot;Trap guy&quot; and likes using the word &quot;Boi&quot;.  He&#39;s been participating in the Auxy Forum Tournament. 

&gt;&quot;My trademark is being repetitive. Something most people try to avoid, which makes it easier for me. It gets in people’s heads easier and sticks there like a magnet&quot; &lt;small&gt; (Feb 2018) &lt;/small&gt;

Hexx does vocals, including singing and rapping.  And that includes releasing Diss Tracks (Parts 1,2 &amp; 3). Basically, he invites forum members to be be insulted and lays down a rap diss track. The third diss track was released recently and is [here](https://soundcloud.com/hexx-official/diss-track-pt-3).

Hexx regularly leaves feedback about other forum members tracks and has started rating tracks based on his own rating criteria, which include uniqueness, predictability, complexity, use of Instruments / Automation / Samples &amp; feeling. 


 Check out his tracks here:  :soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/hexx-official/tracks 

 **Week starting: 2 July, 2018.**

            <p>Hey Hexx! Congrats on FMOTW!</p>
<p>It’s sooo impressive that you made songs with high standards with very short period.<br>
Making songs in short time is not necessary, but it’s always nice to see new stuff.<br>
so keep it up!</p>
<p>I should listen your stuff more!</p>

            <p>Alright! First off, congrats on FMotW! I’ve listened to a handful of your tracks, and I have some feedback!</p>
<p>I love the melodies and chords of Truth Be Told. I feel like the sounds were well thought out with that one. For Ducker? I hardly know her I really love the drum kit you used. Very well thought out there. I like what you did with the drop but I honestly feel like the little arpeggio (Stress I think) could really sound cool if mixed with more sounds and some panning. I’ll be completely honest and say that Drop it Hard really isn’t my style, but I can really appreciate the amount of thought I feel like was put into it. Very rich and full sounding. I really love the track Zeus. Really cool buildup, definitely gave me the chills. I have a few ideas for a possible remix of Zeus, so I was wondering if you’d possibly be willing to share stems or a project for it? I seriously enjoyed listening to your stuff, and will continue to listen tomorrow. I left myself very little time to do this, but everything I found was awesome! Keep up the great work mate, and congrats again!</p>

            <p>You’ve done a bunch of remixes and collabs, but I stuck to the recent solo tracks, to check out your skills.</p>
<p><strong>Favs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feelings -  Love the intro.  Good track from end to end.  Solid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crippled 2.0 -  Interesting drums and nice deep bass which contrast nicely with the piano. Sick of WUBS, but apart from that, excellent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other tracks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dis track 3 -  Always fun to hear a rap about the forum members.    Mono-rap!   Will Dis track 4 do the other ear! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rofl.png?v=5" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop It Hard - I like this. Could work well with rapping on top too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duel of Hates - Remember to put “Re-mix” in the title, like you have on other tracks. I was thinking, really - you wrote a Star Wats theme? Because the re-mix tags you added don’t appear unless you drill down further</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zeus - Nice bold, epic sounds.  Suitable for the final boss-battle in a game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have a unique sound, which I’m not seeing other forum members doing.</li>
<li>Your cover artwork is often hard to read, difficult to interpret or doesn’t seem relevant to the track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being our FMOTW!</p>

            <p>almost forgot to leave feedback xd</p>
<p><strong><em>FEELINGS:</em></strong> good intro, piano is a bit loud tho, Drop is lit, didnt expect it at all when i first listened. The piano that goes on during the second part of the drop fits it well. Also nice little piano at the end <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
8.5/10</p>
<p><strong><em>Truth Be Told:</em></strong> epic piano right at the start, again maybe too loud. verr nice drum. Buildup is pretty ominous and cool. anddd drop is very interesting… The lead you chose was perfect, but the bass didnt fit at all. still good melody for the drop. Second drop is extra <em>nice</em> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Very good drums and lead<br>
8/10</p>
<p><strong><em>Ducker i hardly know her (xdd):</em></strong> intro is very lit, reminds me of mortal kombat. The bass is also very nice and aggressive right from the start. Drop is kinda generic, but still nice choice of instrument, coulve been a bit louder though. The second part of the drop is a lot better combined with that lead. Second drop has verr nice drums. I like the variation towards the end. overall pretty good <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
8.3/10</p>
<p><strong><em>u stole my fizzy levitating beverages:</em></strong> very nice instruments at start. Drop has some sicc bass, and the lead is <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"> . Also very nice drums. Second drop is trippy af with that pitch bending and kicks, excellent job there. Very unique trap song overall<br>
8.222/10</p>
<p><strong>diss track pt.3</strong> : my left ear thought this was incredible<br>
1.3bil/10</p>

            <p>Your songs are really cool, I especially like the drop in your song drop it hard<br>
But I think you should add more instruments and melodies to make it sound fuller and more interesting.</p>

            <p>Time for me to leave some feedback. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><em>Feelings</em>: Piano chords are good, that seems to be a theme with your music. Intro drums play on a unique rhythm too. I like how the sweeper blends with the chords.</p>
<p><em>Truth be Told</em>: Again, piano chords are amazing! I like the drums at the beginning, maybe the snare could be quieter. The pitch bend is well done and doesn’t seem too…bendy. The chords are still there. In the drop, the hi hats could come in a bit sooner, to keep the listener’s interest.</p>
<p>Congratulations on FMOTW!</p>

<p>I like the tribal feel of the drums at the beginning</p>

<p>I feel like there should be… more, like a bigger build up or an outro more than just a fade out, make it longer, y’know?</p>

            <p>Your track, “Lost The Crown” made me feel sad but at the same time hopeful, for some reason, lol. I love the chords, but the voice could have used some reverb, or something similar.</p>
<p>Versatility: 10/10<br>
Creativity: 9/10<br>
Predictability: 6/10<br>
Use of Instruments/Automation: 8/10<br>
Feeling: 9/10</p>
<p>Overall: 42/50 Great job</p>

<p>Feelings- Your song “Feelings” has great chords! I love the cool peacefulness of it. WOAH THAT DROP came out of nowhere! I love the bass! Very nice automations with the bass. You would be good at trapstep. I love the percussion in this. Very cool buildup. Amazing trap drop. I love this one</p>
<p>Broken Time- amazing intro and build up. DANG I love this drop!! (Teach me sensei). The chords are pretty cool. Oh dang! I love that second drop! I love the brass. Only thing is that the punch bass was too low pitched. Otherwise!, awesome job. Oh wow! I love that recovery.! Very nice samples picked for this. Probably my favorite. Good job to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cornea">@Cornea</a> as well</p>
