    <title>|~*~*~| - Dadmother</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dadmother/13030</link>
    <description>This is one of my favorite tracks I’ve ever done, along with the EP it is featured on, “Modern Classic”. This track was originally released as a single called “Wallbanger”, but then was later released as a set of symbols, “|~*~*~|”, along with the rest of the EP. This is a feelgood, neosoul disco tune that I had so much fun making, and I hope you all dig it! I’m always open to criticism, so let me hear it! All musical creation, editing, mixing, etc. was done in Auxy.

            <p>WOW man. This track is just the definition of greatness.</p>
<p>The amount of effort that went into this must be insane. The tiny details in the beat and how the beat develops, the beautiful synths (that bassline fits the track really well) and piano loops, the piano solo’s, the drum solo’s (I could go on all day).</p>
<p>It’s mindblowing <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/exploding_head.png?v=6" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji" alt=":exploding_head:"></p>
<p>Great job! Keep it up!</p>

            <p>This was definitely one of my more time-consuming tracks, and I sat on it for a while and kept tweaking it until it felt right. Thank you for the kind words, friend <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=6" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
