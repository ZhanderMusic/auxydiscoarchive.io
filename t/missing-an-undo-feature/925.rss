    <description>A lot of the time, I make tracks with no mistakes.
But when I accidentally delete a loop... there&#39;s a problem. In my opinion, we all learn from our mistakes, and we should always get a chance to fix them. So, maybe on the next update, there should be an undo action. Like shaking your device gives a menu where you have three options: Undo, Redo, and of course, Cancel (or literally just tap outside the box)</description>

            <p>I agree that’s a good precaution, but when people are skimming down on unneeded instruments, loops, etc., they usually just tap past it before realizing their mistake.</p>

            <p>Agreed. The app is so simple to use, that when you make a song on it, it sounds like you used a more professional music studio.</p>

            <p>Aye aye!  undo / redo would be a very nice feature , and shaking is the standard iPod gesture to trigger the undo dialog box, so yeah, it would be nice, provided it doesn’t create issues with RAM that could cause Auxy to rollback other features or crash more often.  More often? Wait a second I lost my mind there for a second.  Let m clarify that comment,  Auxy is the most stable app I’ve ever used, and I’m dead serious.  The developers are phenomenal.</p>
