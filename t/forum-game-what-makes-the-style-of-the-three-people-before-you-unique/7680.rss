    <title>[Forum Game] What makes the style of the three people before you unique?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-game-what-makes-the-style-of-the-three-people-before-you-unique/7680</link>
    <description>Its so hard to describe your own music. You may be able to describe what you are/were going for but understanding how others are perceiving your music can be really helpful.

If you know what other people like about your music you can better promote yourself. Write it in your bio, use it to describe your music to friends, family*, and any potential listeners. 

In the spirit of these other topics.
https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-makes-your-style-unique/7643
https://disco.auxy.co/t/who-would-you-want-to-learn-producing-skills-from-in-auxy

If you do both you can see if you are hitting what you are going for... or if you should lean into something that you didn&#39;t realize you were good at.

&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

Rules:
1) Listen to and describe the 3+ people** before you so that everyone that participates gets multiple perspectives and opinions.
2) Please **be nice** - this is _not_ a roast topic, and the intention is _not_ to slam anyone. Say what you like about their style, there is something positive in all of them.
3) You can jump in more than once.
4) You don&#39;t _necessarily_ have to do someone if you don&#39;t have anything new to add.

Think not just about genre, but techniques, composition, energy, feel, etc...
Feel free to give references to specific songs. Most people do many genres or a fusion of them.
&lt;CR&gt;
[spoiler] *(thinking about the auxian who&#39;s parents wanted him to do anything besides this)[/spoiler]
**(obviously the first three people won&#39;t be able to do three, but whoever it is can jump in again later if they like.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CR&gt;
[spoiler] To many words... I think I&#39;m rambling... oh jeez I&#39;m first. Not sure I&#39;m ready for this. :cold_sweat:[/spoiler]</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/lilspikes">@LilSpikes</a> Your music is… spikey ;3 lol I love how much work you put into your stuff<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TXA">@TXA</a> your stuff is electrifying. High energy trap and future bass, while not necessarily my cup of tea, is really well done.<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/zoruwhite">@Zoruwhite</a> Your stuff is a trap ;3 Sorry I just had to. It’s really nice and well done, and while I don’t traditionally like future bass and the sorts it’s pretty cool</p>

            <p>Nice thread!! Hope this one thrives.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cheddr">@Cheddr</a>…  sounds are rather sharp but track is always smooth, very unique and fresh percussion<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/indigoo">@Indigoo</a>…very good at using light sounds(like sounds from melodic percussion pack), repetitive melodies but never get tired of (which is so impressive) +パ!<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_mooo">@Mr_Mooo</a>… solid and clear structure (intro, build, drop, chorus), love how he uses piano sounds<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/zoruwhite">@Zoruwhite</a>…nailing using unstable melodies for main melodies. Rather dark and mysterious.</p>
