    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/nite-lite-recharged-house-dubstep-collab-wip/15106</link>
    <description>My subscription ran out and I’m in between banks rn so I can’t renew it. I only have the second drop left and since I want this song to be finished soon I’m opening it up to collab with whoever can make a sick drop that fits in with the rest of the song. I’ll obv post it as ft. (your name). Lmk if anyone is down I’d love to hear what y’all can create :smiley:
