    <title>Creating own cover art- software, methods?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/creating-own-cover-art-software-methods/11878</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I really like the cover art ppl are creating themselves, like @aUstin_Haga, @Produk , and @MR_ANDERSON , and I was wondering if you guys or anyone else would share what you use to create your own art as I am considering making my own too.(if you don&#39;t mind ppl knowing. If you want it secret, don&#39;t tell then!)

Thank you all!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s my process:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I visit <a href="http://unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a> and download a royalty-free photo to use. They’ve got some super high-quality pictures. (I hope to use pictures that I take one day, but not yet.)</li>
<li>After that, I go to Trigraphy (iOS) and blend it with some snazzy modern-art effects.</li>
<li>I finish it off with Over (also iOS) by adding a track name in one of their amazing fonts.</li>
<li>Occasionally, I will also add my logo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this was helpful!</p>

            <p>I’d recommend investing in a decent art program, as it has many uses outside of creating cover art. Here are a few recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Affinity Designer (~$48) Like a better version of photoshop. A bit of a learning curve but if you invest about 15 minutes into it you can easily get the hang of making professional album art among countless other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pixelmator (~$20) Not as full featured as Affinity Designer but you can do some nice things with it for less than half the price, including well designed album art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trigraphy (~$25 for a subscription) Essentially just adds filters to your photos. I wouldn’t recommend it as you can’t really go anywhere beyond photo editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canva (Free for most uses) I used to use this service but stopped because of the limitations. You may as well invest in real software if you’re willing to pay the fee to remove those limitations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend photoshop unless you plan on getting into digital design beyond cover art as it has a very high price tag and a somewhat steep learning curve to it. <a href="http://Paint.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.NET</a> is an okay choice as well but is windows exclusive.</p>
<p>(For what it’s worth, I do all my designing including cover art in Affinity Designer currently. I’d definitely recommend it.)</p>

            <p>Depends on what picture you’re trying to create. For most people, photoshop works for photo creation as well as photo editing.</p>
<p>If you’re going for something super crazy and high quality (and 3D) you can get something like C4D.</p>

            <p>Sweet, I use canva, but It really doesn’t help you mix colors and shapes around. Just a bunch of templates. Great for adding words and fonts, though</p>

            <p>I don’t know about them but I use a mix of canva and Enlight Photofox which does the trick for me… they’re both free apps</p>

            <p>Hey guys,<br>
I really like the cover art ppl are creating themselves, like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/austin_haga">@aUstin_Haga</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/produk">@Produk</a> , and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_anderson">@MR_ANDERSON</a> , and I was wondering if you guys or anyone else would share what you use to create your own art as I am considering making my own too.(if you don’t mind ppl knowing. If you want it secret, don’t tell then!)</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>
