    <title>It&#39;s been a while!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/its-been-a-while/18638</link>
    <description>Hey everybody, Mr. Anderson here. It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve made a post here, and even longer since I was actively involved on a regular basis. I love Auxy, but have been somewhat estranged from the community. That being said, I&#39;d like to become more involved in the future. 

There&#39;s so much rising talent here that I&#39;ve noticed that has really impressed me. I wish I could collaborate with everyone, but I often lack the time (and, frankly, the creativity) to complete so many projects. So I thought of a compromise. What if I just was available to give feedback on any project from any user at any time?

So, in an effort to get a little more involved here again, I would like to extend an open invitation to *all of you to get feedback from me personally on anything you&#39;re ever working on*. Given the current situation with the coronavirus, I do have more free time in my schedule than I normally would, and I would be glad to answer music questions or give feedback on anything. Shoot me a dm, and I&#39;d be glad to help!

Hope to hear from some of you soon!

Mr. A</description>

            <p>Yes, how much would it cost for a critique in which you call my music “hot garbage”? Asking for a friend.</p>

            <p>Nice to see you back on the forum. Feels weird being the first to reply here but it’s all necessary to get the ball rolling haha</p>
<p>To be completely honest I may show up here with a track of mine from time to time— I haven’t been feeling so confident in my recent projects; in fact, I have a released track right here! I’ve gone back to auxy bass for this track in particular while trying to incorporate my own elements in there.</p>

<p>You’re doing a great favor, Mr. A! Can’t wait to see what you pull off in the future!</p>
