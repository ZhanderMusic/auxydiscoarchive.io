            <p>Imported a 4 bar loop from elsewhere, played perfectly once I extended the loop length. And I made sure tempo was the same.  I did some math, at 120 bpm, 16 seconds is 8 bars.  So with this limit if 10 secs, you can surely fit any 4 bar loops you have into most reasonable tempos.</p>
<p>Oh and samples will play in their entirety so make sure you have nothing extra in there</p>
