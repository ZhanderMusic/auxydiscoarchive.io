            <p>Yeah I should have gone for that lol but for this track I wanted to keep it so simple &amp; repetitive that it’s memorable…maybe lol<br>
Anywho I’ll take that to consider for the next few tracks I have :3</p>

            <p>Super chill, its great. I understand that this type of style doesn’t typically have much variation but I reckon maybe changing up the melody or the chord progression every now and again could do wonders. You don’t want it to be too repetitive, however I do love how you varied the drums a lot throughout this. Other than that its a great track. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
