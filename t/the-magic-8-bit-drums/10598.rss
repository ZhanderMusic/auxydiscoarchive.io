    <description>Can anyone direct me to samples of 8-bit drums or maybe give me some techniques on how to make them? I’m looking for stuff to sound like this:

            <p>Probably because the setting could make the samples function in unpredictable ways, or applying distortion to a ten second sample was crashing everything, which is unlikely to be honest. My guess is that they didn’t want to worry about things like that not playing nice.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the beta testers could shine a light on this?</p>

            <p>Yup! If I remember correctly, Mold straight up had a bit crusher. The others had various distortion / compression etc. I get why kits don’t have differing controls now, but a set of FX across any kit setup would be cool…</p>

            <p>If you also still happen to have any of the old legacy kits, applying the distortion slider to them creates a retro-like sound on most of them. Dollar, Stance and Craft are three great instances of this. Unfortunately, they took away this feature in Auxy 5 for… reasons.</p>

            <p>I was mowing the lawn and thinking about it a little bit more. One other VERY important thing is the old school sound chips were monophonic per channel. So no chords. You get glide per channel, but only one note at a time.</p>

            <p>Oh also, worth checking out BeepBox. That runs in a browser, looks and sounds trackery. Not that only trackers can make this kind of music, hardly, but when you look at how it was historically done that’s the territory you’re getting into. There’re a few folks here more comfortable with trackers and more knowledge <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>So. There’s the easy way, and then the not easy way.</p>
<p>The easy way is to load up samples and apply a bit crusher. Auxy has no such animal, GarageBand and other apps do. GB actually has a bit crusher directly available on some of the drum kits. It would get you close.</p>
<p>Stuff like this though was/is primarily done on a tracker. When you think about the sound architecture of a Gameboy or Nintendo, you’re talking (without expansion ROM chips like Konami and junk used) max five channels, including noise.</p>
<p>Looking at Nintendo, you had two square Wave channels with PWM, a triangle and noise. Can’t recall if sine was there, actually I think not and then that means there’s actually four channels.</p>
<p>A triangle wave melody is usually the bass line / kick, depending on modulation. Squares are usually your leads and noise is snare / hats (depending on volume and modulation).</p>
<p>A good free way to play with this is Famitracker, Windows only. You could also check out Sunvox though it’s not the same under the hood. That’s at least cross platform.</p>
<p>That’s about all I can say on this. 8bit / chip time is one genre I could never wrap my head around.</p>
