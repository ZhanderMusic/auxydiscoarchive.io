            <p>I make music in Auxy mostly and it’s usually EDM, but I also have individual tracks that are actually very different genres.</p>
<p>Ableton is more difficult for me to use because it’s harder to generate chords on a non touch screen device, but also because there are so many fine-tuning features that each serve for a specific individual function which is why Auxy is easier in most cases. However, the newest update in Auxy did start to remind me more of the hundreds, and I mean hundreds of features on ableton, even though Auxy may have around 20-50 at most.</p>
<p>In the end, ableton does give you the advantage of a clean and well-built track, but it is much more time-consuming. Also, ableton allows better mastering. (Mastering is when you can easily balance instrument volumes comparatively and then raise all the volume in general. The program tells you when you are redlining, or when you are cutting out on most speakers, and so you can balance a track to be louder when the volume level of say a phone is lower.)</p>

            <p>Ableton is hard to use! And it takes foreeeeeeever to learn and master. That’s why I’m too lazy to use it most of the time. To make a basic intro in ableton takes the amount of time it takes to make a well balanced intro, buildup, and chorus on Auxy, at least for me, lol. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=9" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>

            <p>In addition to Auxy I also use Ableton Live 10. I use auxy more though, because it’s way simpler and is just a better experience in getting to know the fundamentals of making music and it’s way easier to use. And as for my style, I basically just make some loops, if it sounds good, I expand on it. I don’t really have a specific style I like to use, just whatever sounds good <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/5.png?v=9" title=":+1:t5:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t5:"></p>

            <p>I only use Auxy, and I find myself making beats in a variety of genres. That being said, I find myself making beats much more easily in synthwave, atmospheric, and lo-fi/slightly jazzy beats. Idk really, because they’re not even the genres of music that I grew up listening to, but I somehow have a tendency to go there. It’s cool nevertheless!</p>

            <p>i use ableton.</p>
<p>i have many styles, but i only release chill stuff. i’m big into lofi hip hop and it’s gotten me a lot of success outside of this community so i recommend trying it if you can’t figure out what genre to make.</p>
<p>most lofi hip hop is sampled, and seeing as ableton has great sample functionality, it’s really easy to make the stuff i want, even with the limitations of ableton intro.</p>

            <p>Reason, GarageBand, Auxy. Regardless of platform, post rock / alternative electronic / glitch etc seems to be what comes out. I listen to a lot of different stuff but you write what you write, I guess…</p>

            <p>It’s definitely not the conventional Auxy sound hahaha! I’ve manage to make it work, though.</p>

            <p>Ableton<br>
Auxy<br>
Garageband (tho not for new projects)</p>
<p>Auxy helps me with being creative with things like automation or variation in melodies.  Just in general it’s sped up and really helped me become a better producer.</p>
<p>Garageband is good to start things off with and helped me be more acclimated to using a full desktop DAW.  One benefit, like auxy, is that there is a lot preset sounds and all of them have a variety of knobs n stuff you can adjust to get new sounds or automate things, more so than you can with auxy.  Also it’s helpful to be able to record directly into whatever I’m working on.  (also the shortcuts for GB are a bit more natural for me, so i can run around it all I want)</p>
<p>Ableton is the most “professional” piece of software I have for music and is the one I’ve been using most as of recent.  I get a lot more creative control than either of the 2 above mentioned apps.  Ableton pretty much lets you start from the ground up and you can fine tune most anything you could ever want to.  Also it feels a lot more clean in terms of layout than Garageband, but that’s just imo, I can still navigate both with ease.</p>
<p>tl;dr All of these contribute to how I produce in some way.</p>
<p>But I think GB brought me to find what genres/styles I like to produce, Auxy refined my production skills, and Ableton has simply elevated all of it to a new level for me.</p>
