    <description>- Oboe
This can give an adventurous or a type of exploration feel to music.
Example music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knS1SbhmV94&amp;t=25s

- Pirate Violin
Would definitely be used for a popular music theme!
Example music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsemU6yb7hA

- Power Sound Thing
I have no idea what this would be called. It&#39;s a creative one for sure, would use something like the instrument used in the main melody of the example below. It would probably a bit different and less retro, but it&#39;s a very strong and powerful instrument that could add variation to some types of music.
