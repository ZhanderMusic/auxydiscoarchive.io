    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/genre-reggaeton-pop/16297</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!
In this thread we talk about Reggaton pop!
Popular songs like “Despacito” have a pop feel but most people would refer the the genre Reggaeton pop.
This genre has a lot of drums that sound like this: https://app.auxy.co/projects/jdIcneueKSeQHZb-7_ebfQ==.
Please only links and videos that have to do with this genre because you know Auxy Disco.
It can get crazy some times...</description>

            <p>Anytime I think of this genre, all I can think of is Daddy Yankee. I strongly suspect this video is NSFW, but, I strongly suspect these are all tropes of the genre. This song was a CLASSIC.</p>

<p>True story, before I worked where I work now, I used to work for an IT consultation company and we had a client out in Queens. I’d roll through Long Island City in my Chrysler New Yorker blasting La Calle, crazy times. It was a very very short lived phase <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but yeah, Gasolina was a major hit of 2004. Crazy that this song is 15 years old already…</p>
