    <title>Create A Song For a Short Film! (Winners Announced)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/create-a-song-for-a-short-film-winners-announced/14581</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m making a short film with a few people I know and it&#39;s all about music. We will be using Auxy a lot, so I thought it&#39;d be fun to make a contest out of it. The deadline will be March 21st for now (but I may extend it) Any genre is acceptable, but I&#39;m looking for something that&#39;s chill and upbeat at the same time. 

Thanks!</description>
