    <title>New release of a sample pack mean a new remix</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-release-of-a-sample-pack-mean-a-new-remix/16319</link>
    <description>I have been thinking how can the auxy team be more active in the community of challenges, so each time there is a new sample pack release a thread is created to remix it and the person who host/the thread will judge the songs and auxy maybe able to shout them out for a prize. Just a thought nothing more.</description>

            <p>Honestly, said group is so small at this point it’s unlikely to significantly affect participation.</p>

            <p>That’s a great idea, but there’s a group of people that only use the free instruments so it wouldn’t be as inclusive as BTC was.</p>
