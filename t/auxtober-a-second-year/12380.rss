    <title>Auxtober: A second year?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxtober-a-second-year/12380</link>
    <description>For you all (y&#39;all ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰) Auxicians who where here since the birth of the Auxy Party aka Disco (or at least a month or two after the party got started), you might&#39;ve remembered my idea of Auxtober (Auxy + October), where you&#39;d create a track, preferably **_Spoopy_** themed, make it within a day and post it the same day and we&#39;d all check out what you&#39;ve made! 

[Auxtober 2017](https://disco.auxy.co/t/introducing-auxtober/2871)

I was thinking this year we have a specific challenge each week, like a certain instrument, chord, or whatever, or to spice things up, make it a different challenge every _day_ . 

Unfortunately, my good trusty iPhone broke and I had to switch to a weak 32-bit iPad, using FL Studio Mobile to make songs (zero progress has been made ðŸ˜‚), but I have the ancient version of Auxy (Blue logo, white A) and this could mean a nostalgic bunch of possibilities for making Auxtober tracks (I miss using Hour, Silk and Automation :cry:). (Nothing wrong with the original pack and no automation, I can do it!)

But rest aside, what should we do this year to mark this unofficial open Auxy event?</description>

            <p>You beat me to making this thread xD</p>
<p>To be honest, Iâ€™m just doing this to really challenge myself and grow as a musician. I havenâ€™t had the time yet to get everything set up, but once I do, Iâ€™ll be posting regularly in here.</p>
