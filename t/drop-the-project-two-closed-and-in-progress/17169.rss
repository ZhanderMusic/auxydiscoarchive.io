    <title>Drop the project two? [closed and in progress]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/drop-the-project-two-closed-and-in-progress/17169</link>
    <description>i was thinking about something like this. dtp 1 was really good, but now that we have auxy 6, theres alot of untapped potential. this is the first megacollab im organizing, but ill try my best. if you want in just let me know. :)

unfortunately, you can no longer join. You can still join the discord though, for self promo and a nice community!


if your joining, join this discord.

            <p>Yeah but you guys probably shouldn’t name it drop the project 2 incase auxy wants to do an actual one. I’d name it something else and just call it a megacollab since that’s what it would be if it’s open circle.</p>
