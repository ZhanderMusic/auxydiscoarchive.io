    <description>I found this article extremely useful. 

https://www.ascap.com/news-events/articles/2017/07/giving-better-song-feedback



Excerpts:

&gt; SUMMARY
&gt; 
&gt; Understand the difference between songs that you like, and songs that are effective.
&gt; Monitor the moments in a song where you are more and less engaged.
&gt; Be specific. Always follow a statement about an effective/ineffective moment by identifying what made it that way.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Know the difference between what is “good” and what you “like.”

&gt; There is music that you like. And there is music that is good. The two are independent of each other, even though sometimes they overlap
&gt; 
&gt; There’s an important insight that comes out of this:
&gt; 
&gt; There is music that is good, even if you don’t like it.
&gt;
&gt; Just because you don’t like it, doesn’t mean it’s not good. People who do like it could spend several hours explaining to you what makes it good, and why they like it. If you can open your mind to it, you too can appreciate why it’s good. You may even like it more when you can identify more subtle aspects of the music that make the difference between good and bad songs within that genre.


----------

How about using some of these ideas when people ask for Honest Feedback(tm). (And yes, there are lots of place you can ask for that.)


----------

_Just remember that sometimes people just want to share the work they are proud of and have someone say they like it._

_Try using the below when people are looking for constructive feedback to make their music better._

Remember that people need to be in the right mindset to receive critical feedback that challenges something they poured their heat and soul into.



----------


Also you could ask yourself these questions to critically look at your own creations to make them better.




&gt; A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO QUESTIONS FOR GIVING GREAT FEEDBACK
&gt; 
&gt; CHORDS
&gt; 
&gt; Is chord choice being used effectively to create sufficient contrast between different section types?
&gt;   Consider variations to:
&gt;     chord choice within the key
&gt;     chord choice outside the key
&gt;     placement of the Tonic chord
&gt;     cadences
&gt;     harmonic rhythm
&gt;
&gt; Is the tonality (major or minor) creating prosody with the content of the song? Is an opposition of tonality and meaning creating parody? Is this appropriate?
&gt;
&gt; Is the chord progression too simple or complex to retain the attention and communicate an emotion to an audience?
&gt;
&gt; Could a non-diatonic chord be used to spotlight a key lyrical moment, or create dramatic contrast in a bridge?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; MELODY
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a single melody that you can sing from the song 5 minutes after hearing the song? If not, why not? What could be added/changed to make a key motif more memorable/engaging?
&gt;
&gt; Is there prosody between the melody and the lyric?
&gt;
&gt;Does the melody feel like it is enhancing the meaning of the lyric (or is it neutral, or even distracting?) If not, what can change to more closely support and advance the meaning?
&gt;
&gt; Is there enough contrast in the melody between different section types?</description>

            <p>I’ll just say- “this is bad” is even worse than saying “this is bad. I don’t think there is anyway you can improve it. Instead of focusing on this song try writing something else where you improve on <em>insert certain aspects</em>.” imo because the second one at least offers more feedback</p>

            <p>I’m literally just heading to bed but I’ll give it a listen tomorrow. I think I’ve heard one of the songs already but not 100% sure. Definitely wasn’t bad if it’s the song I think it is.</p>

            <p>I just thought I needed to say this. There’s a difference between giving someone constructive criticism and just being a d<em>ck. Here are some feedback I got today <img src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/2/21eaa0ab31272ad650a812ece60f485ca0e9d679.jpeg" alt="image" width="690" height="180"><br>
This is good feedback, it tells me what I should improve on and making sure I don’t get offended.<br>
<img src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/5/53b8379f0d32b1fe7bb3dc44b5cb0af124b7ddd7.jpeg" alt="image" width="192" height="120"><br>
This is being a d</em>ck . Don’t be a d*ck when you give feedback, this goes without saying. This doesn’t help at all it just makes you feel bad.</p>
<p>I just thought I’d put this out there</p>

            <p>That was really useful. I never know how this to approach giving people feedback because I suck at getting what I think out and I never think what I write down is good enough. I’m going read this again and try to use these when I’m giving feedback.</p>
