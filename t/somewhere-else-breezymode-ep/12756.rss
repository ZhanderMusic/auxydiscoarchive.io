    <title>&quot;Somewhere Else&quot; - Breezymode [EP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/somewhere-else-breezymode-ep/12756</link>
    <description>Hey everyone-

Super excited for you guys to hear this EP I&#39;ve been working on for the past few months. I shortened it to 3 songs because they all have similar sounds even though they couldn&#39;t be more different. Super excited to hear your reactions!
