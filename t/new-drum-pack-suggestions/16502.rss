    <title>New Drum Pack Suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-drum-pack-suggestions/16502</link>
    <description>Auxy releases new drum packs every so often as part of the subscription so I was curious as to what drum packs people would like to see. I would like to see a Latin Pop kit that could be used for Latin beats etc. and maybe another trap kit because I need more snares rather than the hybrid snares on transcendent trap. What do you think?</description>
