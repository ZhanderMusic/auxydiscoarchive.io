    <description>Hey guys!
I’m currently working on a song, and i’m done with my first drop, but for my 2nd verse leading up to the 2nd drop, I don’t know what I could add or change to make this verse different from the first one. Any tips or help for this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

            <p>In my latest song, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dhomusic/space-caves">Space Caves</a>, I did something kind of interesting. In the first build I used an arp, and in the second I used a melodic solo. I don’t know if that’s the kind of tip you’re looking for but you should try it.</p>

            <p>The term ‘bridge’ is used to mean various things.</p>
<p>It can sometimes refer to the ‘pre-chorus’, which is a change in tone between verse and chorus that’s used to create momentum towards the chorus.</p>
<p>More commonly, it refers to a mood shift, often used after the second chorus, in place of a third verse and pre-chorus.<br>
It often involves a significant drop in energy, a bit of breathing space, and is (commonly) immediately followed by the third chorus, which is typically the peak energy within a common song structure.</p>
<p>It’s rare to have a bridge followed by the wind-down/outro, as it’s often used to set up some contrast ahead of a big third chorus.</p>

            <p>assuming you only have 2 drops, I think the term is a Bridge, but idk for sure.  Usually for vocal songs it has a structure like<br>
intro<br>
buildup<br>
chorus/drop<br>
breakdown<br>
buildup<br>
(smol)chorus/drop<br>
bridge<br>
chorus/drop<br>
breakdown/outro</p>
<p><strong><em>insert Big shrug</em></strong></p>

            <p>a r p e g g i o s<br>
for transitions, imo<br>
try using the same melody, but layer the sound with something new and maybe add a harmony, maybe a bridge before the chorus could be good. Do something different with the build.</p>

            <p>At that point, I usually intensify the drums and introduce either an arpeggio or a harsher synth to make the rise to the second drop even bigger.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Will it be a vocal track?<br>
(You say ‘verse’ and ‘song’ which suggests yes, but say ‘drop’, rather than ‘chorus’, which suggests possibly not.)</p>
<p>If it is a vocal track, then don’t forget you’ll also have vocal layers available to change things up between sections.</p>
<p>Will it have a full lyric or just a simple, repeating refrain?</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to make a complete instrumental track and simply stack vocals on top*. Best to leave space for the vocals, including vocal effects and layering.</p>
<p>(* Although that approach is quite common for ‘dance music’ tracks which have a simple, repeating vocal refrain, compared to full songs.)</p>
<p>If it is a vocal track, try to track down instrumental versions of good reference songs.<br>
It’ll give you a good set of references of how it’s usually handled within a vocal track.</p>
<p>(I recently checked out instrumental versions of the last two Purity Ring albums. Much less going on than you might expect.)</p>

            <p>1/2 Time Drums is a S1mple one to get some variation<br>
U could also<br>
Switch up melody (do a flip. Move melody up or down an octave)<br>
Keep melody, use new layers<br>
Add chords (if they aren’t there already)<br>
Add arp</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There’s a lot you can do and of course you can mix and match all these things to taste:</p>
<p>Keep some of thefoundational elements of the first verse (chords, bass, drums, whatever) and then do new melodies and/or everything else</p>
<p>Keep all the same stuff, but with different sounds</p>
<p>Keep everything but change the drums up</p>
<p>Make it a stripped down version of the first verse, perhaps something in the background of the first verse is now the focus</p>
<p>Have the same ideas going, but with different rhythms. For example verse one melody is primarily an 8th note feel. So verse two could be that same melody but with a 16th note feel, or whatever.</p>
<p>Or you could always just write a completely new verse. Something  that keeps the energy moving forward, but different.  You can still have your chorus/drop come in when expected to keep a sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>My favorites are the last two, but I do a little bit of all these things</p>

I’m currently working on a song, and i’m done with my first drop, but for my 2nd verse leading up to the 2nd drop, I don’t know what I could add or change to make this verse different from the first one. Any tips or help for this would be greatly appreciated.<br>
