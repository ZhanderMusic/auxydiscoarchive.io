    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/classic-auxy-remixed-with-breakbeat-drums-azureonyx/15467</link>
    <description>The breakbeat sample provided by @iammane has been included in Auxy&#39;s original classic demo track. I decided to include it with how I want my newer tracks to sound like.

    So, I spent a longer amount of time than I intended to cutting up some classic breaks and importing into Auxy. I thought it a shame not to share. 
These samples are not cleared. Then again, the genres of hip hop and drum and bass are UNDERPINNED by questionable sampling, so, take that as you will. I’ve set this up with drum and bass oriented examples, but you could easily dial back the tempo and use them for just about anything I guess (especially funky drummer).
