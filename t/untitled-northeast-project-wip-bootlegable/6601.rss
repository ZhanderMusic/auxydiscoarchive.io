    <title>Untitled - NorthEast [Project, WIP, BOOTLEGable]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/untitled-northeast-project-wip-bootlegable/6601</link>
    <description>So I’m feeling slightly confident about this one, however it is still not finished. I’m wanting it to be Bootlegged instead of remixed.

For those of you who are confused about bootlegs (which hopefully your not), in my description, it’s changing one instrument and/or adding others without changing the pattern of the song. 

I would like it finished, but would also love to have it sound different. It just doesn’t feel...right...to me. I’m not entirely comfortable with releasing it on SoundCloud - WHICH I DO PLAN TO DO - but I am comfortable with showing it to you all and seeing what you can come up with.

NOTE: This is not a challenge. I will use whatever is posted, no matter how many there are.

            <p>Now I know I didn’t say this before, and I’m sorry for not, but one of the constraints of this was to keep it sounding “orchestral” more than “electronic”.<br>
I still like it, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/anon73773654">@anon73773654</a>, and I’ll still have it used like the rest. I won’t count that criteria since I forgot it and this was already made. I’ll just need to remember to add ALL of my criteria in next time.</p>
