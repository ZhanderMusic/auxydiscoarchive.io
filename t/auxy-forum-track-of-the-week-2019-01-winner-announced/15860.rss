&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

This is the first week of Auxy Forum Track of the Week. Who will get the first win?

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual.  

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw.  I will the the only judge initially, while we get the weekly contest started. My intention is to handover to someone more musically talented once the contest is established. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a seperate winner&#39;s thread.

            <p><big> <strong>‚ì¶ho is the first winner?</strong> </big></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who entered. It was great to see a range of genre‚Äôs being submitted, ranging from super-chill through to pretty hard. And it was a pleasure to listen to them all.</p>
<p>The judging was difficult, as a few of the tracks were real contenders and showed innovation and skill. It was a close battle.</p>
<p>However, while comparing the tracks, it became apparent that one submission was being used as the benchmark to compare against. It was hard-hitting from start-to-end but in a controlled way.</p>
<p>Congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/littlespikes">@LittleSpikes</a> for winning Track of the Week, with his track: - <a href="https://soundcloud.com/littlespikes/phat-rat" rel="nofollow noopener">Phat Rat</a>.</p>
<p>The winner receives a   <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:"> icon next to their forum name.</p>
<p>And their name is recorded as a <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961">Track of the Week Winner</a>.</p>
<p>The thread for next weeks competition will be posted soon.</p>

            <p>Yeah, might be best to enter your other track.</p>

            <p>Big problem there, it‚Äôs the main melody. I used the one arp from the sound of vivrant and added a few note to make my lead <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat.png?v=9" title=":sweat:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat:"><br>
If it is an issue I have a different track I can post.</p>
