    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/randodudem-a-damn-good-time-jazzy-downtempo/19385</link>
    <description>Attempted to create something more acoustic than electronic; down to the choice of drums, horns, bass, etc. Very experimental (within the Auxy community, at least) but I had a blast while making this. Let me know if it works!

            <p>Cool. Yeah, the Auxy sounds can be a little hit n miss.<br>
The brass can be really effective and convincing, when used the way you have.<br>
They work well for those rich, warm chords.</p>
<p>(Side-note: Fantastic chords, by the way. Rich and lush extensions. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
It’s cool to hear Auxy being used for more rich, extended chord compositions. With certain sounds, it can be really effective and compelling.)</p>
<p>Cool to hear that you’re interested in developing it further.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’d suggest perhaps trying out some other basses, maybe even avoid the acoustic/electric bass guitar sound pack. It’s a tricky one to emulate well, and I don’t think the pack is particularly successful at achieving a convincing sound.<br>
As it’s such a core part of your track, the cheapness really cuts.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s more that can be done while still in Auxy. Maybe a layered option; a sub with texture to flesh out the low-end (currently missing in your bass) and a little grit, then <em>maybe</em> layering on the slightest top-end of an electric bass for character?</p>
<p>(You might still need to subtly automate the LPF and volume of the electric bass, just to give some variance. Part of the main problem/giveaway of the current bass choice is the lack of variance in the slap/twang, etc…)</p>
<p>For a track like yours, it pays to have a clear idea of what bass you’re aiming to emulate.<br>
For instance, the one you’ve used is quite slappy, which might not be the right sound for your track.<br>
Perhaps listen again to some Zero 7 and others from the Downtempo genre to hear what choices they’ve made on their basses.</p>
<p>Do you also use a desktop DAW?<br>
There are some really good, affordable electric bass VSTs around, and loads of great free/trial synth basses available.</p>
<p>Sax is more challenging. The good VSTs are expensive, and even then you need to really know what you’re doing to get something really convincing out of them.</p>
<p>(I’ve also got some sax sections in recent pieces that I need to step up on too. Some uses work better than others, with some parts still sounding very midi-fied. So, I’m looking at the options.)</p>

            <p>Wow, coincidentally enough, Zero 7 was actually my main inspiration for this piece (particularly, “Your Place” from “The Garden”). So hearing that this gives off Zero 7 vibes makes me jump for joy!</p>
<p>Indeed, I do wish some of the instruments sounded less artificial. I fiddled around with the pitch automation for the sax solo just to make it sound more realistic. But commissioning live parts on Fiverr sounds like a great idea!</p>
<p>Thanks for the thorough feedback!</p>

            <p>Aesthetically, getting strong Zero 7 vibes. Early 00’s, jazzy, chilled Downtempo.* (so, not particularly experimental, given that the Downtempo genre is a thing.)</p>
<p>Cool take. Particularly like the quick movement around chords around 3:04. Some really sophisticated chord choices.</p>
<p>I definitely feel this deserves to be taken further, and rebuilt using better quality sounds - or even commission some live parts on Fiverr, especially the bass. It’s a good piece somewhat undermined by the quality of the sounds and sheer midi-ness of some parts. (Not sure Auxy can get this piece where it wants to go. You could try micro-shifting the vintage keys in free-mode to humanise it, possibly starting with the double-time section. But, there are probably less RSS-inducing ways to do it if you bump the midi and reference stems over to a desktop DAW.)</p>
<p>A really good piece with a great vibe. Really good work!</p>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeez, is it really almost 20 years since Zero 7’s ‘Simple Things’ album?<br>
Btw, if you haven’t checked out Zero 7, do. I think you’ll get a kick out of them, if this is where your musical ear is at.</li>
