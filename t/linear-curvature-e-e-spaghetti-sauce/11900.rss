    <description>https://soundcloud.com/spaghetti_sauce/linear-curvature

From me and @SpaghettiSauce on his SC... 
&gt;Go check out @[eslashe](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe)! Huge thanks to him for making this track possible.
&gt;
&gt;The idea was mine, but the completion and the great execution was all from @[eslashe](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe).
&gt;
&gt;Hope you guys enjoy.

            <p>Thanks! Glad you at least liked it xD really happy to present this song, as the foundation laid out by my boi spaghetti was so good I just couldn’t ignore it. When he mentioned he couldn’t compose anymore because of the lack of subscription, I took to work turning his idea into what it is now, and we’re both very happy to present the result.</p>

            <p>Awesome, really like this. It’s put together well, flows nice. Choice selection of sounds. I know this might sound insane but in my head I hear vocals over this and it’s REALLY ace.</p>
