            <p>Hey! I edited the “We Are Warriors” track. I love the melody and the way it was put together!</p>
<p>It did need some editing and more tone variation. I made little few changes and added labels of what’s mine and what I didn’t change. Should say something like “WJ EDIT” or “Winter J. Edit”. I also added labels for the scene for what parts I left alone too. Hopefully this makes it sound better.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/rMY-O0GOUvtEBqiiOynMCA==" rel="nofollow noopener">We Are Warriors Edit</a></p>
<p>I’m also listening to the other tracks and they are also really awesome.</p>
<p>Edit note: I also forgot to mention that in my opinion the piano sounds a little to loud or overpowering the some of the sounds. So far everything else sounds great! Turning down the Lowpass should make the piano sound more “lively”.</p>
