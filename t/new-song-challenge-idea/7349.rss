    <title>New Song Challenge Idea</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-song-challenge-idea/7349</link>
    <description>I had this idea the other day. I want to make songs, but based around how I feel an artist sounds like. Kind og like my song &quot;Deep&quot; meant to sound like IVO. So send me your artists, (preferably auxy artists, even if its you) and I will post a song on how I think your music sounds</description>

            <p>This guy is not Auxy related but he hasn’t blown up despite having a trademark sound. Look up Chad Cooper and listen to his 3 songs: Guilty, Because You Can (Jolene), and Happy Song. He’s really good and I think it could be cool replicating his style of uplifting house/EDM! Totally your call it’s just a suggestion</p>
