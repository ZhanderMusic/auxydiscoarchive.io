            <p>I don’t think the app has to do with anyone being signed.<br>
I think that’s the artist’s responsibility.</p>
<p>If this app isn’t enough, then as an artist, we’ve got to explore into more software, and hardware.</p>

            <p>I’ve signed to release a single a while ago on a small label called No Status Records, and I’m in the process of getting ready to release an EP with them again in August. It’s very small, yes, but for where I’m at now, the promotion and revenue was acceptable at the time. I talk with the owner personally and he has great connections and deals that keep me interested for now. When I feel my music is ready for the big leagues, then I’ll feel more confident submitting to more notable labels.</p>

            <p>I almost did get something signed to a nice lil label in Europe, but it was kinda fishy because they didn’t speak English very well.</p>

            <p>Hopefully as the app develops, and the musicians develop and the music develops we can start seeing Auxy artists getting signed.</p>
