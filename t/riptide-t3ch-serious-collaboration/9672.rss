    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/riptide-t3ch-serious-collaboration/9672</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve got yet another project that I need some help with. The genre is Orchestral, Trance, and its got a bit of a House vibe to it. This project is for my Senior Graduation and it is May 26. PM me if you are up to the challenge. If you are curious to what my sound is, https://soundcloud.com/echnoolf/storm-2 

Thanks,
T3CH</description>
