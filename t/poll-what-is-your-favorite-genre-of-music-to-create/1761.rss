            <p>Yeah this isn’t really a problem unique to electronic music.</p>
<p>Metal (just for example) has a million pet / niche genres too. Everything does. I’d suspect the same kinds of conversations are happening on those forums too <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/metal/4.png?v=5" title=":metal:t4:" class="emoji" alt=":metal:t4:"></p>

            <p>To be clear, I share your definition of EDM - i.e. the umbrella genre under which Big Room, Progressive House, etc… all sit.</p>
<p>Just pointing out that, in common parlance, many use it to specifically refer to artists like deadmau5, Aoki, etc… and that there’s enough of them that it’s probably not going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>The distinction is most often made by those involved in music making, rather than general listeners.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>it can be both but technically it’s a category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I’d like to see your source for it ‘technically’ being a category.)</p>
<p>I’d be inclined to call it a genre, one with many sub-genres.</p>
<p>In so far as listeners understand the term ‘genre’, I don’t think they’d distinguish between ‘genre’ and ‘category’. I’m not sure the term ‘category’ is useful, when the concept of genres and sub-genres exists.</p>
<p>e.g. from EDMSauce…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, electronic music, or dance music) is a genre of music largely produced for music festivals, clubs and raves. EDM is generally used by DJs as they transition from one dance music track to another. Within electronic dance music is a plethora of sub-genres including House Music, Dubstep, Drum and Bass, Mashups, Moombahton, Electro, Glitch, Trap, Trance, Hardstyle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the other direction, I’d simply consider EDM as a sub-genre of Electronic.</p>
<p>Still, the point remains that there are many out there who specifically have artists like Garrix and deadmau5 in mind when talking about “EDM”.</p>
<p>They may be less ‘educated’ on the details, but by sheer numbers, they tend to win the language wars.</p>
<p>‘Progressive House’ and ‘Dubstep’ being two other examples of how the ‘correct’/original definition was dropped in favour of something else due to popular adoption.</p>

<p>Edm isn’t a genre. It’s a category</p>

</aside>
<p>Some might disagree with you on that.<br>
‘EDM’ has become quite commonly used to refer specifically to styles like those of deadmau5, Garrix et al.</p>
