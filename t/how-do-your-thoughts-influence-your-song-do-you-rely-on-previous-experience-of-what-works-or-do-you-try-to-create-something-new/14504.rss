            <p>I usually attempt to start clean slated on each track. Make silence become something different and new to me, something that reminds me of nothing else. I don’t know if I’m ever successful from the perspective of others but I can only see my point of view.<br>
It’s pretty emotionless at first but as it builds it take a shape and I try to push a narrative, but I’m pretty dark minded, so most of my stuff is well, pretty dark. Although I see it as fun and light creations really. It’s just fiction in waves and can be what anyone wants to see it as.</p>

            <p>I try to base my tracks purely off of a sound/instrument within the track itself. That way each track has a different vibe and groove. However, i try to keep in mind that i should make it somewhat structurally similar to other tracks that i’ve made so it can still be recognised as my music. That being said, i am still guilty of reusing drums from another track to save time lol.</p>

            <p>I feel you. What I reccommend is to take a loop from one of the demo tracks, change the pitch, and go with the vibe, create your own song. Edit the loop.</p>

            <p>I use certain elements from different songs of mine and try to transform them into something else. But also I do like to start something from scratch. There’s a problem with this though, starting from scratch for me is really difficult lol sometimes I get to used to the music I make that it’s tedious for me to start something new. Wonder why this made me take a break from auxy <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=6" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, I agree. Sometime I’ll listen to a song like four times. Each time I focus on one thing and tune everything out, like I’ll listen to just the drums, or just the bass line.</p>

            <p>I usually listen to songs and think, that sounds cool! I’m going to try to remake that, but add my own spin on it. As for emotion, I don’t base it off of how I feel, I base it off of how I want my listeners to feel, which is why most of my songs are up beat.</p>
