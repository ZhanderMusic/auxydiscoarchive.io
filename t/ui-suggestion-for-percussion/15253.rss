    <title>UI suggestion for percussion</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/ui-suggestion-for-percussion/15253</link>
    <description>So there I was,  trying to program a snare buildup in the last bar of an 8 bar scene.  I found a snare I believed would be suitable and programmed it in.  Bummer, didn’t quite blow me away like I I thought, better choose another one.  And this is the point the real nightmare began.  I realized to my absolute horror that I could not access the percussion sound packs from my current location, bar 8. Because for some reason they can only be accessed in bar 1.  This turned into a harrowing journey back and forth multiple times,  me just trying to hit those little bar 1 and bar 8 dots as fast as possible to save time, ANY amount of time.  Occasionally I missed the dots and would begin wildly scrolling, digging myself deeper.      I eventually found a snare that worked.  But I couldn’t help but wonder, out loud, to the universe:  “why cant the perc selector be a persistent header at the top of EVERY bar in the drum instrument”?  The melodic sounds can be browsed and tweaked from every bar.  What gives?</description>

            <p>I sincerely hope not.  We have a beautiful header that exists already, it just needs to be ever present.  That looks cluttered</p>

<p>He probably means something like this. Screen shot from Caustic.  The labels are shown on every bar.</p>

<p>Lenberg advised us that: “It would be a lot of work to get the slots to stay on top when scrolling, although perhaps we could add some labels to the drum grid as well.”</p>

<p>If you’re going to do something, it’s definitely worth doing it right. I doubt switching the entire way samples are loaded (moving off of iCloud to local) wasn’t exactly a walk in the park either, so if they did that, I have confidence they’d be able to make a way to modify the sample settings anywhere in the roll. A scrolling header would of course make more sense, but something here would be better than the nothing it currently is.</p>
<p>What exactly do you think he meant by labels?</p>

            <p>This suggestion was made during beta testing ie: having a sticky top bar that remains visible.</p>
<p>Lenberg advised us that: “It would be a lot of work to get the slots to stay on top when scrolling, although perhaps we could add some labels to the drum grid as well.”</p>

            <p>This would be <strong>an amazing</strong> QOL change. Having the header and the bottom section stay consistent as you scroll through the piano roll… Now that someone brings it up, we all say ‘why wasn’t that thought of sooner?’</p>
