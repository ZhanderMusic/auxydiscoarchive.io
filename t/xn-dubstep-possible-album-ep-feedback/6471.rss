    <title>___ - XN [Dubstep] [Possible album/EP] [feedback]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/xn-dubstep-possible-album-ep-feedback/6471</link>
    <description>Well 2 things. 
First, i have a new track ive been working on. Much 2012 dubstep lol.  Feedback is always appreciated
https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/ugly-shrimp-wip-straight-outta/s-k8tU1

Second, i&#39;m thinking about putting together an album/EP with a couple of other alike tracks (including the one above) i&#39;ve been working on or have backlogged and never finished (which i obviously would for the EP).  I would also combine some tracks from Auxy as well as some i&#39;ve been working on in Garageband. When it will be released is anyone&#39;s guess lol.

Auxy track (Obsidia inspired...kinda):
https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/stupid-gecko-obsidia/s-cRxza

Garageband tracks:
(only 1/2 done. still need a 2nd drop)
https://soundcloud.com/xn-extras/screamland-wip/s-Raebl

(still need to work on drop. it&#39;s a bit repetitive)
https://soundcloud.com/m_x_c_n/munstas-wip-or-something-1/s-p07MH

Again, feedback is always appreciated</description>

            <p>Ugly Shrimp had some great ideas. The triplet time drumming peppered in there is something I should be doing more often but don’t. I really like this I think it just needs to have some other sounds or automation in there. I didn’t notice anything bad about bee but sometimes I’m so bad at identifying the drop so maybe I just missed it lol.</p>
<p>Nice to hear dubstep coming out of GarageBand, they’ve added quite a bit in recent updates that made it more possible along with other genres. It’s a good tool overall.</p>
<p>I think overall these ideas are really good just need more polish. I do think they’d all sit very nicely in an EP together from what I’m hearing. Looking forward to more <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Lol. That moment when u like the first drop better than the second.</p>
<p>But yeah I can see what u mean. It is lacking a bit of punch to it. Maybe I’ll fiddle around with some different instruments and see what I can get</p>

            <p>The first part of the drop in ugly shrimp is just… bee does not work with it. It ends of just sounding weird and not really like a drop. 2nd part is pretty good though.</p>
