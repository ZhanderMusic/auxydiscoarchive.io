    <title>[Unicorn Challenge :unicorn:] Insurgency LP Remix Contest - Winners Announced</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/unicorn-challenge-insurgency-lp-remix-contest-winners-announced/13715</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!

A few months ago, I hosted a remix contest for my song Wind. I had a lot of fun hosting it, and a bunch of people entered. ![Screenshot%20(1)|690x375](upload://qIL9ACUv6PY9r72aOaAfIuzzqYm.png) It&#39;s been a while, and I thought it would be a good idea to host another remix contest, this time with a unicorn :unicorn: as a prize. 

As some of you may know, my debut album, Insurgency, came out about a month ago. For this remix contest, you can pick any track from the album to remix. There are 7 tracks (not including the prelude, interlude, and outro)

_____

You can expect the results by next Sunday at the latest!</p>
<p>Also, thanks to everyone who entered. I never expected that this many people would participate!</p>
