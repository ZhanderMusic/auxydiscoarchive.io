    <description>Guys my birthday is coming in 4 days so everyone plz remix this: https://app.auxy.co/projects/maiwTFcZ2bSgB7vQIPkIZQ==

And also whoever’s song wins gets a mention for my next collab. If we get more than 15 entry’s then I will have to pic five instead of one!! So please also type &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; with my mention and type some nice stuff you guys know about me. Good luck on your remixing and remember, make the best one. All the samples should be or not imported. And the tempo should be above 150. So when your done, type your project name with your name but at the end of it type Entry. Thanks and have a blessed time. P.S:this is a one week challenge. Plz make your hardest at it. After this is done and the winners are chosen, I will bring @iammane or @moderators to lock this up like the April Fools Challenge. Thanks.   May Allah Bless you all!!! [NOW CANCELLED]</description>
