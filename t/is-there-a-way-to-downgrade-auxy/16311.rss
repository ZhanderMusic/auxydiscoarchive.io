    <title>Is there a way to downgrade Auxy?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/is-there-a-way-to-downgrade-auxy/16311</link>
    <description>I’ve recently updated Auxy to Auxy 6 and I’m just far more comfortable with ver.5 
I guess I just need to get use to how the instruments work now, but I’m having difficulties trying to get the right tuning I use to get with the older instruments. I also noticed that automation for compression on drums is gone.</description>

            <p>Never knew why the change was made. I saw no problem with the previous one other than maybe labeling a scene now. The numbers might get in the way or something. Even just making the counter at the bottom a little taller could help with the problem.</p>

            <p>Agreed, scene count was nice. When this change first happened a lot of people were not pleased. It’s much easier to see what’s happening with a scene loop wise with the numbers.</p>

            <p>I meant I like how the loops on the scenes are placed.<br>

I actually like how the scene count is at the bottom right now, but it’s kinda boring to look at solid lines broken up by lines to show you how many bars the scene has.<p></p>

            <p>Sometimes I miss this. But if you think about it, the existing layout is pretty similar but on the bottom instead of side.</p>

            <p>I have one solution, but you need to be jail broken.</p>
<p>The tweak is called “App Admin” and it lets you download older versions of apps from the App Store. But, still, there is other easier solutions than doing this.</p>

            <p>I have no idea why apple would take that feature off. Luckily I still have 4 on my older phone, but it would be really nice to have 5 again for editing instruments on projects I haven’t finished yet.<br>
I was thinking maybe Auxy could have versions be different apps, but that would just asking for too much at that point. It would be nice to have that option, though.</p>

            <p>I know you used to be able to. If you backed up your phone to iTunes, your apps would sync and if you had an older version of an app you could restore that one.</p>
<p>But today, nothing that I know of other than like 3rd party apps/downloads for that stuff.</p>
<p>Wanted to do the same when v5 originally dropped (5 -&gt; 4), but the iTunes feature has been long gone before that so…</p>
