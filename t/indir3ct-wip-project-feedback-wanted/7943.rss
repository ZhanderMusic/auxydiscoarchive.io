    <description>Hey everyone! I’ve been working on a trap song recently. I’ve gotten in contact with some Lowly Palace admins and told them about Auxy. I would like to get this track done and submit it to them, and Trap nation.  But, I need some help with it. If anyone would like to take a listen, and add some feedback, it would help tremendously. 

Thanks!

P.s. this is totally a work in progress. It has a good way to go :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>Oh mama that’s schmexy. I would maybe add some sort of isolation before the drop of something to separate it a bit but once again that personal preference. It sounds super awesome though! I could tell you spent a lot of time on it!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback! I do have high hats there, but they are very quiet. I’ll make those louder. Also, I can knock 16 bars out of  the build up so its more balanced and fast paced.</p>

            <p>Dope! One thing I noticed is you don’t have any hi-hats. Not technically a rule that you have to have them, I just like hihats lol. Also, the buildup seems a little drawn out. I got bored after a while because it didn’t build fast enough. Just my opinion</p>

            <p>I have to agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/therealejoc">@therealejoc</a>. I trust that you will do this in the drop. From what I’ve heard, it’s pretty good.</p>

I worked more in the beginning, I will also change up the trap beat after the drop.</p>

            <p>Sounds petty fuego so far. Maybe advance the drums a bit. Like make them more complex as it progresses. But it’s all up to you and what style you’re going for</p>
