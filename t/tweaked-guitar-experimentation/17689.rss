Just some  guitar instruments. Some of them are made for rock, and some might be made for other kind of music that uses guitars. Feel free to use them as long as you give credit to me. Hope you enjoy! :)

As you can see, there are some more guitar sounds that I am trying to find.

[spoiler]The release on the two on the top are the year this was created and the year after this was created.[/spoiler]</description>
