            <p>Agree with MM post it here. If it’s not a 16bit wave file it will NOT import.</p>

            <p>I’ve sometimes had this error with importing wav files too. I wasn’t sure why either (they were under 20 seconds) I had to convert my samples to FLAC and it worked</p>

            <p>Put your wav online and post the link to it here, so someone else can test it.</p>

            <p>Hmmmmm…<br>
Beat to email the devs from straight inside the app! Tell them what’s going on, and if you could include a screen recording of what’s happening, I’m sure they’ll appreciate it!!</p>

            <p>Have you tried importing it again?<br>
This happens to me all the time. I try to import a short sample, and it won’t import, then I try again, and then it does work.</p>
