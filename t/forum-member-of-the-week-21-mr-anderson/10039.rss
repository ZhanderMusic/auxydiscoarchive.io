            <p>I like your music because melodies in your tracks are just gentle and chill.<br>
I noticed that you did some collaboration and remix which turned out so well. I’ve listened The Beacon so many times, and I also love the collab track with kayasho…<br>
Your latest remix sounds really cool as well, which definitely deserves more plays and likes…</p>
<p>Stay cool!</p>

            <p>Sorry I haven’t been able to listen to your tracks this week. They practically had me booked for work and everything. I’ve heard good things about your tracks though, and I’m certain they were well-earned. I’ll try to get some time in to listen hopefully soon (again with me not listening to anything ever it just sorta happens)</p>

            <p>I really agree with the total control part, everything is tuned perfectly, and the chords come in and out really nicely.</p>
<p>Your songs almost seam “fragile” or delicate. But with an intensity to them added by the drops.<br>
(What’s the word for that? Eloquent?)<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>Hey Mr A,</p>
<p>Your tracks always feature such uplifting positive &amp; chilled-out leads and progressions.  There’s a calmness to them. And total control.</p>
<p>‘<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mrandersonauxy/auxy-o-beat-the-clock-25-dire">Dire</a>’ (Beat the Clock <span class="hashtag">#25</span>) is a one of my favs; It’s a short but lovely piano solo.</p>
<p>And although it was last year, Catalyst remains one of the best Auxy tracks of all time. That intro and first build is still outstanding.</p>
<p>I suggest that you continue to smash it.</p>
<p>MM.</p>

            <p>I already have given feedback but I hadn’t heard your remix of treys song, launch.</p>
<p>Honestly those are the best wubs I have ever heard.<br>
I didn’t know wubs could sound like that. I love the thing that you did in beetween the wubs. Where alll the sounds sound like they are stretching.<br>
I am abosolutely blown away at every single song of yours.<br>
You sure have a future in producing.</p>

            <p>yusss, i get to listen to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_anderson">@MR_ANDERSON</a>  for 20 minutes!</p>
<p>your remix of trey’s “lift” is amazing. i no longer have to put lift on repeat and give him an uneven play to like ratio (sorry trey, i just can’t stop listening lol). but now i can listen to this as well! the wubs are amazing and the snare is perfect. only thing I’m unsure about is how far it deviated from the OG lol. If you released this as an original song, it would take me a while to figure out it was based off lift. Still good nonetheless.</p>
<p>your collab with Austin Haga is just perfect. best collab I’ve ever heard made in auxy. your two styles go together perfectly. nothing to suggest.</p>
<p>life is also a great one from the ep. i especially love the buildup and the drums in the chorus. i feel like the new auxy demo project was inspired by this song. 400th play!</p>
<p>i absolutely love the piano in the waters w/ eddxe. i think you could remove the pitch bend in the hihats though, and i think some lowpassed “distant talk in a coffee shop” sample would sound good. (maybe it’s because when i first heard the song, I was on a voice chat without knowing it and I thought the distant talking sounded good with the piano lol.)</p>
<p>pangea is so awesome! as always, the chord progression is perfect. i think the melody is a tad too repetitive but everything else makes up for it lol.</p>
<p>for some random reason I never really heard your music from before pangea. stupid choice of mine.</p>
<p>icebreaker is probably another one of your best. i really like the chillness in the beginning, and the percussion fills during the chorus were absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>and retrospect omg. i can’t stop listening. the melody in the intro is really nice and the pitch drop was also really fitting. everything that came after that was pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>and catalyst oh my god how do you do this. every little detail is perfected, and the snare is just so gooooooood. there is literally no negative feedback possible for this track.</p>
<p>listened to some of your other songs as well; nice<span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/forum-member-of-the-week-21-mr-anderson/10039/27">spoiler</a></span> job! i had so much fun listening to your work, and I’ll be sure to listen more later today!</p>
<p>and on a completely unrelated note… would you like to collab? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Congrats <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mr_anderson">@MR_ANDERSON</a>. You were on of the first auxy ppl i listened to. You have an amazing style of music, and your chords are <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=5" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"> I mean, fr the chords that u used in Reverence (my fav song of yours) are INCREDIBLE. I loved remixing the build up and drop!</p>
<p>Your music is spectacular, and I always love listening to it, and your stuff in the Auxy tourney was DOPE. I think your build ups are just so unique to you, and also so distinctive to your music. Also, your drums are so perfect for every song you make.</p>
<p>Your music is so advanced and well thought out, and you are one of the best auxy dudes in the game. I also love the way that the names of your songs and the cover art reflect the sound so well!</p>
<p>Keep up the amazing work!</p>

Ok so you have an awesome style, really distinctive. Normally I’m not a big fan of future bass, but you combine it with really energetic and euphoric leads and breaks, which make your tracks really enjoyable to listen to. You’re also way up there in terms of chord progressions, those are awesome, especially the piano ones. Catalyst is definitely my favorite song of yours; it’s one of my favorite Auxy songs ever. Pangaea and Icebreaker are really cool too!<br>
I also looked at your upload schedule, and damn, you make a lot of music, and it’s all quality. I really can’t think of anything you could improve on, so keep it up man!</p>

            <p>Haven’t had time to leave feedback so in case I don’t I’ll say this-<br>
Mr. A, I love your music! I still really want to remix Icebreaker. Don’t know if you got my message or not. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"> Your chords are some of the best in the community. Your BTCs are all some of the best (I really mean it). I also think you were extremely good in the tournament. It was a shame to see you go. My favorite track you did has always been your BTC <span class="hashtag">#19</span>. It’s really charming. I also just realized I forgot to like it so that’s done now.</p>
<p>Great work!</p>

            <p>Something that really stands out about your music is how you can make stuff all sorts of genres and still twist your own style into it. That’s hard to do. Both your melodies and chords are also really great. Your cover art also looks awesome and always reflects the song it’s for.</p>
<p>Not much else to say feedback-wise. Keep up the good work!</p>

            <p>Ok.</p>
<p>Your remix of Trey’s Launch has some nice chords in the beginning. I love the pitch rise at the very start and those awesome toms, the fill. Great stuff! the lowpassed snare and clap are very nice. The little happy melody thing background thingy that comes in in the build is really nice, and sounds so professional! You are one of my favourite auxy artists. The highpass in the build is very nice and kinda feels like you are taking off out of Earth’s atmosphere. The toms mixed the filly drums in the build to the drop are so cool! And then those WUBS!!! They are so amazing! How they aren’t just wubs, the chords are amazing, the bass sounds so cool. And in between wubs the thingy is just so amazing and I love it! The drums are especially good, the choice of samples is very good. The use of toms in the drop is also very good and keeps things fast and exciting. The melody that comes after the drop is very cool and goes well with the chords and happy thingies. I love that at 1:22 the melody is singled out because I really like it and wanted to hear it more. Can I hear some melodic percussion? Because I like it if it is. or if it isnt. The lowpassed snare in the build is nice but very quiet. The claps are nice, and so is the highpass again. The toms are cool because they are different from the other tom patterns and they sound quite unique. And those wubs are great again! I love how the wub pattern is different in that drop, so it varies more and makes it more exciting. Amazing stuff. The melody I liked that was singled out earlier is nice in the drop and just the right volume. The outro chords and drums are nice, I like the drums lowpassing out. I LOVE how the song ends, the very last chord sounds so good, and then reverb. Amazing! What a great song. You are definitely one of the BEST of the BEST auxy artists.</p>
<p>Your Auxy tornament 3 Round 3 is amazing! Wait, let me guess the instrument you were selected to use… marble!? I always thought that that was a useless instrument, but this sounds amazing! The chords are great, the melody goes perfectly. I love those 5 notes ‘do do do do do’ before the wubs. So cool! The lowpassed snare is cool. The wubs are great! The melodies and appregios and notes with the wubs make it so unique. The breaks, the drums, the everything, so cool and so marble! And I just noticed you used a outdoor birdsound sample as well! Great!</p>
<p>Your Auxy tornament 3 Round 2 is my favourite so far! The fill at the very start is so amazing! The samples you use are great. The strings at the start, the chords and melody with them are so cool! I love how you used pitch blending on them. The lowpassed snare is nice. The clap snare snare snare before the drop is nice and transitions it nicely. In my opinion the drop wub pattern could maybe be a bit different. imho I would’ve changed the fourth chord and the sixth chord, but it’s still nice! I love the little melodic ding after the first wub and some of the others. Very nice. The drums are especially good. Extremely nice fills; I can see why you progressed to round 3. The stress melody reminds me a lot of my entry, very similar. I like how you created… wait… let me search up Dj La Rocca on YouTube… uploads, yes… ah! <em>Tremelo</em>. I like how you used <em>tremolo</em> on the stress melody. It’s also a very good melody. The after drop strings are very good, and the drums are nice carrying on… and lowpassing out. The ending reminds me a lot of the ending of your remix of Trey’s launch, but that was still amazing so I loved it. My favourite so far!</p>
<p>Your Auxy tornament 3 Round 1 is so cool! The piano chords are really, cool and that happy thingy again! Awesome. The fast claps are nice and simple but cool. The fill before the drop is niceee. I can definitely hear the highpass. The strong chords in the background are cool. The drop is nice. One of the chords reminds me of a song but I’ve forgotten what it is. The really fast drum fill break is cool. The drop has nice piano in the second half, the fills are even mroe cool, so many of them! The outro is nice, with the highpass and that cool melody. That was the most jam packed awesome 53 seconds ever! Cool!</p>
<p>Okay, one more. Imma do 03 - life. The intro has such beautiful chords, and that melody in the background is PERFECT! The drum fill at 0:21 is cool. The bass is nice and heavy with nice pitch. There are so many elements already! The piano is really cool, everything is beautiful and works together. I like the claps lowpassing out, the lowpassing in for the build. The riser in the build is really cool. AND THE DROP!!! The chords are so strong and amazing! I love the electronic in between the chords, which blends. I like in the second half how you also included wubs. The drums are also EPIC! The drop transitions nicely out, and I like the trap beat. I love 1:47 and how the drums lowpass out, and the sweeper kinda reveals a beautiful melody and effects. The build is great, and the second drop is AMAZING!!! The I think highpassed strong chords inbetween strong chords is so cool, the drums are fast and exciting, the fills are great, the chords are beautiful! This is so amazing! The after drop melody is nice and feel. I think I can hear some strings. At 2:53 the feel of the song is a bit odd, with the combination of the new pattern of chords and melody, but it’s pretty nice. My favourite so far!</p>
<p>My favoruite was 03 - Life, my second favoruite was your Auxy tornament 3 round 2 entry. Your music is SO AMAZING!!! I was blown away by all your tracks. Just amazing! So great!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback! I definitely see where you’re coming from about the sweeper in Darkness of Night. I’m trying to spend more time mixing my tracks, so sweeper volume should be less of an issue going forward. So glad you enjoy Pangaea!</p>

            <p>And finally, the time has come to give feedback to the one and only MR ANDERSON!</p>
<p>I love your music. All of it really. I’ve had the Pangaea EP on repeat for weeks, ever since it was released.</p>
<p>My favorite is probably going to be either Darkness of the Night or Pangaea, both are super solid tracks and there isn’t much I’d change.</p>
<p>For Darkness of the Night, there are a few points where the sweeper is a bit loud (especially in the intro) and detracts a bit.</p>
<p>Pangaea is great but one thing that could be improved would be the introduction. The first time I listened to Pangaea, I didn’t particularly like the song before the drop. It felt kind of anti-climactic and boring. I no longer feel that way, but it was my first impression of the song <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>
