    <title>Jupiter - Hern [Electronic]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/jupiter-hern-electronic/22062</link>
    <description>New single from my upcoming LP, &quot;Empyreal.&quot; Going back to the space them I started this account with, but with a musical style more akin to my work with Vokon and the Intrepid EP. This will probably be the last single released from this project before I put the whole thing out there.

Hope you guys enjoy, constructive criticism is welcome as always.</description>
