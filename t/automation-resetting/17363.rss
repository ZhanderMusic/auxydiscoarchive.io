    <title>Automation Resetting</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I wanted to reach out to the community and possibly see if anyone else seems to be having the same issues that I am having... The reoccurring problem is with my sound profiles (sounds already on auxy), I will spend quite some time on a song and master the sound profiles; however, the problem that I am having is when I go to log back onto the app. It seems to be very inconsistent when it happens but every other time that I log onto the app, it resets the sound profiles and automation that I did previously and I have to go back and restructure the sounds accordingly. The only other thing that I can think of that would possibly fix this issue would be to automate the sounds by using the presets to alleviate this them being reset.</description>

            <p>I have this problem too, but it seems to happen randomly whenever I try to copy an instrument from a project to another.</p>
