    <title>Steps to remixing</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/steps-to-remixing/4368</link>
    <description>For those who don&#39;t know how.

Step 1: Delete every single scene and every single automation loop
Step 2: Delete every single drum kit
Step 2: Change the key
Step 3: Change the tempo
Step 4: Re-arrange their loops the way you like
Step 4.5: Add your own drums where needed
Step 5: Change their loops and add your own
Step 6: Finalize key and tempo

Something like that. Don&#39;t just make it slower and re-upload.</description>

            <p>Here’s how I remix:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change key, tempo, swing. Play around with those settings.</li>
<li>Decide if you want to transform it into a whole new genre. Perhaps you want to change it from House to Future Bass? The answer will help you for these steps.</li>
<li>Change the instruments. If you want to change the genre, use instruments that go well with that genre.</li>
<li>Automate. Make it sound different. Play around with its sound settings as well.</li>
<li>Add one or two of your own drum sets. I usually don’t tamper with the original for some reason.</li>
<li>Go through scene by scene. Add loops to places that need loops. For example, you can add a siren noise to the buildup.</li>
<li>If you want, add a new melody. Or, duplicate the main melody loop and play around with it, making a new melody that is similar to the original. You can se your alternate melody in some scenes.</li>
<li>Feel free to add sound effects! Little percussion things… you can even add a new bass if you like.</li>
<li>Personally, the next thing I do is usually wub the chords if they aren’t already. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">
</li>
<li>Finalize the things you changed in Step 1. Maybe the remix sounded differently than you thought it would, and it would sound better with a slower tempo. Maybe more swing? Your choice.</li>
<li>Then I take the cover art, add my logo in the corner, and maybe put a cool filter on top or something (like the watercolor splash used in my logo to show a I remixed it or something)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ta-Da! Eleven easy steps. Follow ‘em and you get a remix like this: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/newnames-wildfire-sanab-remix">https://soundcloud.com/sanabmusic/newnames-wildfire-sanab-remix</a> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Umm for your information, I actually render the original file, export it to my PC. Convert it to text file in notepad, connect my printer, and print it out. Then, I grab it and stick it in the shredder which is located in my dad’s office and shake the trashcan. Then I grab the Elmer’s Glue from my nephews backpack and squirt it all over the profile picture of the original artist I printed out after. Then I grab the trashcan and grab handfuls of the text file and sprinkle them over it, just enough so that it sticks. I go look for my duct tape and grab a sharpie and write “Zeph Remix” and then I tape like two or three of them over it so that it doesn’t fall apart when I stick in the scanner. I scan it, then export it to Microsoft Paint and draw sad faces all over it, render it, and export it to SoundCloud. But yeah, you can do it your way too.</p>

            <p>I don’t necessarily agree with deleting every single scene and automation loop, but otherwise I do agree with everything else.</p>
<p><del>…maybe drums as well because I’m absolute garbage with drums</del></p>
