            <p>Agree, most people listen to rips of YouTube streams FFS. But the people who do want quality, like DJs and headphones freaks, are the ones who are going to pay. I’ve made into the five figures so far on BC. Not as good as it used to be, because you’re getting more people coming to BC to rip streams, and the site does not offer protection against it, unfortunately. More artists need to bug them about this.</p>

            <p>I completely agree, I do this as a rule of thumb and it’s been semi successful for me.<br>
I haven’t even released to Spotify and I’ve already made like $9 on my music. Also, now that SoundCloud monetizes pro members, the platform will probably be better for small time artists like us, if you’re willing to go for pro.</p>

            <p>I’ll second all this. I’m not too concerned about income for doing this but I will say I’ve earned four times as much on just BandCamp than all other streaming platforms combined, in a shorter period of time. In all fairness I do no promotion, so it maybe could be different, but there’s no doubt that people are more willing to shell out a couple bucks on that platform.</p>

            <p>These are valid points. But I would say instead of Spotify or streaming on YouTube, a better way is to post certain tracks on SoundCloud and YouTube while including buy links to your Bandcamp page. This gets you the exposure of the larger platforms, while still directing people to a place where they will pay you for your music for extra/exclusive content and better sound quality. If you just make it available on Spotify, you will never convert any customers to that higher tier. And just IMO If you are posting your stuff on SoundCloud and as a video on YouTube and on all your social media, Spotify it’s not make or break in terms of extra exposure. And I can definitely say that while your audience on Bandcamp is smaller, It does become the people who are willing to pay you for your music, which is different from the other platforms.</p>

            <p>What I used to do when I was in school was write my Soundcloud on all the whiteboards in the classrooms I attended or stopped in. It was actually pretty damn effective in getting me some plays. If anything else, I would probably have to resort to telling my friends in person to check it out and tell their friends.</p>

            <p>imma jump in to this convo and say that yes the payouts for anyone is pretty abysmal.  But if you’re just purely looking for exposure and build an audience (I mean most of the people around here are pretty young and probably not having their Auxy music be their current career goals), then places like spotify or youtube are a way to get some of that.</p>
<p>While Bandcamp is awesome because it is artist focused, most people wouldn’t know what the site is if you just name dropped it.  I’d also bet that any random person is 10x more likely to already have youtube or spotify than Bandcamp to listen to music.</p>
<p>I just don’t see how Bandcamp gets one better promotion than Youtube or Spotify.  It’s good to have and link, but you still should have more common places to link for easier promotion.</p>

            <p>Payment to artists sucks from both Apple Music and Spotify.  They both suck but YouTube is the worst.  I know many artists who say that when Apple shifted from the iTunes download model to the streaming model, their monthly payments dropped by about 90%.</p>

            <p>Not only is their payment crap, it’s not transparent, so it’s very hard to figure out exactly how much you got paid for what. Not that many other streaming services are any better, with the exception of bandcamp.</p>
<p>Also, Spotify is all about its own brand, and the idea of AI-selected playlists over the pushing of individual artists/labels. They are hard at work developing AI-generated music that they can use to feed their own AI-driven playlists, so they can completely cut artists and the payment of royalties out of the picture. You support them in the short term at the expense of your career long-term, IMO.</p>

            <p>I probably would’ve chosen Apple Music over Spotify but I got it a few months before Apple Music was released and I don’t want to change over my library (I’ve saved over 2K songs.)</p>

            <p>Yeah it depends on the person, usually Apple Music users are Spotify haters and vice versa. I’ve converted quite a few people to Apple Music. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>I think that Spotify “not paying” their artists isn’t really a fact</p>
<p>and Apple Music being more convienient is also just an opinion</p>
<p>personally, I use spotify and I really like it, but if you prefer Apple Music, that’s fine</p>
