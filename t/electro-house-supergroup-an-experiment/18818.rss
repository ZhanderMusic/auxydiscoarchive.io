    <title>Electro/House Supergroup - An Experiment</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/electro-house-supergroup-an-experiment/18818</link>
    <description>We all know the giant megacollabs we love doing, and we all know that some folks work well together. With that in mind, I’ve got a strange idea I’ve wanted to try out for some time:

An Auxy Electro/House supergroup (think Swedish House Mafia but... not SHM) consisting of at least three people and at most five or six, with the main project being a potential album or a simple EP. This is different from the megacollabs as it is one large project with a small number of people compared to one track with a large number of people. 

I’m currently taking applications, and the applicants must meet the following credentials:

-Must have Auxy 6.
-Must have an Auxy Pro subscription. (My apologies to those who don’t, this rule is just for a wider variety of sounds!)
-Must know how Electro and House music works and how to produce it, as well as possible subgenres such as Melbourne Bounce, Progressive House and Progressive Electro (or Progresso!)
-Must be willing to fully cooperate in this project. Goes without saying, you can’t just agree and then not do anything for it. (Even a freakin’ arp pluck would work, at least you’d be *adding* something.)

I would also like a demonstration of what you have done with Electro or House music. This way, I can evaluate if you’d actually fit in the project.

Deadline for applicants is 4/20 (nice), that’s the 20th of April, so that is one week from today. I will set up a Discord server in the meantime and invite the chosen members on that day.

Good luck to everyone, I’m hoping this turns out successfully!</description>

            <p>Already mentioned this to you on AC, but I can volunteer my time and experience with helping to manage and provide ideas, as well as finalizing tracks outside of Auxy once they are complete.</p>
<p>As for my experience, I‘ve managed/co-managed two of the AC Collaborations, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/auxycollective/plains">Plains</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/auxycollective/rush">Rush</a>, as well as helped out with other collaborations in the past. I’ve also participated in the AC Megacollab <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/auxycollective/trick-or-treat">Trick or treating with the spook gang</a>, so I also have some experience with that.</p>
<p>I am both willing to provide this help as well as any leftover projects that may fill the bill, also the multitude of drum kits that I tend to use for my tracks as E/E, which range from Progressive House all the way to other styles entirely.</p>
<p>This seems like a nice opportunity, and any chance to work with Stigmo again would be awesome.</p>

            <p>This is right up my alley, so obviously I’m interested.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what kind of music I make:</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/tundra" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/tundra</a><br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/sky-high" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/stigmomusic/sky-high</a></p>
<p>A sidenote: As I do not know how the coming months will unfold for me, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to contribute. This means that I might withdraw my application for this collab project. I’m interested in it nonetheless.</p>

            <p>This sounds like my sort of thing. I would describe my music to be mostly Melodic House.<br>
