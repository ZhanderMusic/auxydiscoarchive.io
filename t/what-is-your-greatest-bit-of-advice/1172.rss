            <p>Another important thing is to learn basic piano skills (I’m a guitar player) like chords and and how they are build from the root note up for example. For me as a guitar player that made it all clear, and since those days I never used a chord book again.<br>
It’s important to be able to read music, bit also do it the other way round: listen to the music and try to play it and write it down. That’s an invaluable skill. To be able to write down the music you compose. For yourself but also for other musicians do they can play it. Not only your music but also people’s music. As a practice, but you can for example also write down other singing voices, instrument lines etc.<br>
And also in that case playing the piano had been invaluable. Because add opposed to other instruments it really ready to learn where the notes are on the piano, it’s like a map of all notes. And it also translates real easy to the notes you read and write down.<br>
And last but not least: once you start recording music using a sequencer, you almost use a piano keyboard to play the other instruments using midi.<br>
To me all the things I had trouble with understanding on the guitar became so clear once I started playing the piano to, note reading and writing a piece of a cake, it has been really helpful when recording using s sequencer.<br>
Plus it’s just plain real fun to be able to play piano too and play piano music of your guitar and vice versa.</p>

            <p>My greatest bit of advice is to actually be able to read and understand music. Get classical training, or better yet, legitimately play a musical instrument. I’ve been playing brass for about twelve years now. This has helped me immensely with my musical structure. Another word of advice is to find a style you like and copy the heck out of it, until you eventually morph it into your own. I’ve been listening to Hideki Naganuma’s works for the longest, I’ve been trying to emulate that sound forever: still not there yet. Keep trying.</p>

            <p>That’s a great piece of advice. You should create music for the love of it. Not to get as much love as possible from other people.<br>
Creating music for the love of it, is a powerful thing. It can help you through the darkest and the lightest times.<br>
Just create the music you would wanna hear. And be patient. Some things may take a while.<br>
But keeping it simple sure helps a lot!</p>
