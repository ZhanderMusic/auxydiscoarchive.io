    <description>Hey guys n gals,

I sampled a sound from Auxy and can’t find where I got the sample from and I want to post the edit I did with his/her permission.

Please check out the track below. The sample is the main riff chord.

Thanks ever so much

Hey guys! So I was going through some of my Auxy projects and figured that some of you may want some projects for your own personal use, so I’m gonna put all of my unused projects in this topic, and if I have more to…

<p>But to conclude this thread, yes, you can use the bass riff I made <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/3.png?v=10" title=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t3:"></p>

            <p>I believe <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/matik">@Matik</a> is who you are looking for, pretty sure they went under that name previously.</p>
<p>(I mean considering he runs this account: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/creepzrecords" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/creepzrecords</a>)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/eza">@ezA</a> Yeah I  checked out the name and searched on Auxy’s forum and couldn’t find the post. I did find someone named creepz but it isn’t him/her as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Perhaps they got the sample from someone else…either way I’d rather get permission to use it if I can.</p>
