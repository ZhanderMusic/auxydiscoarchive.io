Found an old version of the app on iPad. Live recording is something I equally miss, as well as resent. Bad, because you have to scramble to press your loops and I remember having these 9 minute epics. I mean, I aimed for 3 minutes and that didn’t happen at all.

But it was also good, because you’re having a load of fun. I spend way longer on tracks in the new app these days, cutting and refining. It keels me.

So this was good to relax with.</description>

            <p>I’m glad you kept these oldies around; it was good perspective.  There’s something about a live mix that I hadn’t fully appreciated before, and I’ll definitely be taking more sanity breaks with this app in the future.</p>

            <p>I do have quite a few up — though I thought I deleted them. Murdering Fairies and everything after that are my oldies.</p>
<p>Dude! I keep sliding my finger across the screen to write multiple notes in the new app even now.</p>

            <p>Thanks!!  If you have any back-in-the-day green-icon-auxy tracks lurking around, I’d be curious to check them out.</p>
<p>I noticed three features that I miss:  1) single-bar looping, 2) you can slide in the loop editor to get (for example) a bunch of consecutive 32nd notes without having to enter them individually, and 3) real time counter on playback.</p>

            <p>Yo that was cool! It was chill and creepy at the same time, and I liked how you worked that bass!</p>

            <p>Great minds think alike!  I enjoyed listening to this; it’s fun hear what you sound like in real time, with 4 instruments and one-shot recording.</p>
<p>In case you’re interested, here’s some of my own <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wagneric/20180516-0932mdt-517rmx/s-nEEJ1" rel="nofollow noopener">re-exploration</a> of this app last week.  Started out with some industrial sensibilities but wandered off after a couple minutes when I accidentally added bass back in with the settings all wrong.  So much fun (and panic, once you hit record).</p>
