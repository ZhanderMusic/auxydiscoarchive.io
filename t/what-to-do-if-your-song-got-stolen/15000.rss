    <title>What to do if your song got stolen 😐</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-to-do-if-your-song-got-stolen/15000</link>
    <description>So not too long ago I posted a song called “Sing with me” &amp; I’m just now finding out that someone had stole it &amp; put on there album. I don’t know why someone feels the need to steal my music when I worked so hard on it 😓

Any ideas on how to go about this?</description>

            <p>Hi everyone - back to original point of this thread, if someone has plagiarized your work your best recourse is to notify the owners of the platform you found it on. Most take this stuff very seriously and will take corrective action. It’s not a good look for this to get de-railed beyond that original inquiry. Thanks!</p>

            <p>He said the “song and its samples were distributed with a non commercial license.” This is technically incorrect. You can do what you want with the actual project, but the actual song is still totally protected by copyright unless you specifically made it non commercial. The feed projects do not give you any rights to post any form of the original song whatsoever. It’s the project, and the project ONLY that is free to use (as in mess with) and share. No audio /music usage rights are granted.</p>

            <p>Boy what an ass. He says basically how important his work is to him, but I guess it’s ok to completely rip off other people. Fantom 87 should just “get over his feelings” right?</p>
<p>“When developing my album, two of the tracks, the second a remastered version of the first, I used a royalty-free sample pack provided by Auxy, the app I in part use to make my music. I hadn’t realized that this ‘pack’ was actually a song of the artist Fantom ’87”</p>
<p>Immediately followed by:</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear on one thing: my intent was never malicious and all of my songs belong to me and have been mixed, mastered, produced, and developed by me.”</p>
<p>Yeah??? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>

            <p>Yes there’s tons of stuff like this that goes on and really the only thing you can do is report it to the website. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> however, that means someone found your song good enough for them to want it to be their own!</p>
<p>Plagiarism starts really early in a producer’s career but yeah they don’t benefit much from it. Plus you get a bit used to it after a while.</p>

            <p>If its on YouTube, just copyright strike them (if that’s possible). Let them gain no profit out of it. Cause I would do that if I knew how to.</p>

<p>a better way to protect your tracks is to not select “include remix link” when uploading so people can’t see and copy your projects. but nothing can be done about the featured projects</p>

</aside>
<p>I think this is a bit of a misconception though. We only release cut down versions of featured tracks now so it’s not as simple as just exporting them. If you want to steal a track from someone you can just rip the audio from SoundCloud or wherever that track is posted.</p>
<p>My general suggestion is to report a stolen track to the platform is uploaded on. If someone stole a track and has very few followers and plays, then I wouldn’t care that much. If something blows up though, that’s when you bring out the lawyers to reclaim it.</p>
