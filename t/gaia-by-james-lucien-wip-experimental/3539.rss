Got a spicy demo here, which i&#39;d consider to be pretty experimental at a 7/8 time signature. Yes, it was difficult to compose.

Currently having trouble with some of it but I have an idea of how it could flow so I wanted to get some feedback on it. Aside from layering (I haven&#39;t layered it yet, this is about the notes themselves).</description>
