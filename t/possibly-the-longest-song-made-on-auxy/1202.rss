            <p>I was close to make a 9 minute trap song, but it…destroyed my storage, so I deleted it; oh well. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

            <p>True, but this song isn’t that repetitive, there’s quite a lot of movement happening; like subtle changes and automation. This is a job well done for a chill out song. Great for setting the mood in the background while you do other things and also great for 100% relaxing, closing your eyes and letting the vibes take you.</p>

            <p>I mean when I had the feels In the making of the song I knew It was going to be long. my goal was to make it ten minutes. it was supposed to be progressively long, because it is a chill out song. Of course ten minutes is long for a song but I wanted to be a little different and create a different style. before I made this I was listening to a lot of progressive songs, it made me want to make something that felt like what this song makes me feel. I understand the length was long but in my situation this is what I wanted to do.  honestly I encourage others to do this also. it made me really think about it and it was a learning experience that I really enjoyed. It got me out of my comfort zone and helped my enjoy creating music a little more.</p>

            <p>A ten minute song really stretches the listener’s attention span. If you keep it repetitive, they’ll likely shut it off after about 2 minutes. Keep it shorter, pro tip <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
