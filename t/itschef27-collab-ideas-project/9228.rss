    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/itschef27-collab-ideas-project/9228</link>
    <description>I‚Äôm trying to make a song with some spy/going undercover vibes and I was wondering if anyone was up to helping me out, collab, etc. I would like some suggestions on where the song should go, as I need help putting ‚Äúmore‚Äù to it. 
If you do decide to help, please try to use not as many sounds from Auxy premium as I can‚Äôt play around with them yet. üëç
