    <title>Why Producer Names? </title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/why-producer-names/13648</link>
    <description>Sup homies.  

I&#39;m new to the Auxy world and this forum.  I started using it just last week and found it crazy easy to wrap my head around it, and it&#39;s incredibly easy to bang out my ideas on the go.  I&#39;ll probably be dropping my first track next week or so.  :v:

One thing that is interesting is that pretty much everyone goes by a &quot;producer name&quot; here.  Other than for the sake of privacy on the forum, what&#39;s the other advantages for going by a producer name?  Most of my bros just go by their real name.</description>

            <p>It’s interesting to see what artists went by a real name and a producer name as well. Both Michael Jackson and Phil Collins went by their actual names, but as you noted there are many that don’t. I think it also has to do with creating a sort of brand recognition. Although to be fair, Michael Jackson was Michael Jackson because of the Jackson 5, if that wasn’t the case perhaps that wouldn’t be the case.</p>

            <p>Lol, when I made a Xbox acc, I couldn’t think of a name. I also thought that 4 letter usernames were awesome. So I came up with this. People ask me what the meaning is, like, “ is it Extra Large?” But it has no meaning. Also it’s NOT my Auxy Disco Username, idk how to change that, it’s XLXK if it wasn’t clear by the Profile Pic</p>

            <p>I’ve stated why I made my name in another post some time ago, but to restate what I’ve said, the reason why my username is Azure Onyxscore is because they’re my favorite color combination. Azure=Blue, Onyx=Black.</p>
<p>The “score” in my username is left over from my previous username, LemonSpy_, the underscore is what I kept from that username and decided to use part of that word in my new username.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a>, thanks for the response.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=6" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> I’m playing with different ways to release my material including using an alias, using a project name specifically for Auxy stuff (eg. Mark Guiliana releases his original music under the project name “BEAT MUSIC”), etc.  So I was just curious about the reasoning behind everyone here.</p>
<p>Maybe I should change my name to “Ripper Johnson.”  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/laughing.png?v=6" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

            <p>The music industry is full of famous musicians who use an alias. They’re choosing a name to enhance their popularity, because - let’s face it - “Jason Brown” isn’t exciting.   (Sorry to anyone named Jason Brown). For example , Bruno Mars is actually Peter Gene Hernandez, etc.</p>
<p>In this forum, there’s a range of talent levels and many of us are casual bedroom musicians, so not everyone will want their real name to be known.</p>
<p>Is ripper your real name?  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   Welcome to the forum.</p>

            <p>Sup homies.</p>
<p>I’m new to the Auxy world and this forum.  I started using it just last week and found it crazy easy to wrap my head around it, and it’s incredibly easy to bang out my ideas on the go.  I’ll probably be dropping my first track next week or so.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/v.png?v=6" title=":v:" class="emoji" alt=":v:"></p>
<p>One thing that is interesting is that pretty much everyone goes by a “producer name” here.  Other than for the sake of privacy on the forum, what’s the other advantages for going by a producer name?  Most of my bros just go by their real name.</p>
