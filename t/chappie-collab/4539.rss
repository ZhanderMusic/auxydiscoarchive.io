    <description>I’ve just made a cool drop and I don’t know where to go with it, or what should go before. So if anyone would like to finish it, or take it somewhere, I would appreciate it. Just DM me and I’ll send you the project link. In a way, this is sort of a challenge. Whoever makes the best thing out of it wins! I’ll make a group of all the submissions (if I get more than 1).</description>
