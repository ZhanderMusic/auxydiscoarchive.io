    <title>Idea: Sound Pairing Chart/Thread</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/idea-sound-pairing-chart-thread/772</link>
    <description>For some novice/amateur producers, finding the right sounds for their music is difficult.  You essentially have to experiment with everything in Auxy to see what works and what doesn&#39;t work, and for someone like me, that alone is a painstakingly long process.

What if we made some kind of pairing chart that explains the functionality of each sound and beat in Auxy&#39;s catalogue, and also lists what works and what doesn&#39;t work with those sounds and beats?  It could not only streamline the process of making music, but it could also encourage more producers to experiment and find out more combinations of sounds to use!

Here&#39;s a template that we could use for cataloging, feel free to add to the list if you want!

**Sound/Beat Name:** Subway
**Description (What it sounds like):** Kinda sounds like a heavy synth.  Useful for if you want to make something akin to Darksynth-styled music.
**Pairs Well With:** Flag, Hour, Otter, Frame
**Optional Note:** I tend to set the pitch on Higher when it comes to Subway, but that&#39;s just personal preference.</description>

            <p>That’s true, but it’d be best if we can find pairings that everyone can agree with.</p>

            <p>Silk I think pairs well with  jelly, runner, strain, noir, grain, flick, face, body<br>
I think it’s just up to opinion</p>

            <p>Thanks for the contribution, Ocean!</p>
<p>Also, here’s another tip for using Silk: Try raising the Tone and Reverb layers all the way up, and lower Filter to two thirds.  This gives you a choir-esque sound similar to cathedral music!</p>

            <p>Sound/Beat Name: Silk<br>
Description (What it sounds like): Very light synth, used for future bass and really anything.<br>
Pairs Well With: Punch, Subway, Gossip, Otter<br>
Optional Note: I usually stack the layers, copying the instrument and having 1 play at the normal octave and one on the lower end to thicken the sound.</p>

            <p>It could work for a future update, but for now it’s more of a collective project that I thought about.  I’d like to see other producers add their own entries into the thread, and maybe we can put it all on a google doc for ease of access.</p>
<p>While I’m at it, here’s two more entries.  Feel free to correct me if you think that some of the pairings don’t work well or if there’s another pairing that I didn’t know about.</p>
<p><strong>Sound/Beat Name:</strong> Hour<br>
<strong>Description (What it sounds like):</strong> Hard to describe, think of Kairo (The video game) or Machinarium for this one.  It’s very ambient, and useful for drone-esque music.<br>
<strong>Pairs Well With:</strong> Stress (Raise Tone/Reverb), Bo, Panda (Raise Tone, lower Filter), Kiss<br>
<strong>Optional Note:</strong> When using Hour, it’s always a good idea to lower the Filter slider to a third and raise the Reverb and Tone sliders all the way up.  This gives you a more ambient noise to use for your song.</p>
<p><strong>Sound/Beat Name:</strong> Stress<br>
<strong>Description (What it sounds like):</strong> When the Tone slider is raised all the way up, Stress sounds like something out of a retro video game.  Useful for making 8-bit music.<br>
<strong>Pairs Well With:</strong> Hour<br>
<strong>Optional Note:</strong> When using Stress, you can make a sort of grainy effect in your song by raising the Tone and Reverb sliders all the way up (Make sure to mess around with Volume and Filter, as well) before adding as many notes as you can in the loop–as long as they’re separated by one space–and lengthening out all of them.</p>

<p>Maybe to utilize that option you can press and hold for 3 seconds on an instrument.</p>
