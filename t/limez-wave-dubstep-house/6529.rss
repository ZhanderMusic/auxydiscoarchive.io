            <p>Umm maybe you should think about a name change <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>According to some, you can’t beat the U</p>
<p>(Feedback inbound)</p>
<p>Woah that drop is sick! The beginning was kind of slow, that’s just what I thought. Great use of lobster. For me, the chord sounds during the drop could have been a little softer (hour or silk, maybe?) Other than that, this is awesome, I’m following for more.</p>
<p>For next time: I like to have only either my chords or bass playing at one time so I use volume automations to manage that. Sometimes when chords and bass play at the same time, the bass drowns out the chords. Also, there should be a larger difference in volume between the end of the buildup and the drop (my opinion) so maybe use some automations to go from quiet to loud.</p>
<p>Overall: Very litty song and woah I typed a lot</p>
