    <title>Questions - Hexx [Album]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/questions-hexx-album/12781</link>
    <description>So, I came out with this new album recently ( https://soundcloud.com/hexx-official/sets/questions ) and I wanted to know. What are your favorite song/songs from it?

(Personally, I’m very proud of the me and @Peregrihn collab. Also, is that a lizard in my boot was very different and pretty compared to the rest of the album. Kind of a relaxer)</description>

            <p>The beat and the dreamy melody are really nice together! The transitions are also well executed! The screaming synth seemed a bit off, because in my opninion it doesn’t really fit with the vibe of this track.</p>
<p>Great track, though!</p>

            <p>Wow! I really like this album.</p>
<p>Favorite Tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is that a lizard in my boot? : The old school beat and piano flows so wel together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of pie is this?: The trappy beat in combination with that xylophone really creates an awesome atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you recommend Nutella? : I like the high-pitched melody and the bassline a lot. I also like the rides you put in there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see I like some of the more chill tracks on this album. The more agressive tracks were good, but sometimes they got a bit too much for me.</p>
<p>Great album!</p>
