This is a horror song. It will be the longest song on the album. The 1st 2 minutes are normal. Then the next 2 minutes, the song fades away and then the rhythm is very quiet and slow. Then it outright becomes weird and kinda creepy. Then it will go back to normal. The artwork is what will make the song creepy! I hope you consider choosing me as a staff favorite, tell me if it’s bad to ask about getting picked.</description>
