            <p>Intro is neat. The snappy clap/snare is nice. Vintage Electric Piano works well. I don’t usually see that type of Instrument used for what it’s supposed to be used for. WOAH that came out of nowhere. Super tight build up! Pretty chords for the drop! Real awesome drop there. The wubby disturbing lead fits nicely after the drop. Kinda wish it went on for a bit longer. Awesome song all in all!</p>
<p>Uniqueness: 8/10<br>
Predictability: 7/10<br>
Complexity: 7/10<br>
Use of Instruments/Automation: 8/10<br>
Feeling: 8/10</p>
<p>Overall: 38/50</p>
