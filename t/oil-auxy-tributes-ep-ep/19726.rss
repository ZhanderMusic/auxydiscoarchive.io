    <title>OIL — Auxy Tributes EP [EP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/oil-auxy-tributes-ep-ep/19726</link>
    <description>Remember those demo tracks that came with the version of Auxy that was around maybe five years ago?

I do.

[After finding the demo project thread with those very same demos, I couldn’t help myself and remixed a few of them. Here they are.](https://soundcloud.com/oil-official/sets/auxy-tributes-ep)

Hope you enjoy, somewhat. While it’s not my best work, it’s more sentimental to me than anything. 

*Five years,* y’know?</description>
