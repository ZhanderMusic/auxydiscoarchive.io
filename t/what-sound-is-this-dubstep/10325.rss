(not the melodic dubstep drop but the full dubstep drop)</description>

<p>Lol but for that sound, idk what it actually is. Probably made in Serum. Kinda sounds like a heavily modded growl. Have never used Serum so idk what he’d done with it, but he’s done some tutorials/production streams on his YT channel, so maybe u could pick up some stuff there.</p>
