I made this over a year ago. I thought it would be a fun way to say goodbye to Auxy for a while. I&#39;ve pretty much completely developed my skills to begin making music with Logic. I&#39;ve got quite a way to go, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using Auxy as much as I have. (These recent tracks are all like a year old anyways.)

But I will keep producing and writing, so look out for more music, probably coming soon-ish!!! And, as I promised, back in ninth grade, to myself and those of you who read my track descriptions, THERE WILL BE AN ALBUM BY SUMMER OF 2021.

Thank you all for sticking with me on this epic journey. eohr out
