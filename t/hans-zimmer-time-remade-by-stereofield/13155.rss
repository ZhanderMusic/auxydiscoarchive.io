    <title>Hans Zimmer – Time (Remade by stereofield)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/hans-zimmer-time-remade-by-stereofield/13155</link>
    <description>I know a couple of people were talking on here about remaking some of Hans Zimmer&#39;s music. I recently watched Inception and really liked the music so I decided to remake Time (most popular song) in Auxy. Enjoy!

As far as mixing goes, it&#39;s terrible, there&#39;s a _lot_ more high end in the original because of all the orchestral instruments and layering. The remix is a fairly simple as far as layering goes. In the original project, I have 3 chord layers:
- Hour for basic backing chords (lowpass automates in a crescendo a.k.a. very slow wub ;) every 4 bars)
- Sweet Saw for higher frequency plucks (very slight lowpass automation, and the melody is somewhat mirrored into the chords)
- Viola Section for strings (tried to make it sound like real strings, which was kinda hard. automated in a crescendo every 4 bars)


The only drums are a filtered Bulldog impact backbeat (comes in at the beginning, and then around 3:03) and then some clock ticking effect from the Pacific kit at the end.

Overall, there isn&#39;t much variation in the song just because the original is the same way. Hans Zimmer is really good at _not_ having variation and yet making it sound _really good_ – I&#39;m not. Ehh, I tried.

Hope you enjoy it ;) let me know what you think</description>

            <p>Had to listen to the original first, haven’t seen Inception in a super long time. You did a great job capturing the essence of the original while using your own sound palette to compliment the flow of the track.</p>
<p>An electric guitar sample brought in from outside woulda been cool, but kudos for keeping it all inside Auxy I wouldn’t even say it detracts from it, I’m just a sucker for guitar.</p>

            <p>Sounds awesome. I really like it. I know it’s a cover, but I love your more ambient orchestral style. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
