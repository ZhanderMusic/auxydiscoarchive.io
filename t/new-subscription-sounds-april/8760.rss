            <p>I would love having the features of a standard Daw</p>
<p>Right now I think that auxy is the most powerful Daw on mobile…</p>
<p>However adding a lot of the features (don’t even need all of them, just the major ones) From Fl studio or abelton, would make it one of the best Daw on computer and mobile, even without all of the features, because the workflow of auxy is better than that of professional Daw.</p>
<p>I do not think that this would take away from what makes auxy so good, because auxy is awesome for the workflow and the easy to understand interface. More powerful features could be accessed like chromatic is turned on. A begginer will probably not produce in chromatic, so will probably not turn on the extra features.</p>
<p>In conclusion adding features of a professional Daw will enable professional tracks to be made on mobile, That previously would sound like they came from a major studio.</p>

<p>There’s some dubstep-like basses already but they are limited in use and there aren’t very many, especially because a good dubstep song would require many different sounds</p>

<p>I’m inclined to agree here, though perhaps for slightly different reasons.</p>
<p>It’s possible, maybe even likely, that ‘the kind of users’ who would make use of such features would be the kind of users most likely to help <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> achieve their goal of fostering ‘a revolution in music making’, which <s>presumably</s> ideally means creating a breakthrough track using Auxy.</p>
<p>Additionally, features that dramatically extend the shelf-life of native sounds helps extend the usefulness and relevance of Auxy to musicians as they grow.</p>

            <p>Completely agree with this and what billposters said. As a musician who spends a lot of time messing around on Auxy, I would <em>love</em> at least a tiny portion of ADSR support. In Logic Pro X, there’s a synth called Alchemy which has full built in ADSR support. Plus, that synth supports sound import as well. I’d love to see a <strong>fraction</strong> of that in Auxy. Maybe just the attack and decay features, as the note length would work well with the sustain. It does frustrate someone like me to even see this conversation happening, because I believe that creators should indeed listen to the suggestions that their users are giving. This is a very tight-knit community, but I’d feel it would be a huge shame to not want to interact more and allow us as musicians to continue to do what we do best on a beautiful app such as this.</p>

<p>there are five or so people extensively debating adding lots of features that are common in DAWs</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Five users out of around fifty to seventy-five or so regularly active users is a large percentage. It’s nothing to disregard, which is what seems to be happening. At least from a perspective as someone who’s becoming more and more frustrated with the direction of the app, basic features that could expand the system greatly isn’t something trivial.</p>
<p>I think the more important thing to address is features that, as <strong><em>musicians</em></strong>, are important. As a musician, increased control over how an instrument sounds is a no-brainer. If it’s too complex, people won’t use the feature, but that doesn’t make it not valuable or valid as a suggestion. As an <em>option</em>, rather than a <em>requirement</em>. To be completely honest, the fact that users are required to layer sounds to achieve better sound quality is rather complex to begin with, is it not? Would it not be simpler to simply be able to adjust the way the sound plays, rather than adding more sound onto it to try and make it sound different? For some, it would definitely be easier. For others, not so much.</p>
<p>Even just basic attack and release controls would be nice, that way some sounds can be properly layered as well. Silk’s shape meter changes the attack at a higher rate than most other sounds, making it <em>much</em> harder to layer. A simple way to adjust this equally among instruments would be easier to layer, which seems to be an important part of making Auxy sound good at this point.</p>

<p>Although adding these features would open up some possibilities, it would also mean a lot of what’s making Auxy good could get lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Thanks for taking the time to dive into the commentary. And thanks for responding.</p>
<p>I understand the point and I agree – <em>to an extent</em>.<br>
The majority of users will likely remain satisfied with the current approach to controls. No point making it more difficult for them.</p>
<p>That’s why I think much of what’s being discussed could be supported as a second tier of per-instrument/sound controls. (Though, imo, Attack and Release could easily sit comfortably alongside Tone, Lowpass, Ducker, etc… as, conceptually, they’re both very easy to comprehend.)</p>
<p>Plus, as mentioned, it would effectively expand the library of sounds by several magnitudes as every sound could be used as plucks, leads, pads, …. Seems a relatively cheap way to get much more mileage from the same number of native sounds.)</p>

            <p>I read (most of) the feedback and think about what we can do to expand and improve quality. Let me just point out that in my view, there are five or so people extensively debating adding lots of features that are common in DAWs. Although adding these features would open up some possibilities, it would also mean a lot of what’s making Auxy good could get lost.</p>

            <p>I’m guessing they’re not, because last month they added Organic Elements 2 and the Orchestral Strings (or maybe it was the guitars idk. My point is, they seem to add percussive and melodic sounds every month).</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> Since it seems you’re online right now, just curious, are the rimshots the  only pack this month?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I actually love them just wondering</p>

            <p>Yup - and I remember someone suggested using automation to achieve the same effect but the ADSR applies on a <em>per note</em> basis where the automation effects all notes so it’s not a good solution. Even just a new pop out like the delay box with four knobs would suffice</p>

<p>It’s definitely a quick win for sound design effectively increasing the usability of the sounds as they exist now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve made exactly that point directly to Lenberg some time back.<br>
As you say, in principle*, it’s a relatively easy way to effectively expand the number of available sounds exponentially. A real <em>force multiplier</em>.<br>
(Iirc, it didn’t get a response.)</p>
<p>Imo, it’s such an easy win, with such obvious and immediate benefits that, presumably, only a objection to the principle of that kind of experience would prevent it from going on the roadmap.</p>
<p>Again, a great candidate for those 2nd-tier power features that we’ve been alluding to.</p>
<p>However, comments he made at the start of the year suggest that he considers repackaging a handful of existing sounds to be a more preferable (easier? cheaper?) solution than user-definable ADSR that exponentially increases all sound options.</p>
<p>It’s encouraging that he’s recognising the demand, but it’s not a very promising sign to those who see universal ADSR controls as the right solution.</p>
<p>* I suspect they’ve kinda painted themselves into a corner with their approach to shaping tools and introduction of pre-trig to compensate for the approach they’ve taken.<br>
Pre-trig is clever, but it seems like a band-aid solution for a problem they should probably fundamentally readdress. As painful as it might be to extricate themselves from this position - certainly a non-trivial thing - I think an overhaul and re-simplification of the shaping system (around common ADSR principles) could get the app back onto a path where more things are possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Just noticed that last month’s version of this thread also ended up going into this topic.)</p>
