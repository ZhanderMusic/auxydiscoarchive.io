    <title>Introducing Auxy 6: Big Updates to Instruments and Effects</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/introducing-auxy-6-big-updates-to-instruments-and-effects/16145</link>
    <description>We&#39;re excited to share this major update that will take your instruments to the next level!

#### What&#39;s New:
- Lots of new options for tweaking sounds and effects
- All sounds can now have distortion, chorus and EQ
- All drum kits can now have delay, distortion, compressor, EQ and ducker
- Delay amount can now be set individually for each sample
- Notes and automation can now be moved freely when editing
- Sounds and samples can now be browsed by category
- Samples can now be imported straight from other apps
- We have fixed a number of bugs and issues

#### Updating Sounds in Existing Projects
Your existing projects will use the same sounds as before and you will have an option to update each sound and unlock the new options via the tweak panel. Note that there&#39;s no need to update sounds unless you want to continue working on a project with the new sound options. If you&#39;re happy with a project, you risk messing up your mix when updating a sound since the new version will behave differently. It&#39;s better to create a new project and start exploring the new versions.

            <p>Best update in a long time but I really don’t like how the instrument selection has been panned out, it’s harder to find the drums I want because the favourites are just listed in the packs rather than the type of drums</p>
<p>Am I the only one who thinks the previous “favourite drums” selection was better?</p>

            <p>Okay that’s actually some advice but the demo sounds that auxy replaced were so last year. And also we will help them get more money I mean how the heck can we find a solution? Also I made a topic called “Do you have ideas for Auxy 7?” You can make your ideas here &amp; just forget about this. Also btw I’m not agitating you &amp; being unreasonable here I’m just trying to make you understand what I’m trying to say.<br>
The more we buy the one month subscription, the less Auxy will get money from that but the one year subscription. Holy moly you won’t believe how much Auxy can get if more of us spend it. Look you can come to my topic &amp; see this guy “Davis9754” make the better idea for the Auxy 7 update. He said somewhere “Empty Kit has been re-unlocked for free users” &amp; when he said that I got the feeling of the future of Auxy. Also the thing is that…we have to bring one of the greatest songs that  mvtt made as the next copyrighted project. If we don’t have money to buy the subscription then peep this. We have to copy the sounds of drums from every project people made. Auxy has a YouTube channel and they can get money there so what was the big deal about this whole thingy. Anyways I wanna give you this. <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/v_RklsMVoCScfJ_5e3lPdw==" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/v_RklsMVoCScfJ_5e3lPdw==</a></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your advice. I appreciate it all. Hope you have a legit blessed time. Thanks!! May Allah Bless you all!!!</p>

            <p>The devs whole purpose of the demo sounds is to limit your ability with the demo and to give you a taste of the subscription. Their hopes is that you see what you can do with the subscription and that you eventually buy it. Yes this is a music production app but it’s also a business, and they need money to continue to function. Their only way to get money is through the subscription, and if they add more demo sounds, it gives more people a reason to not get the subscription, and that leads to less money.</p>

            <p>The new demo sounds should be Azid,Grit,Breath,8080,Helix,Empty Kit,Sweeper,Crude,Tax,Ghost,Good Vibes,Bass Zone,Cello Staccato &amp; Jelly. (Favorite sounds I use in some of my songs.) Yours? Also half the samples should be from transcendent trap 2 &amp; original drums (you know why.) Because when we get the Empty Kit back for free on Auxy 7,we should have these samples to master up our demo game.</p>

            <p>Same with me, using a 6s if that helps.</p>
<p>There’s also a bug where rearranging the instruments will cause all the instruments to shift down a little, which can be fixed by rearranging the loops itself by one space.</p>

            <p>Cool update, but maybe you want to add <em>more</em> drum effects.</p>
<p>Before, you had effects like shape on drums, although it is nice that to took back distortion and compression.</p>
<p>See if you can bring <em>all</em> of the effects back.</p>
<p>That would be cool.</p>

            <p>Impressive update lads, does well to spark one’s creativity and I continue to anxiously await the arrival of the newest sound packs.</p>
<p>Not trying to be overly critical but wanted to suggest things that would be keen for 6.1</p>
<p>Collapsible menus in the new category section of the drums &amp; samples.</p>
<p>The appearance of Attack &amp; Release and Glide in automation.</p>
<p>Some way to shortcut finding notes when opening an instrument in use.</p>
<p>A multi-scene edit option with it’s own tweaks &amp; knobs.  These could even be dropped occasionally in lieu of new sound packs.</p>
<p>Your replies and feedback are always welcome</p>
<p>Keep up the grand work!!</p>

            <p>Because of the sound changes, I can’t get used to the new tweaks that now cannot replicate the original sound, similar to what happened to Gossip when Auxy became universal to iOS, no one used it.</p>
<p>And like you mentioned before, you gave up on some projects because you weren’t able to replicate A5 sounds. I unfortunately have to abandon <em>a lot</em> of projects because of this alone. As if my artist’s block wasn’t bad enough, now this update really placed the last nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>This might be the first time for me that adding too much at the same time actually destroyed my productivity. Now I kinda regret renewing my subscription.</p>
<p>If only I could downgrade to something I genuinely enjoyed.</p>

            <p>Kind of a bummer, but I get it. I’m kinda glad I had no projects so that I didn’t have to deal with this, everything was just fresh and used the new sounds.</p>

            <p>I thought perhaps I was the only who has noticed that it’s not just strings but many sounds, no matter how much I tweak the settings, can’t seem to replicate their original sound.</p>
<p>Player Two from games waves. I spent hours the other day trying to replicate the distorted static that I have in previous songs. The distortion was higher in pitch and more atmospheric. Couldn’t do it. Gave up and just resigned to the fact that these sounds will need to be treated as completely new sounds with their own ‘limitations’.</p>

            <p>It’s not just the attack it’s also the amount of offset, glide and especially chorus.</p>

            <p>is this where i should post glitches i’ve found? if so then i’ve found a visual glitch where you know how the notes turn white when the bar which goes through the loops hits them in the loop? the white bits were delayed. i took a video and uploaded it to youtube so you can see: <a href="https://youtu.be/-V5slZ-k_Bk" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/-V5slZ-k_Bk</a><br>
anyone else ever experienced this? it’s my first time</p>

            <p>I don’t know where I can show the goofs this app has, but frankly, i’m not in the mood to do so.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some keys sound quieter/louder than the rest of the instrument<br>
<a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/u8R0kuaDkNLX6v_Kr5W_Eg==" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/u8R0kuaDkNLX6v_Kr5W_Eg==</a><br>
The strings on this one is the main issue in this project. The highest string sounds quieter than the rest of the instrument.</li>
<li>Strings don’t sound as seamless as before<br>
<a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/sJ3HoYVQlODnKvjNgay6eg==" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.auxy.co/projects/sJ3HoYVQlODnKvjNgay6eg==</a><br>
The top instrument is using an old version of Cello Section while the bottom uses the new version. Even changing the attack and release doesn’t make the strings sound seamless as before</li>

            <p>Yes, you can copy the old sounds like how you can copy the legacy drum kits.</p>

            <p>Fair enough - I can’t imagine they’re gonna give the option to flip back and forth. Does anyone know if you copy an old sound from an old project to a new project if that works? Cause they do update per sound per project, so maybe that works?</p>
