    <title>Anyone ever try making a Japanese electronic style song</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-ever-try-making-a-japanese-electronic-style-song/12381</link>
    <description>About a few months ago, I discovered this guy named Camellia, and he is quite the artist, making multiple subgenres like hardcore, trance, dubstep, speedcore and a lot more.

Then I found t+pazolite, who&#39;s just crazy with his songs, and with those two discovered, I tried making a song based off theirs.

Spoiler: It ended up pretty bad :joy:

But anyways, has anyone ever tried doing a Japanese style?

[spoiler]There&#39;s a lot of TouHou remixes, there too, also tried to recreate, ended up needing a 3/4 time signature :&#39;)[/spoiler]  

There&#39;s a reason why this is in the random category</description>

            <p>i wouldn’t say most. There’s def a handful that are in a similar style, but most are actually tracks that can fit on a sheet of music without looking like a black square.</p>
<p>And i’ve seen that vid before (and i’ve watched a lot of black midi in my life).  The touhou black midi’s in that aren’t the actual tracks.  There usually is piano, but the whole track usually isn’t all piano.</p>
<p>Example: the actual track that was shown as a black midi from touhou:</p>

            <p>That’s also kinda ignoring the fact that most TouHou games, and bullet hell games in general, are black midi tracks.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, tempo changes and crazy fast notes like that aren’t within Auxy’s capabilities (at the moment), for sure. All I was saying is that it is possible to get 3/4 time in Auxy.</p>

            <p>I mean, I’m trying to remake t+pazolite’s Garakuta Doll Play in FL Studio, which is pretty easy, but I haven’t heard of any signature changes in any of his songs (yet).<br>
Most the song’s I’ve listened to are TouHou remixes in 4/4, but when I tried to remake U.N. Owen Was Her?, the appregio part at the beginning were a 3/4, but speaking of <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/notmiles">@NotMiles</a>’s triplet thing, I found it pretty confusing to do actually.</p>
<p>But who knows? We might unironically have a Japanese producer walk in the community!</p>
