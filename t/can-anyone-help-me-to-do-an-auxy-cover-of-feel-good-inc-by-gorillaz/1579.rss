            <p>I was hesitant to share this with you guys because I worked on it for so long, but I trust you guys. I canâ€™t have no right if owning it so I think it is right to share it with you guys. Itâ€™s a good learning experience to see how the gorillaz did it in the pastðŸ˜„</p>

<p>I compensated the voice with one of the noisesâ€¦ because auxy canâ€™t add voices yet.</p>
<p>I tried to be so perfect when I did this. I havenâ€™t worked on it for a while but when I was working on it I was working on it way too muchðŸ˜„ I probably played the song 100 times for the first 10 seconds to make sure I got it right. Youâ€™ll notice on some parts itâ€™s different. I thought that was cool, because it was really hard to notice them when you just listen to the song. I really got to understand and notice all the complexity of the song.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and donâ€™t be afraid to add on if you feel like itâ€¦ you wouldnâ€™t be copyrighting meðŸ˜„</p>

            <p>Lol. I did the same thing. It is on my iPad so when I get home Iâ€™ll show you how I translated it. Though I think I used a different song from gorillaz.</p>

            <p>Alright. So, Iâ€™ll just list everything off.</p>
<p><strong>Bass:</strong> Panda<br>
<strong>Drums:</strong> Dust<br>
<strong>Verse Melody:</strong> Otter (<em>Cityâ€™s breaking down on a camelâ€™s backâ€¦</em>)<br>
<strong>Chorus:</strong> Runner, Story, Morning (<em>Windmill, windmill, for the landâ€¦</em>)<br>
<strong>Bridge:</strong> Bow<br>
<strong>"Feel Good":</strong> Gossip<br>
<strong>Key:</strong> Eb<br>
<strong>Tempo:</strong> 140<br>
<strong>Scale:</strong> Minor</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t say it was 100% accurate. Just a version of it, but itâ€™s close enough.</p>
