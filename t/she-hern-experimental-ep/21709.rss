    <title>She - Hern [Experimental EP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/she-hern-experimental-ep/21709</link>
    <description>I decided to finally post this material as an EP since I’ve not known what to do with it for so long, the EP only features one new track that hasn’t already been a single. This is meant to be a pretty unsubstantial release and just me needing to get this out there is some official capacity.

Link is here (Runtime - 30:33) - https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/4vwWid1roUwBarkk9

Hope you guys enjoy, constructive criticism is always welcome.</description>

            <p>I feel like it’s way too cluttered and loud. It has potential, but it’s a bit… earkill.</p>
