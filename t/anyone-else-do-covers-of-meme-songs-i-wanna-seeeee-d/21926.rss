    <description>Hey all! This is my first post on here. I’ve been doing auxy stuff for about 3 or 4 years. I don’t remember exactly,  but I am a singer-songwriter who is… honestly kind of a mess  when it comes to learning about music but would still love to learn more and grow as an artist on here. 
Anyway:
I did different versions of Astronomia (Coffin Dance) a while back. Here are the links.
