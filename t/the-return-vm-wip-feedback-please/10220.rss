Hey community, this is a song I’m working on right now called “The Return”. It has an odd story, actually. Just the other day I was experimenting with a beat I made, and I came up with a tune for it using the new pack, disturbing leads. I thought the tune was good, but I ended up ditching the beat and the disturbing leads in the process. The song now sounds “Kinda sad, but hopeful”, as described by my younger sister. What do you think can be improved? I would love to know 😃.
