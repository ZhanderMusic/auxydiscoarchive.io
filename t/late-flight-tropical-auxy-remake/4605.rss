    <title>Late Flight - Tropical Auxy Remake</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/late-flight-tropical-auxy-remake/4605</link>
    <description>Hey guys. Have you ever used the old Auxy app? Well I have it on my ipad because I couldn’t download the newer Auxy due to it being a 3rd Gen. But I brought back Late Flight as the same as usual. I just took the main track and put it together. 

I played around and couldn’t think of any parts but I can send you the link to the Auxy Project if you want to mess around with it. I already have all the main parts in the project so if your feeling bored or something I have a project for you.

Hope you enjoy this two minute-half song that the old Auxy app has brought to us back then.

            <p>Thanks. I know they didn’t bring all the sounds back from the old version, so I just used the closest one that I could find.</p>

            <p>Instruments from the original soundpack you mean. Lol tbh that was really good considering you only had those options. Well made</p>

            <p>It sounds crappy because I only used the parts that Auxy gave to the app. (That didn’t make much since.)</p>
