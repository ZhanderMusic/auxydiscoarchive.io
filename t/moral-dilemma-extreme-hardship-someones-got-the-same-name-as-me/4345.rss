    <title>Moral Dilemma, Extreme Hardship: Someones got the same name as me</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/moral-dilemma-extreme-hardship-someones-got-the-same-name-as-me/4345</link>
    <description>So the first time I did a name check on TMÄR I didn&#39;t find anything and I was pretty stoked about that. But then I decided to look a little deeper on Facebook and I found a guy under &quot;Tmar&quot;. He&#39;s way more established than I am, 3.5k likes, verified on Facebook, copious amounts of music, the job lot!

Its not the worst thing in the world cause the only track I&#39;ve released was the  BTC we have just had. But its still an absolute pain in the sweed cause I&#39;ve already had my username changed on here when I first joined and, Id rather not do that again cause I know that can cause problems for the big dogs running the Auxy.

I think I might have to bite the bullet and just change my Soundcloud name to something else. 
What would you guys do in this situation?</description>

            <p>You’re correct in saying that,  no one can actually copyright a name however if the name belongs to a trademark thats when things get messy but I could be overthinking it too much</p>
