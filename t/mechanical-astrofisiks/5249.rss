    <description>This isn&#39;t really new, but I was wondering what you all think of this song? I tried something with The Future, pack, and I think it came out pretty good, but I want to get some feedback.

Sorry I forgot the link before

            <p>Hey! Before I review, remember hat none of this is against you or to offend you, but to help you get better at creating music and making better choices next track. Sorry if I seem a little harsh at points, again, nothing personal.</p>
<p>Intro is very cool. I heard a little tick right before the drums came in, be careful of those because they are very annoying, even if they don’t seem very noticeable. I wish the drums were a little cooler and maybe a bit heavier to match with the coolio vibe. I really love this melody that comes in, nice! When all that fades away, I think the instrument you bring in comes in way to abruptly with no warning or anticipation for it. Especially for how bassy it is, it was so unexpected. It would probably sound better if that was pushed in slowly. The chords that you made with the instrument aren’t very solid either (if they even are chords, it might just be 1 lines). Another thing I’d suggest is ducker on that bass. The next transition from that back into the main tune is still a bit weird and abrupt, but oddly I like it. It’s refreshing. And then later on you have that same bass-chord thing, and I just have the same feedback.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool and interesting song. It’s got a lot of head pumpers in there, and I’d love to see a longer (and improved) version. I followed you!</p>

            <p>I listened to the track, and first off I want to say that its pretty good. I do have some advice though for your future projects ( no pun intended). Whenever you have a bass instrument going, you usually want to stay away from having multiple notes going on in it at the same time (ex. chords). They usually don’t agree with eachother and make it sound kind of garbled.</p>
