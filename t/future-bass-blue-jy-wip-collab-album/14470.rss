    <description>hey guys
i started listening to future bass again and i tried to make it several times, but it always turns out terrible. i can&#39;t find the right sounds for chords or get the feel that I wanted to
i decided to do a collab album to help with this

anyone who wants to join, please pm me so i&#39;ll know

also if you can give tips on future bass it would help me out so much!! :slight_smile:
