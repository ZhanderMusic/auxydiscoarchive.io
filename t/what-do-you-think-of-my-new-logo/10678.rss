And I do somewhat agree. It’s kinda a cheap way to change stuff. But I still believe my point stands that the logo would look better if those things were added.</p>

            <p>That’s correct.</p>
<p>I think there are <em>very</em> few instances where reaching for a Photoshop filter will improve a logo.</p>

            <p>Just wondering, why would you want to have your art looking unprofessional. I get it for certain circumstances and occasional tracks, but I don’t see why it should be your standard logo.</p>

</aside>
<p>As a design professional, I can say that it’s not that black and white.</p>
<p>Shadows, glows, etc… are not innately unprofessional or signs of bad design choices. It’s down to how they’re used. Sure, sometimes, less is more. But similarly, brash, unsubtle effects are sometimes appropriate for the desired aesthetic (e.g. Punk art).</p>
<p>Depends what you’re going for.</p>
<p>If the outcome doesn’t match the intent, then that’s poor design (or poor briefing from the client).</p>

            <p>From a distance, this looks to be no problem, but I do see your perspective. I’d have to completely redo the logo in order to get rid of the shadow drop because I don’t have a save file of that version. Thanks for the tips <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">, I’ll try this later</p>

            <p>It looks too fuzzy with all that blur and drop shadow effects. I suggest possibly using a thicker and bolder font, or even lowering the opacity on the drop shadow, or possibly even adding a slight black to dark grey gradient filter on the text to not make it look completely plain and black.<br>
Those are just my suggestions though.</p>
