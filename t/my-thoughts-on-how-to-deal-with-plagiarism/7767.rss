    <title>My thoughts on how to deal with plagiarism</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-thoughts-on-how-to-deal-with-plagiarism/7767</link>
    <description>It&#39;s definitely an issue, no question. When I run into stolen tracks, I usually just send the person who posted them a PM and they take it down and apologize. It can even turn into a friendly conversation. :slight_smile:

What I *personally* son&#39;t think is necessary is chewing them out in public chats, threatening to attack their SoundCloud, etc. I&#39;ve seen some people do this, and it really doesn&#39;t help anything. If anything, it raises *more* attention to something that can be kept private in the first place! It also makes the person who said that look immature. 

If people will steal music more than once, *then* it&#39;s a bigger deal. At this point, I&#39;d send them a ton of comments, maybe even report them if it was serious.

What no one should ever do, never, is hate on people. There are better ways to deal with it. Hating gets no one anywhere and creates mistrust and hard feelings. We don&#39;t need that. 

Just needed to put this out there.

<p>People could rip the file off of SoundCloud or, if you accidentally put the remix link in the desc. of the song, people can steal it that way as well.</p>

            <p>I don’t release any project files or the stems to the public, and I don’t know many people who do.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about?<br>
How do people steal your tracks?</p>
<p>Ps. I don’t make songs in Auxy. When I do use Auxy, I just make like two loops and bounce them into my DAW (Ableton Live) which has more sounds.<br>
I don’t know if that makes a difference.</p>

            <p>I totally agree on this. When I started Auxy, and I had no clue about Auxy disco, I thought you could use the songs in the feed. So I kinda remixed Southborne’s track. He messaged me about it later nicely, and I took it down immediately.</p>
<p>Southborne ended up being one of my earliest followers and is still a big supporter of my really bad music. xD</p>
