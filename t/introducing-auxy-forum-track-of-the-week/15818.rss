    <title>Introducing... Auxy Forum Track of the Week</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/introducing-auxy-forum-track-of-the-week/15818</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt; 

Here comes a new Auxy forum competition. Anyone can enter. Starts in a few days.  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic will be posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered, post a Soundcloud link to your track before the topics due date. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced in the same topic. 
&gt; * Don&#39;t post tracks in this thread, as this is just the competition announcement. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be at least 60 seconds long. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week.
&gt;6. No collabs.
&gt;7. No remixes. 
&gt;8. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week. I will the the only judge initially, while we get the weekly contest started. My intention is to handover to someone more musically talented once the contest is established. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets an &quot;Auxy Forum Track of the Week&quot; icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a seperate Winner&#39;s thread.

            <p>How about for collabs, the producer who submits the song gets the recognition on the forum? If a collab would win, both artists would still get exposure from their song being the Auxy Song of the Week, but the person who took the responsibility of submitting their collab would get the recognition (It would also create an added incentive for artists to collaborate with one another. Maybe it would convince bigger artists to work with smaller artists. The smaller artist would submit their collab, and they‚Äôd get the exposure of having the Auxy TotW logo next to their name.)</p>

<p>How much is too much track time? Like over 5 minutes?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pretty flexible on that. Although, if a track is clearly not going to win, the judge may not listen to the full thing if it‚Äôs really long. ie: it may be obvious after a minute or two that it‚Äôs not the best submitted track of the week in which case they don‚Äôt need to listen to the whole thing, unless they‚Äôre enjoying it.</p>

<p>So no collaborations?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Saw the comments about collabs from yourself and Hydrans, but for now let‚Äôs keep it simple and avoid remixes and collabs. We might revisit that later, possibly.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/hydrans">@Hydrans</a> - it is track of the week, but it‚Äôs the artist who gets the recognition. Don‚Äôt want to deal with Mega-Collabs and consent of all involved artists etc. And if one person does 90% of the track - including all the ‚Äúgood bits‚Äù - the other collaborator(s) may not actually deserve track of the week. Lets not open that can of worms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why aren‚Äôt people allowed to submit remixes or collabs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too hard and time consuming to compare original to remix, to determine what was added. I had Collab in-scope originally, but realised we could end up with multiple people getting a Track of the Week icon each week, even if their part wasn‚Äôt great. Easier to just not include remixes and collabs and let people enter with their own talent.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the remixing rule, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. But for collaborations, I still feel like this rule is unnecessary. Why does it matter if multiple people win the award? I thought the award was for the best Auxy <strong>track</strong>, not the people who made it.</p>

<p>Longer is fine.  Just don‚Äôt want 30 second entries. That‚Äôs why it says ‚Äúat least‚Äù 60 seconds.</p>
