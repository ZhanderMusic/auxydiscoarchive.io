    <title>You And Me (with precious mae)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/you-and-me-with-precious-mae/19362</link>
    <description>This track has been on hold for some time. So my friend and I decided to make a lyrics for it (She did all the lyrics). So last night she just sent me the demo version then she recorded fully in her bedroom. And I was trying to fix the in Ableton since the track was a bit off the bpm but I decided to keep the Auxy version with it since I forgot all the key for it. The piano sound was actually a sample that I made with my MIDI and drag it to AUXY. The track came out good but still has it flaws. So this is the outcome of it.

            <p>Great stuff. Everything’s spot on (imo), apart from the drums.</p>
<p>Vocal is fantastic. Serious talent.</p>
<p>I recommend revisiting the drums. Not sure if it’s the kit sounds or the beat structure, but doesn’t feel like it’s quite working to me. The touches of swing/syncopation lack subtlety - especially when the whole vibe is so subtle.</p>
<p>It’s close though. Really close. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

</aside>
<p>If you export as an Ableton Live Set, it exports the stems and the midi, all together as an Ableton project.</p>
<p>Also look into ‘warping’ in Ableton. Should help bring things together.</p>
