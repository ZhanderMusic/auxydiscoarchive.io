    <title>Anyone play any instruments in real life?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-play-any-instruments-in-real-life/14998</link>
    <description>I play guitar, bass and keyboard, though I play guitar more. I have an otamatone, but that’s a little hard to get use to. It’s been 1 more years since I’ve played keyboard. 
I use to play violin in middle school, but I sadly never continued playing it. I played drums for a good few months, but I stopped since the person that would let me use their drum set moved away. 
I think that’s pretty much all the instruments I’ve ever played.</description>
