    <description>I imposed with Auxy application 
Imade music based on the image of a story in which incense flowed into japan 

The &quot;fragrant wood&quot; &#39;Nihonshoki&#39; reports 595 that in 595 the fragrant wood that became the raw material for incense washed ashore in Awaji Island first drifted ashore in Japan. &quot;In the summer of the 3rd year of Emperor Suiko&#39;s reign, when she was washed ashore on Awaji-shima Island in Jinsui, she was not aware of the fact that the island was so large ．Shimabito Jinsui, and instead, he was burning firewood on the furnace, burning it in a blaze of smoke in the distance, that is, he offered it as a different story.&quot; later

(Excerpt from &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;)

It&#39;s a super translation, but in a nutshell it says:. &quot;In April, the 3rd year of the reign of Empress Suiko (595), a large scale of Chinsui (fragrant wood) flowed down Awaji Island. The people of the island thought it was only driftwood, and put it in the furnace with wood, and in a moment a very fragrant smoke rose. Surprised by this, people presented this piece of wood to the Imperial Court.&quot;
