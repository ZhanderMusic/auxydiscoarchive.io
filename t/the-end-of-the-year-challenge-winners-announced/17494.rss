            <p>Yeah I get it, but I’m not worried about the people participating stealing it, I’d be worried for someone who isn’t active or doesn’t even have an account steal it.<br>
(Again, I don’t think anyone would want to steal my stuff, but I don’t want to run the risk, same reason I only post demo project files on the works in progress page.)</p>
