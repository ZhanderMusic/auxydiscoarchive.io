    <title>Why I Have Problem Making other Genres?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/why-i-have-problem-making-other-genres/12093</link>
    <description>I’ve asked this question to myself many times and thinking about it a lot, I wanna know the reason, I can’t create other genres. Every time I open Auxy I want to make a funky beat but I end up making Ambient every single time.. I want to hear some opinions, how do I get into other genres?</description>

            <p>+1 on all accounts. It’d be like forcing yourself to speak with a fake accent - use your real voice. It’s always going to shine through no matter what anyway.</p>
<p>When people are first learning, they’re going to experiment with a ton of different genres. Eventually, you’ll use other other genres to influence your sound, but you’ll integrate those elements into what is <em>your</em> sound.</p>

            <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a>. I personally find it best to harness and hone what comes to us intrinsically. Some people struggle to find their definitive style and others struggle to branch out. Perhaps, before trying to move on to other genres, you can learn to develop and perfect your skills in ambient music. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I pretty much make dnb a majority of the time but that’s because I love dnb and I enjoy making it, I don’t think it’s a problem focussing mainly on one genre.</p>

            <p>Why would you want to make other genres (if you’re not already doing it instinctively and it’s a struggle)?</p>
<p>Seems like Ambient is your <em>authentic</em> sound? Go with it.<br>
Focus on that, develop that and make great Ambient music.</p>

            <p>Do you start with your drums? Also, try using instruments that you’re unfamiliar with — perhaps turn the reverb down/off and use sounds that cut a little harder.</p>
