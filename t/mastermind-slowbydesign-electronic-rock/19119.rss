hey guys! 

This is my newest one - it has some interesting distorted drums and vocal samples interlaced into the main beat. I guess I&#39;d say it&#39;s Mr. Hahn influenced? 

Hope you guys dig it :) :+1:

(I posted this yesterday with my phone and I think I might&#39;ve messed it up.  So, I just went ahead and deleted that post.  Hope that&#39;s okay :)</description>

<p>Super common problem. The best you can do is A/B on as many pieces of equipment as you can get your hands on. Personally I use two sets of headphones, my vehicle, the television and a crappy mono bluetooth speaker. It also helps to mix in mono, though honestly in Auxy I’ve never had this been a problem for anything I’ve worked on. If you get a mix sounding good in mono, when you switch it back to stereo it <em>really</em> shines.</p>

<p>Yeah, honestly, I kinda feel the same way about the bass.</p>
<p>I tried messing with it a bit, but it fit snuggly with everything else - so I kept it.</p>

<p>Do you ever struggle with this balance?<br>
Do you know of a more efficient way to streamline the process?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I really like this track. The drums are on point. I think the bass feels a little too flat though and maybe some more experimentation with the sound could have made this a better track. It’s really nice overall though.</p>
<p>BTW, you can edit posts so you don’t have to delete them.</p>
