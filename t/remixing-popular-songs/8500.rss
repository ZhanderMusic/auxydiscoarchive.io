            <p>I posted this in another thread, but it’s also possible to legally remix songs on Apple Music or Spotify through the<a href="https://www.mixbank.com/">Mixbank</a> service provided by <a href="http://www.dubset.com/">Dubset</a>.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure that you will not have any legal issues, if you do not monetize anything that has to do with the remix. There are plenty of uploads of songs that are on youtube, but are not monetized. This is because, if you do not have a large follower base and you don’t get a lot of money through it, the artist will probably just not care at all. but don’t take my advice, i’m a NOT lawyer ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

            <p>wouldn’t recommend it. Big artists/labels tend to be pretty tight when it comes to remixes. And SoundCloud is the worst when it comes to that stuff too. They almost always side with the original creator/label</p>
<p>YouTube is a bit more lenient with that stuff tho.</p>

            <p>You can if cpurse create the remix, but uploading it anywhere could become an issue.  I guess you could try sending it to promotion YouTube channels and seeing if they’ll post it for you but I mean there’s no guarantee that that will work out for you either</p>

            <p>You can have legal issues.<br>
It’s never safe to do a bootleg of anything.</p>
