    <title>Suggestion for layering sounds</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/suggestion-for-layering-sounds/120</link>
    <description>I dunno bout everyone else, but I love layering sounds in Auxy. Rather than having to duplicate a pattern as many times as instruments that you want to play the pattern, it could made easier.   What if, in the piano roll editor, you could hit a button at the top to bring up a list of all additional instruments currently in your project? Then you could just check a box next to the ones you want to add the current pattern to (the instrument you opened the editor on would always be chosen and therefore not visible in the list) then when you go back to the main screen, all of your chosen layer instruments would have your newly created pattern available and active.  No duplicating and copyin/moving to other instruments necessary. You&#39;d also of course be able to hear them all as you edit the pattern further so they would be linked somehow.  I think this would really speed up workflows and also showcase how great the sounds are.  What does everyone think about this?</description>

            <p>On second thought, perhaps it’s best left alone. It would be more complicated.  Keep it simple</p>

            <p>This could certainly help for everyone who layers sounds a lot, but it would add additional complexity for everyone else. In a previous version we automatically created a duplicate loop when you dragged a loop between instruments. Perhaps that’s a way to improve this.</p>
