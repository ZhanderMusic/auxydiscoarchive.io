    <description>SO

here we are again with a new drum pack...
imo this one is a bit skimpy, and has some pretty unoriginal content, since i can probably find duplicates in Dusty Trip Hop or Leviathan...

*good reverby claps tho*...</description>

            <p>I’m pretty sure it’s not an actual pack, it’s just a drum add-on to Euphoric memories. The notification is worded differently from every other pack release ever, and it doesn’t come with a demo project.</p>

            <p>I think they’re neat, but there’s very little in it. Doesn’t add a whole lot of value. It’s got like 40 or so sounds? Like others have said, fairly neat pack, but hope it’s small due to other features coming along.</p>

            <p>Hoping the petite ness of this pack is due to nice juicy features coming soon. I’d much rather the time be spent there!</p>
