    <description>Been sitting on this for a while.
A direction I&#39;ll be exploring more…

…dark, wonky, lo-fi electronic beats.

            <p>Had some comments about the drums ruining the experience of the track.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my reply…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a simple pattern, low, a little bit aggressive, just a hint of hip-hop vibe, with a slightly dirty/raw production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to marry the low, raw, wonky yet aggressive synth with a simple beat that felt a little dirty with a slight, lazy,  but heavy hip-hop feel.</p>
<p>I think I got pretty close to that in Auxy and feel quite happy with the drums.<br>
(Sure, I could add more variety, and that’s a valid observation across all the drums in my stuff.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Would be great to hear any feedback specifically about the beats and how well you feel they work with the rest?</p>
<p>What would you change?</p>
<p>(Of course, I’m not necessarily going to change anything – though I might. I’d just like to know what others feel is right/wrong with the drums.)</p>

            <p>This is really cool! Do you think you could give some advice on how to write lo-fi? I’m trying to write a bit myself for something.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I will, for sure.</p>
<p>Getting to the point now where I’ve got (what I think are) several reasonably strong* pieces in several genres, so I might start splitting it off into separate identities.</p>

            <p>It’s a different kinda song. From the stuff I’ve heard. Very dark and slow. It’s very unique. Keep it up buddy</p>

            <p>Vangelis was never really my bag, though I like his work for the original Blade Runner, of course.<br>
That said, I don’t think I’ve ever given his stuff a proper listen. I’ll take your comment as a nudge. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Thanks. It’s as I suspected.<br>
Good to know.<br>
You’re right about needing to remove and repost it if you want a previously private track to appear fresh in Followers’ feeds.</p>
<p>I typically use private for my own convenience and rarely announce/share a private track - though it can be a good option for discreetly gathering feedback on very early pieces (although I quite like putting up my ‘sketches’ too [would be cool if more people did that, imo]).</p>
<p>I’ll use ‘private’ more cautiously from now on.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a> Checked my feed and it did not show up as a new track (didn’t show at all).   In fact, looking at the Tracks listing on your SC profile, which I believe is chronological activity (ie, uploads and re-posts in the order they occurred) this track shows up down below some of your more recent activity (right below your re-post of my song which was sometime in early December - thanks BTW <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">).  So perhaps, if uploaded as private and you want it to show up in the feed, maybe remove it first, then re-upload it to SC as a new track?  Only problem is that you would lose any comments, likes, plays, etc for the private upload - if that matters to you.</p>

            <p>Dig this track my dude…very different from what most are posting on disco. Love the experimentation with the sounds (pushing the envelope or “beating into submission” as <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> stated <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> ) …and getting them to work together in a coherent track.  Have you been listening to Vangelis (circa 1988) lately?  Definitely has that feel for me.  But I can also see the Aphex Twin comparison.</p>

            <p>SC app not behaving at moment, on the train home and trying to load.</p>
<p>Gonna keep checking and just edit this when it comes up last update was six hours ago <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT - This is bizarre. I know it’s not my connection cause disco loads. I tried SC app and site, it just doesn’t seem to be updating the feed. Even WEIRDER is if I go to your profile directly, I don’t see the track at all. Say whaaaaaaaa <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_monocle.png?v=5" title=":face_with_monocle:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_monocle:"></p>

            <p>Btw, quick question to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> or anyone who follows me on SC…</p>
<p>I had this track on SC but private for a while, but put it public today. (Shortly before I posted this thread.)</p>
<p>I’ve no idea if it comes up in your stream as a new post/release from me – or whether it appears back at the original timestamp.</p>
<p>Could someone who follows me confirm if it appeared in your feed and, if so, when?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>I’ll take it as a huge compliment that the track brings those to mind.<br>
(Aphex, Squarepusher and BoC are the closest thing a heathen like me has to a Holy Trinity. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>…but you can mostly blame/thank Lorn. Can’t believe I only stumbled on him recently.<br>
Filthy sounds. Inspiring AF sound design.</p>
<p>Still trying to fuse various interests and influences – and distill my voice (or voices).</p>
<p>I’m also thinking about video as well now. (Thinking YT might be a more fruitful platform for discovery and reach.)</p>

            <p>Awesome, first off, these sounds are being beaten INTO SUBMISSION. They aren’t recognizable which is awesome. I’m getting feelings of Royksopp, a little slower paced Aphex Twin/Squarepusher, Boards of Canada etc. It’s great.</p>
<p>VERY much dig this sound. I have no complaints about the overall mix or structure <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Woah woah…I’m really digging the part that starts at 4:16! I feel like its from some retro game! Also around 5:01 that coin (I think) loop is awesome!<br>
P.S. What did you use for the bass in the song?</p>
