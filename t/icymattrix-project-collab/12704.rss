    <title>IcyMattrix [Project, Collab?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/icymattrix-project-collab/12704</link>
    <description>Hey all.  I have this project that I have been playing around with for a while.  I think I have an idea of how I would like the chorus to go and I have bits and pieces of other parts, but I’ve been busy working on some other projects at the moment and I have gotten a bit stuck.  Looking for someone to collaborate with me on this track potentially.  Give it a listen and let me know who would be interested.
