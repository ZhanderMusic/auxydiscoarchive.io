    <title>What&#39;s New in Auxy 6.5</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/whats-new-in-auxy-6-5/20873</link>
    <description>We are excited to release a new version today! ü•≥

With **Auxy 6.5** you can:
- Turn any sample into a melody with the melodic sampler (create a new instrument, choose &quot;drums and samples&quot; and look for &quot;melodic sampler&quot; at the very bottom of the list)
- Save sounds and kits as templates that you can recall quickly in any project
- Search for sounds in the reorganized browser
- Adjust the master gain for projects in the project settings
- Fine tune any instrument (tap the ‚è£ icon in the tweak panel)
- Add up to 24 instrument in each project
- Get inspiration quickly with 18 new drum kits

Also in this version:
- Resolved an issue that would cause audio glitches on certain device models
- Fixed a number of smaller bugs
- Added protection and logging to resolve a rare glitch that can corrupt the imported samples list (let us know if you have any issues and we will help you resolve it)

Looking forward to hear your thoughts and answer any questions below!</description>

            <p>Yeah the workflow value it would add is probably too low. There are probably other features more beneficial for them to be addressing.</p>
<p>That said, having super simple trimming brackets when loading samples doesn‚Äôt seem that advanced. I know several mobile DAWs that have them, some of which have way less depth, and some even free.</p>
<p>All they would have to add is a sliding ‚Äústart‚Äù bracket onto the ‚Äúlength‚Äù dial. They already had a somewhat similar setup in an earlier iteration before visual automation scenes (I think maybe V. 2.0 &amp; 3.0) where you would set a beginning position and an end position of a parameter on the dial, and the effect would change from start to end point for however long that clip was. This kind of 2 way slider on a parameter is pretty basic, and something they already have programmed in the past.</p>
<p>But whatever‚Ä¶Like I said: Not a huge deal. You‚Äôre obviously right that there are plenty of other apps for prepping samples.</p>

</aside>
<p>That‚Äôs starting to get quite hardcore for a mobile (mini-)DAW. There are a number of very capable iOS-based options for prepping samples.<br>
Can‚Äôt see that one getting much dev attention as there are sure to be many, many native not-yet-features that make more sense for an Auxy workflow.</p>

            <p>Right, but I think the length knob Only shortens the End of the sample clip‚Ä¶so when the it is reversed you are left with the long fade out, or reverb tail of the clip.</p>
<p>it‚Äôs obviously not a huge deal, but it would be nice to be able to adjust the start and end of a clip.</p>

            <p>I checked this and Stress used to have a Tone macro that was assigned to distortion mix, as well as a shape macro assigned to release. These were both removed when we updated to new macros, and replaced with dist and the actual release control. So there were no shape and tone macros in previous versions, i.e. since after the old sounds got an update button.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, Stress did previously have these macros which has been confirmed by my also having double checked on a second device which is running a version of Auxy one or two versions prior to the current one. The macro knob (Tone in the case of Stress) has disappeared from both the instrument panel and automation options, and the sound shaping capabilities of said macro are not present in any of the other macros such as distortion.</p>
<p>As far as other sounds that have or haven‚Äôt changed, I haven‚Äôt done a thorough comparison of soundpacks beyond the first few listed, as the the symptom presented itself in a session that wasn‚Äôt necessarily intended to be geared toward ‚Äúbug hunting‚Äù per se. Stress just happened to spontaneously come up early in the soundpack list, but I can only assume that there‚Äôs a reasonable possibility if other sounds being affected in an identical or similar manner.</p>

<p>Seems like a bug in that case. Will investigate asap.</p>

<p>Was looking through the new instrument categories and was confused as to why some instruments like Stress that previously had shape or tone control no longer have these in any form? As far as I can tell it prevents any means of replicating the sound previously achievable with these macros. Is this an intended feature?</p>

<p>ALSO, I really want to make custom kits a thing. When you‚Äôve made a kit you can save it for later. It would be so that you don‚Äôt need to dig up the drums every single time, and would save much time.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I just think it would be really cool if you could directly record vocals over your beats. That‚Äôs the one thing that would make it the perfect music app for me.</p>

            <p>I definitely think this new update will go a long way, since it used to be annoying to import the same sample like ten times and pitch bend each one the way you wanted. Now, I think, we‚Äôll be able to use it like an instrument which is great! Looking forward to trying some stuff out.</p>

            <p>A lot of folks do use GarageBand and record there, it‚Äôs free and works pretty well. Alternatively, you could export stems from Auxy into something like GarageBand for further mixing and overlaying of vocals and other instruments.</p>

            <p>It would be so cool if the next update allowed you to record your own vocals. I think coupled with the melodic sampler that would be pretty amazing.</p>
