    <title>Future bass with game waves only challenge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/future-bass-with-game-waves-only-challenge/14009</link>
    <description>I was making future bass and tried joystick with wubs and it sounded actually nice. So I thought this would be a nice challenge.

Good luckðŸ˜€!</description>
