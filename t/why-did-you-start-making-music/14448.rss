    <description>I’ve been in a crisis lately, I’ve found it hard for myself to discuss topics like this but I just had to ask really. What motivates you to make combinations of sounds to impress those around you? Or what motivates you to make it for yourself?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I started making my own music after I learned to use GarageBand when I remade a bunch of Eiffel 65 songs. My first song was an idea I’d been thinking about a lot. I wrote it, recorded it, and released it. That was over three years ago. Since then, I’ve been making songs as they formulate.</p>

            <p>I never really intended to make music in the first place, i found Auxy and tried it out a little and ended up making a song that was actually not that bad, so i kept going from there and ended up to now making 30+ songs that im really proud of.</p>

            <p>After reading this, I completely agree. I find that whenever I mess around with something such as distortion on any instrument, it all sounds pretty much the same. The automation screen you were talking about has been bothering me so much!  I use a lot of automation and now I feel like I’m stuck.</p>

    Honestly, I’ve talked about A6 within the Auxy Collective Discord and through Disco for far too many times, it’s a real chore that I have to keep venting my frustrations with it. 
First of all, the update would’ve been great if my old projects weren’t completely F()()()ed by the new sounds. Little did I know, the new sounds don’t sound nearly the same as they used to back in Auxy 5. 
I’ve talked to other people within The Auxy Collective discord about my situation and they had the same problems …

<p>It’s a lengthy read, but how else can I condence something so large like this update?</p>

            <p>Yeah I find myself having the same problems. The sound design was just more accessible before Auxy 6. I haven’t used Auxy since the update. I’ve been regretting updating Auxy.</p>

            <p>Yeah it sure is difficult but maybe we’ll some how adjust too it. If not I think it’s smart for them to have 2 versions of Auxy or just one that was like the last update</p>

            <p>I started making music because the programs I’ve used were accessible, which is still unfortunately true to this day. Recently, ever since the update, I’ve been quickly losing intrest in making music because there were <em>too many</em> changes happening at the same time, I was eventually lost and couldn’t make music without screwing up new and old projects.</p>

            <p>When I was younger I had this thought: "<em>what if the melodies in my head could be turned into actual songs…"</em><br>
I had already been using GarageBand since ever since I had been able to tap buttons, but I didn’t feel like I was really making music. (This was because I only used loops provided by GarageBand) Then one day (like last summer) I found Auxy.<br>
I think like a lot of people on Auxy, music is an outlet to express all the frustrating feelings you have inside. I want someone to listen to my music and feel understood…If that makes any sense.</p>

            <p>You’re right. There’s variety in music too. It doesn’t have to be so rigid, strict. It’s cool to change it up in the second verse. An extra snare will add a nice touch. A few FX here and there don’t have a pattern of frequencies, but they sound good nonetheless, if done correctly.</p>

            <p>That’s right. Done correctly math is always accurate, and music is made up of math and numbers. Half steps whole steps. Time signature. Repeating patterns. Every sound has its own set of frequencies.</p>

            <p>the reason why i started the expedition is basically to have fun and have a new experience on some of the new music being produced today.</p>
<p>this community is inevitable and it’s awesome to hear new flavors and varieties.</p>
<p>holy</p>

            <p>I’ve been involved in music since 4th grade, and even before that i was a pretty musical kid.</p>
<p>I guess after a few years I thought I’d try my hand at a new kind. Strangely enough, that’s around the time Auxy 1.0 was released <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=6" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>
<p>I was enthralled, and starting using it right away. That being said, I wasn’t particularly good with music, but I had my fun nonetheless!</p>
<p>Now I make music to make others feel just that but happier, and that’s probably why all my songs are upbeat haha</p>
<p>No matter the reason, you should try to have fun with your music ^^</p>
