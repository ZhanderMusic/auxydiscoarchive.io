    <title>Turning Mono sounds into Stereo [With Instructions]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/turning-mono-sounds-into-stereo-with-instructions/1806</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed for some time that some sounds in Auxy are stuck in Mono. With modulation, we now have some sounds that sound better in stereo without using a lot of reverb to replecate a large room.

_Example 1, Basic Melody [Igloo]_
https://app.auxy.co/projects/5SOWai1nn5sH4l2pfAXa6w==

_Example 2, Arpeggios [Tiger]_
https://app.auxy.co/projects/IT_TQiTVHAKZ5CsTkyByeg==

___

_For those viewing this without an iOS device or want to know how to convert mono sounds into stereo_

1] To create a stereo sound, find a sound that is normally in Mono, _ie, sounds from The Future, RAC Essentials_

2] Create a loop and duplicate the sound so that there is 2 of the same sounds. _The sound you just duplicated would need to be **exactly** the same as your original in order to create the stereo effect._

3] For both sounds, pan them so that one is all the way to the left and one all the way to the right.</description>

            <p>It’s pretty obvious that you’ll need to pan duplicates opposite to each other.</p>
