    <title>A Guide To Setting Levels In Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-guide-to-setting-levels-in-auxy/2909</link>
    <description>**EDITED**

I&#39;ve pulled this post. (see @Auxy&#39;s post below)

My initial goal was &#39;simple Auxy tips for a better mix&#39;, but what I actually wrote was &#39;how I record Auxy in my DAW at -6dB&#39;. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

It was probably useful to some, but more likely confusing to many.

I&#39;ll regroup and have another try tomorrow.</description>

            <p>This is a fantastic initiative! Unfortunately your tips doesn’t make sense in the Auxy context. Just commented on this in your other thread:</p>

    Great initiative! 
To clarify though, Auxy is designed to have a pretty maxed out mix with little headroom, since that’s how modern tracks usually sound. We’ve spent quite a lot of time with Grammy-winning mix engineer Niklas Flyckt, who currently mixes all of Galantis’ tracks to name one example, working out settings that will make tracks sound like finished tracks in the typical genres you would create with Auxy. 
We appreciate that there are styles and occasions that call for more headroom, a…

<p>The short explanation is that if you download your favorite tracks from genres that are typically created with Auxy, they will have equally limited headroom. The reason is that we want Auxy tracks to sound as good as “real” tracks, and if we would keep levels low, people would refer to Auxy tracks as less good sounding.</p>

            <p>Cool tip. 12 o’clock makes sense.  I think you should also do one regarding how many times, mixing problems are in fact arrangement problems.  I’ve only recently become conscious of this, and would love to see how others make sure parts aren’t competing with each other unless it’s an intentional layering situation.</p>
