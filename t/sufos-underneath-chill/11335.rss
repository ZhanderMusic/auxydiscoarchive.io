    <description>Hey people! I finally got around to finish one of my tracks that i had sitting in my projects, and it turned out great. Its kinda Chill/Future Bass-y. Also, remember to stay around for the 2nd drop, its a pixel explosion! Okay, enough talking. Here you go!

(I have a couple more tracks coming out soon, including some deeper, heavier tracks, and my best track to date. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰)

I am so close to hitting 4K listens on Soundcloud. My listens are going very slowly up, so i would love to hit 4K today! Whoâ€™s gonna get my 4000th listen?

Here is my music: https://soundcloud.com/sofus-agervig-351033928

            <p>Hey, I enjoyed the track!<br>
Feedback!<br>
-I like the second drop! It adds good spice to repetitive melody line.<br>
-I also love the ending automation!<br>
-the code progression sounds a bit too usual? I think you can change the length of each sound.</p>
