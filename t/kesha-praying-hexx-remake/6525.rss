            <p>This was me ten years ago+, I TOTALLY FEEL YOU. It makes it very difficult haha. Now my problem is I’d either have to do it in public or with my wife and kids around lolol, so things don’t necessarily get any easier</p>

            <p>I like it. I kind of feel like you’re holding back with your voice? I’m no singer, I’ve done my fair share of songs with vocals though and I kind of felt like maybe you were singing and didn’t want to be loud? Been there. I like your take on the Mariah Carey-esque super high pitched part.</p>
<p>The pitch glide square wave is a little wonky. It’s not bad it just comes out of nowhere and maybe it’s a little loud?</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this though I like the tonality of your voice. I think the vocal mixing could use a little massaging (the second half of the songs vocals sounded louder) but it’s not something unsalvageable.</p>
<p>Keeping an ear out for your other vocal stuff I really did like this, just wanted to offer some feedback!</p>
