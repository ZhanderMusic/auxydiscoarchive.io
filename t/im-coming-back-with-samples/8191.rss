    <description>Hello guys, im back

I haven&#39;t used this app for a very long time, mostly because I have a laptop now. Since I found out about samples in Auxy a week ago, I&#39;d like to give back with a lot of bass patches and drums that I&#39;ve made. 

I can&#39;t really update Auxy unless I delete it and use a different account so I don&#39;t know if you can change the pitch of the sample and if you can stretch the sample into a desired bpm rate, so I&#39;ll stick to 160BPM and Gm key unless I find out more.

I&#39;ll be back with wav samples of many of the basses like in here:
