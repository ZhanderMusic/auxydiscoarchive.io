    <title>Skyborne - Nite Lite [Collab? Project, Melodic Dubstep]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/skyborne-nite-lite-collab-project-melodic-dubstep/7356</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t put much work into this one yet but I&#39;m really interested in finishing it with someone else&#39;s ideas thrown into the mix! See what you can do and send it back to me and I might put finishing touches on it and post it to my SoundCloud! Of course you will get credits and of course I will ask before I post anything you have helped to create! Thank you!

            <p>Mine are general right now and I haven’t spaced them out properly, but just use a bass that isn’t super heavy, make it either second or third lowest octave, and then use lowpass constantly jumping down to about middle and rise up to full in one measure</p>
