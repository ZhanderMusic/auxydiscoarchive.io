    <title>Auxy Forum - Track of the Week #38 [Winner Announced!]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-38-winner-announced/19690</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @MrSerpent 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961). 

**PLEASE NOTE: If you change your title in profile settings from ‚Äúblank‚Äù to Regular, or vice versa, YOU WILL LOSE ALL CD‚ÄôS AND UNICORNS!**

            <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>My sincerest apologies issued to those participating last week for my poor punctuality, but I have listened through the entries and selected a winner for TOTW <span class="hashtag">#38</span>.</p>
<p>The intricacies of Tushensu‚Äôs song US totally blew me away! It takes the cake as totw 38‚Äôs winning submission. Nice going to all who took part; I thoroughly enjoyed every song submitted thanks to you guys. Keep at it!</p>
<p>Congrats to Tushensu for the winning submission, highly recommend you take a peek at his song+give him a follow if you haven‚Äôt already <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
