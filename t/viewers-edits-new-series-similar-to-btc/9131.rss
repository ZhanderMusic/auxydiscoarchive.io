    <title>&#39;Viewers Edits&#39; - New series similar to BTC</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/viewers-edits-new-series-similar-to-btc/9131</link>
    <description>Hey guys I’ve started a new series called viewers edits. It is basically BTC but a little different. Here is how it works: 
https://youtu.be/RfnK6hlUThE
 Each week on a Monday I will create a project for you to download. You will be given roughy a week to come up with a song of any length, style, genre etc. 

Title the project “Viewers edits #(week number) (your name)”

And for soundcloud title it “DJLR - Viewers Edits #(week number) your name)

Then you can post it on soundcloud and post it here. Make sure to leave a comment on the video of the project you made, and I will check them all out. I will then pick top 3 winners of that week. Winners get a feature in a video, shoutout and reposted on Soundcloud.

Project for week 1: https://app.auxy.co/projects/EfcFu6XTPWwFRSjiWoF9XA==</description>

            <p>Lol I was watching the vid on YouTube before, I was hoping you posted it to the disco.</p>
<p>Also, I want to tell you that I do not have SoundCloud, so is it ok if I can dm you with the project, and post the link on the video, as well? (Project link)</p>
