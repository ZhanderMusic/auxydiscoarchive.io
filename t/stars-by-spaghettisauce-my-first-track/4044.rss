    <title>Stars By SpaghettiSauce [My first track]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/stars-by-spaghettisauce-my-first-track/4044</link>
    <description>I recently saw some people posting their first song that they made on Auxy. I decided that I should try to do the same. My first song turned out to be a really nice sounding loop, which I added on to and created a full fledged song. The song is called &quot;stars&quot;. Hope you like it!

            <p>That might have actually been a good idea, but no, it’s stars. I will change that to avoid confusion.</p>

            <p>Is it stars or starts as you said in thread title?<br>
Maybe it’s written like that intentionally cuz it’s your start of your music career?</p>
