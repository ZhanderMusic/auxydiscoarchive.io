            <p>Thanks man I really appreciate it! And also thanks for the feedback, I want to be able to learn and improve as much as I can to get the best possible sound. I completely see where your coming from the gossip with that many notes gives it a little crackle. I’ll be mindful of that next time!</p>

            <p>For being your first release, other than your beat the clock 22 entry, this is solid! You arranged it pretty well and chose good sounds that fit the tone of the track. My only thoughts would maybe be to try to lower the bass an octave sometimes (might make it sound cooler at times), and also, when you use the sound “gossip,” do your best to not have multiple notes from gossip running at the same time, since it creates a really gritty sound that is typically undesirable (unless you want it that way). Hope that helps! Its a really good first track though.</p>
