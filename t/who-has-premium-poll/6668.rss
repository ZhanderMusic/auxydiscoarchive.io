            <p>I’m with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a>. I’m paying for this but my parents say they would be more than happy to buy it for me if I was unable to. Creating things for auxy is becoming the core of my free time, and anyway, if we didn’t pay money for sounds, the auxy team wouldn’t be able to pay people to make the packs themselves.</p>

            <p>It’s real simple. This is the last thing I’m saying about the subject:</p>
<p>5 bucks a month is literally the cost of two 711 coffees, or one Starbucks coffee. If my kids were into this I’d be MORE THAN HAPPY to front the money. How many of you have xbox or PlayStation subscriptions? I’d rather my son say “Dad I really would like this subscription for creating something” rather than sitting around playing video games.</p>
<p>If your parents won’t front the money for you, shame on them, if times are tough for real then that’s a different story and I feel for you guys, that stinks.</p>
<p>I feel like most of the complaining is because the climate of pricing on the AppStore sucks, everyone thinks everything should just be free and it’s really ridiculous.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other apps that are pay once. There are plenty of other apps that are great too. I guess I’m kind of chuffed about this because I see the same bullsh!t over at TouchArcade and it’s just so tiring.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever. Prioritize your monthly subscriptions, talk to your parents about it. If my kids wanted to CREATE rather than CONSUME I’d be overjoyed.</p>
