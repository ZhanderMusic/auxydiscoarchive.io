    <title>How often should I make an album?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-often-should-i-make-an-album/7474</link>
    <description>So I’m doing my first album and I thought “how often should I do this?”
I don’t think there’s a set timeline but if someone could be me a general idea that’d be great. Thanks for any replies.</description>

            <p>I think what he means is to release a few songs as singles first prior to the album, just like major labels do. To generate hype and give the vibe of the album. Otherwise it could be overwhelming for someone to jump into exploring a sound that would be 100% new to them.</p>

            <p>Although the phrase “quality over quantity” sounds right, I actually think it might depend on where you think you are in terms of your musical potential. For example if a guy was just starting producing and spent forever making a song he thought was “perfect”, he’s probably going to improve very rapidly and the song will sound like trash in a few months. It might be time better spent to not get too into the nitty-gritty and keep moving on. I don’t know where you think your at it terms of your skill potential, and there is definitely a place for quality over quantity, but this is just something to consider.</p>

            <p>Yea I’m not doing that. I’ve been working on a song with vocals for about a a week or 2  now. When it comes out might I tag you for feedback?<br>
Right now I need to work on the bridge between what I like and what others like.<br>
And feedback is crucial. Especially from experienced composers.</p>

            <p>The focus should be on quality, not quantity.</p>

            <p>So I’m doing my first album and I thought “how often should I do this?”<br>
I don’t think there’s a set timeline but if someone could be me a general idea that’d be great. Thanks for any replies.</p>
