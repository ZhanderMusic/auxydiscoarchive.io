    <title>Dense - E/E (James Lucien) [House]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dense-e-e-james-lucien-house/5852</link>
    <description>https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/dense-auxy-mix

This is the other remaining track as E/E that has currently been posted. This is an Auxy remix of the original song, which was done painstakingly in pure Garageband. This mix is a hybrid blend to get the strings in there as well. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s certainly kicking especially as my second ever real House track.

[(Here is the original mix, if you&#39;re so inclined. It isn&#39;t as good as the Auxy mix, had a lot of issues and such)](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/dense)

            <p>Ahhh the strings are so nice. Really nice house track. Maybe make the kicks slight ly more audible because everything is loud and without headphones I cant really hear them. That’s just a minor hung though because you can still sense where they are as a whole. Love this song though. Very well done.</p>
