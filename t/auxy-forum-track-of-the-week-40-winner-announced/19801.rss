    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-40-winner-announced/19801</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* zhandermusic
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @zhandermusic 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961). 

**PLEASE NOTE: If you change your title in profile settings from ‚Äúblank‚Äù to Regular, or vice versa, YOU WILL LOSE ALL CDS AND UNICORNS!**

            <p>Well, very interesting tracks, and all were good! Thank you for submitting!<br>
But, the one that really stood out was <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/assasinerd">@Assasinerd</a> ! Congratulations, you‚Äôve won week 40! Your basslines at the end were absolutely unbelievable, literally i had to ask for the project because it didn‚Äôt sound like an auxy track. So congratulations! To others, just because you didn‚Äôt win this week, doesn‚Äôt mean you cant win others! Keep trying, keep your head up, and never give up!<br>
