    <title>Rubbing Glass by Tyballs [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/rubbing-glass-by-tyballs-wip/8360</link>
    <description>Quite new to Auxy. Quite new to making music. This is my first post and I really would like to get your opinion of my first released track. Should I extend it? Is it thin?

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dj_peloton">@Dj_Peloton</a>. I will post more of my tracks later and I kind of liked it when you said it was odd and wonky. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>This is a great first song! My only problem is the bass line/chord progression, IMO is quite odd and wonky, but other than that, bravo! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/clap.png?v=5" title=":clap:" class="emoji" alt=":clap:"></p>
