    <title>Weird background in a drum kit sample</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/weird-background-in-a-drum-kit-sample/17581</link>
    <description>Hello
I was working on a track and came across some unusual background noises from the sample impact titled “Need For Speed” from LEVIATHAN 2’s sample pack.

It sounds like some kind of tape recorder or something like that. 
Does anyone know what it is?</description>
