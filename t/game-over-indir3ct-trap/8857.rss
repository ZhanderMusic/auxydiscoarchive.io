    <title>Game Over - INDIR3CT (Trap)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/game-over-indir3ct-trap/8857</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! So I&#39;m working on a Trap track, and I&#39;m hoping to submit it to a record label such as Hybrid Trap Official, Drop central, Kaliedo collective, or Lowly palace. I got in contact with each one, and I got the information on how to submit my demo. 

I have the track I wanted to submit somewhat done, But I need feedback! I uploaded it as a private soundcloud link because of the .wav sample in it. 

Please take a listen and let me know where I can improve or what I can do to change!

Thanks so much!!!!!

            <p>I like this one m8, I like the ‘deep’ feeling it gives off. Thanks to the new orchestral stuff <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
