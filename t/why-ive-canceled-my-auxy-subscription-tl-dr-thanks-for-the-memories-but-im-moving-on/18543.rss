    <title>Why I&#39;ve Canceled My Auxy Subscription (Tl;dr: Thanks for the memories but I&#39;m moving on)</title>

    <description>Hello, and welcome to this post which was a long time coming for me. I want to say first and foremost thank you to both @Auxy and @Fredrik for creating such an inspiring app that has helped me not only find my passion but create a way for me to express that online. If it were not for the original Beat the Clock challenges, more specifically the 8th one, I would not have even created a SoundCloud account and started posting my music online. I&#39;d still be just writing orchestral sounds, and who knows where my life would have even headed without the friends I&#39;ve made here and online along the way. It comes with my great displeasure to see myself distancing from the app which has brought so much joy into my life, but with the direction it has been heading I can no longer in good conscious support it with a (yearly) subscription. The fact that I must even specify this is part of the issue for me.

I won&#39;t be discussing my absence from the Disco on here, mostly it was due to burnout and a lot of bad blood with some people which according to friends has rectified itself in the months I was away. But this is an important point to bring up, because it also plays into the fact that I&#39;m moving away from Auxy as a whole in the future.

The truth of the matter is that Auxy as an application is stagnating. It has been stagnating ever since the subscription was implemented. From the first pack ever to be subscription-based being free samples from DSK Sounds, hidden soundpacks in the source files that were disabled until much later when they could of been introduced along with Auxy 5, using Serum factory-preset wavetables in Auxy instruments on multiple occasions to completely breaking the way automation locks in the grid and in the settings with Auxy 6, Auxy has become an experience more frustrating than rewarding. And the worst part of it is, when I&#39;m finalizing the thirty-some odd songs that I still need to release, if there&#39;s one single error I need to go and correct, I will need to shell out additional money just to change a preset in order to even access what I myself worked on. No grace, no understanding unlike with previous versions, hard paywall lock. 

The subscription itself is not the issue here, it&#39;s the attitude the developers have taken into ensuring that the app is stable enough to continue going with the minimal drip-feed approach effort into monthly (and sometimes not even monthly) sound pack releases, uninspiring pack demos, and stale sounds that nobody wanted. 

The one thing, however, that really nailed it in the coffin for me, was when my phone crashed and had to be restored, and I lost all my recent projects. Granted, I hadn&#39;t been working on many new projects since Auxy 5.4 removed the cloud sync, but it was a wake-up call for me that I needed to move away from the program. I have been told that this was an Apple issue and not an Auxy issue, but it was a huge step backwards for me and the way I used the app that I couldn&#39;t support anymore.

And finally, we come to the disaster for my workflow that Auxy 6 was. At this point I was so disappointed and frustrated trying to create songs that I gave up on multiple occasions, which certainly didn&#39;t help my burnout from working myself to tears on multiple nights on songs. Frustration doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the backwards decisions to not make automation snap like it used to. No longer can you easily snap automation to the last scene&#39;s setting, meaning the slightest sub-pixel change will throw off your parameter setting when trying to adjust something not set at either 0 or 100 on the grid. Auxy 6 fundamentally ruined how sounds worked as well, blasting away the complicated Reverb controls and limiting the numerous parameters even available. It&#39;s strange how no recent soundpacks even offer phaser or other tone controls unlike the previous ones. Not to mention how frustrating it is to adjust attack, release and portamento ms sliders without exact controls. And the fact that updating sounds often cleared my settings on multiple occasions didn&#39;t help either. And adding portamento to many presets where it initially didn&#39;t belong. Or not allowing it to be automated. Or not allowing attack and release to be automated anymore fundamentally changing how most pads worked and excelled with clever automation. Or the fact that you broke Crater and it doesn&#39;t actually give you any reverb but still does what it used to do, making its menu for reverb useless. Or how delay is fundamentally changed and sounds awful compared to how it used to. Or how if you didn&#39;t update you couldn&#39;t change the interval on delay anymore. Or how the default drum reverb is way too huge compared to what it used to be and can&#39;t even be configured to sound the same way, or how compression isn&#39;t even adjustable and sounds extra clicky. Or how every sound is so loud that the poor limiter on the master track is entirely overworked the whole time leading to a muddy messy mix on most tracks without careful frustrating tuning. Or how you can only automate the mix parameter on the new settings making even more sounds fundamentally change and sound bland and stale compared to how they used to. Or taking away the default demo sounds and making the app otherwise worthless to anyone who doesn&#39;t shell out cash, making it an even harder sell to new users who might want to really really get into it but are intimidated by a lackluster 1-week trial and mediocre uninspiring demos and presets that really don&#39;t do the app&#39;s various added sounds any justice, not even covering the best packs that have been released in the subscription but going off of lackluster presets from a year and a half ago.

Sure that may seem a little ranty, but it&#39;s the truth. Auxy is no longer the same experience that it once was, and complacency has only made the app more uninspiring to use than ever, on top of all the frustration.

So... where does that leave me? Well, I&#39;m still around, and [I finally released a track just yesterday](https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/pending) and have an EP coming out in May. I am determined to get the last of my work with the app out online as much as I can before I move onto a desktop DAW that respects my money and offers me the features I need to create the sound I want and need to now. I will miss Auxy, but I plan to stick around on the Auxy Community discord, and maybe the occasional post here[spoiler] if I don&#39;t get Akabill&#39;d for this huge rant of a post.[/spoiler]

I really want to see Auxy change, and with the way it&#39;s heading, I only see it stagnating and eventually disappearing off the map as larger companies bring better offerings to mobile, which has already been happening as of late. It pains me to see such a large part of the last 5 years of my life (I was around when Auxy Classic was up and even beta tested the original red auxy app. I was one of the people who convinced Lenberg to use Eb, Ab and Bb instead of D# G# and A# on the scale selector even) drifting away from me, but it&#39;s time to move on. 

[details=Well... until next time everyone...]

            <p>Was there a need to change the base preset for delay then? I’d argue no. But if people prefer it that way I suppose I’m wrong. It would be nice to be able to still use delay without updating a sound, but alas you can’t change the interval anymore effectively hard-lining you into updating it.</p>

            <p>Before you update every instrument of old project files, there is a warning that the sliders will be reset. If you would like to argue that opening a new instrument and tweaking the effect’s “mix” knob sounds different, that would obviously be correct, since the effect parameters are reset to “0” universally, instead of being tied to the preset of individual instruments. But that doesn’t mean you can’t tweak it back and have it sound the exact same.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t mean there hasn’t been a change to how the way delay worked before the update to how it works now. If something has to be done differently, that doesn’t involve just raising the same thing as before, that means there’s a change.</p>
<p>… It made more sense in my head. But if something for an instrument is different from before, that means there was a change, and having to go and recreate that is a hassle. Is what I’m trying to say.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think it’s more so that you don’t understand how the parameters work rather than the setting being different. As he said, it’s the exact same. The big knob is the “mix”, basically the volume of the effect. All the sliders inside tweak the effect, up to the point where you can make the settings sound the exact same as before, or even something completely different. I’m thinking that you’ve just been tweaking the knob.</p>

<p>No. As I’ve said so many times, we had very little money when we were selling sound packs, basically loosing money every month. With subscriptions, we get sustainable revenue, and that’s why we’re keeping this model. You can claim that this is not good for business if you want, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s actually the only sustainable choice for the business.</p>

            <p>I had DM conversations with AKA so don’t judge it by one thread or post. The problem boiled down to the fact that his behavior was pretty destructive at times, which he agreed about but still didn’t want to change. He thrived on upsetting other people, which is not a good thing if you’re trying to build a friendly and positive community.</p>

</aside>
<p>First you say that Auxy has “stagnated” and then you go on to complain about changes we’re making to improve the app. Makes no sense to me. If something makes you very disappointed and frustrated, please quit doing it and focus on something else. Maybe get some sleep instead of working yourself into tears every night.</p>

<p>The one thing, however, that really nailed it in the coffin for me, was when my phone crashed and had to be restored, and I lost all my recent projects. Granted, I hadn’t been working on many new projects since Auxy 5.4 removed the cloud sync, but it was a wake-up call for me that I needed to move away from the program. I have been told that this was an Apple issue and not an Auxy issue, but it was a huge step backwards for me and the way I used the app that I couldn’t support anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I mean… You’re basically saying that your phone broke down and that made you really upset with Auxy. The app is making frequent backups to iCloud, regardless of the iCloud sync support, so not sure what you’re missing in terms of backups.</p>

            <p>I have unlisted these threads because they are full of hyperbolic statements and false claims, which will be very hard to make sense of for someone who has just joined the community. It seems to me that there is a handfull of people who keep coming back to these topics and promoting the notion that Auxy does not want to improve, does not listen to feedback, has unfair pricing, etc. It also appears that the people interested in this discussion are already on this thread.</p>
<p>By reframing the same feedback over and over, you force me to come back and argue about stuff, even though I have already shared my thoughts previously. On a general level, anyone is welcome to share their thoughts on anything, but what is really frustrating is when things keep coming up because a few people cannot accept the fact that we are not going to change things based on their feedback.</p>
<p>For instance, you might not like subscriptions, but we are not going to change our model, so you can either accept it or decide that you want to use some other app that has a different model. For instance, Garageband is free so that could be a good alternative if you’re concerned about price.</p>
<p>You are welcome to share your thoughts along the lines of “sorry guys but I hate subscriptions so I’m gonna have to go with Garageband instead” but please quit arguing for years about how our decisions are not good for the business. You frankly have no idea what you are talking about with regards to the general case.</p>
<p>I am not gonna answer every opinion posted in this thread but I will add some comments below to clarify my reasoning.</p>

            <p>It appears my comments have been deemed provocative so I will try and be respectful as all of my comments are in hopes of improving auxy. This thread is very important for the auxy community to see as it would allow true and honest feedback for the better of auxy. I won’t intervene heavily as it has been seen as too harsh so all I will say is that some things should change if a healthy community is to be maintained.</p>

            <p>I might’ve worded it a bit harshly <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:">…</p>
<p>The parts about getting featured were minor  problems. The stolen aspect I eventually got used to, but the one about 140k plays still rattles me a bit. I’ve been very lucky to receive the exposure i’ve been given, and I’m very greatful, but sometimes i think other users thought there were absolutely no side effects and i wanted to show them the rest of the story. I’m open to discuss this privately if nessecary.</p>

            <p>To sum up your experience being promoted by Auxy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You miss being featured by Auxy as a way to get more exposure, which you have “greatly benefited from” in the past</li>
<li>Getting featured has been a pain in the ass because the exposure has lead to some people with no followers posting your tracks on their profiles</li>
<li>Some guy uploaded your track to Spotify and somehow got on a playlist that generated 140k plays</li>
<li>Being heavily promoted by Auxy sucks</li>
<li>Having people look up to you is annoying and you prefer to rather just be an artist and create music</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>My thoughts:<br>
It seems like the really annoying thing was that one guy stole a track, distributed it to Spotify and got lucky getting featured in a playlist. This is of course unfortunate, but I can assure you it’s not something happening to Auxy users only. There are tons of copyright disputes on every major platform every day. The best way to prevent these issues is to be the first person uploading to these platforms.</p>
<p>I think we could have done a better job clarifying that people are not allowed to steal tracks, and that is why we locked the export feature for demo tracks a while back.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems to me that the value of getting your name and tracks out to hundreds of thousands of people is still worth the occasional guy stealing the track and eventually having to take it down and not getting any money for it. If a track would really take off, or end up as the beat for some big rap hit or something, you would be able to actually process and retain the rights to that track. And this would be great given how hard it is to gain exposure as an artist today.</p>
