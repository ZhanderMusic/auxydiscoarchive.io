<p>Hello, and welcome to this post which was a long time coming for me. I want to say first and foremost thank you to both <a class="mention" href="../../u/Auxy.html">@Auxy</a> and <a class="mention" href="index.htmlu/fredrik">@Fredrik</a> for creating such an inspiring app that has helped me not only find my passion but create a way for me to express that online. If it were not for the original Beat the Clock challenges, more specifically the 8th one, I would not have even created a SoundCloud account and started posting my music online. I’d still be just writing orchestral sounds, and who knows where my life would have even headed without the friends I’ve made here and online along the way. It comes with my great displeasure to see myself distancing from the app which has brought so much joy into my life, but with the direction it has been heading I can no longer in good conscious support it with a (yearly) subscription. The fact that I must even specify this is part of the issue for me.</p>
<p>I won’t be discussing my absence from the Disco on here, mostly it was due to burnout and a lot of bad blood with some people which according to friends has rectified itself in the months I was away. But this is an important point to bring up, because it also plays into the fact that I’m moving away from Auxy as a whole in the future.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that Auxy as an application is stagnating. It has been stagnating ever since the subscription was implemented. From the first pack ever to be subscription-based being free samples from DSK Sounds, hidden soundpacks in the source files that were disabled until much later when they could of been introduced along with Auxy 5, using Serum factory-preset wavetables in Auxy instruments on multiple occasions to completely breaking the way automation locks in the grid and in the settings with Auxy 6, Auxy has become an experience more frustrating than rewarding. And the worst part of it is, when I’m finalizing the thirty-some odd songs that I still need to release, if there’s one single error I need to go and correct, I will need to shell out additional money just to change a preset in order to even access what I myself worked on. No grace, no understanding unlike with previous versions, hard paywall lock.</p>
<p>The subscription itself is not the issue here, it’s the attitude the developers have taken into ensuring that the app is stable enough to continue going with the minimal drip-feed approach effort into monthly (and sometimes not even monthly) sound pack releases, uninspiring pack demos, and stale sounds that nobody wanted.</p>
<p>The one thing, however, that really nailed it in the coffin for me, was when my phone crashed and had to be restored, and I lost all my recent projects. Granted, I hadn’t been working on many new projects since Auxy 5.4 removed the cloud sync, but it was a wake-up call for me that I needed to move away from the program. I have been told that this was an Apple issue and not an Auxy issue, but it was a huge step backwards for me and the way I used the app that I couldn’t support anymore.</p>
<p>And finally, we come to the disaster for my workflow that Auxy 6 was. At this point I was so disappointed and frustrated trying to create songs that I gave up on multiple occasions, which certainly didn’t help my burnout from working myself to tears on multiple nights on songs. Frustration doesn’t even begin to describe the backwards decisions to not make automation snap like it used to. No longer can you easily snap automation to the last scene’s setting, meaning the slightest sub-pixel change will throw off your parameter setting when trying to adjust something not set at either 0 or 100 on the grid. Auxy 6 fundamentally ruined how sounds worked as well, blasting away the complicated Reverb controls and limiting the numerous parameters even available. It’s strange how no recent soundpacks even offer phaser or other tone controls unlike the previous ones. Not to mention how frustrating it is to adjust attack, release and portamento ms sliders without exact controls. And the fact that updating sounds often cleared my settings on multiple occasions didn’t help either. And adding portamento to many presets where it initially didn’t belong. Or not allowing it to be automated. Or not allowing attack and release to be automated anymore fundamentally changing how most pads worked and excelled with clever automation. Or the fact that you broke Crater and it doesn’t actually give you any reverb but still does what it used to do, making its menu for reverb useless. Or how delay is fundamentally changed and sounds awful compared to how it used to. Or how if you didn’t update you couldn’t change the interval on delay anymore. Or how the default drum reverb is way too huge compared to what it used to be and can’t even be configured to sound the same way, or how compression isn’t even adjustable and sounds extra clicky. Or how every sound is so loud that the poor limiter on the master track is entirely overworked the whole time leading to a muddy messy mix on most tracks without careful frustrating tuning. Or how you can only automate the mix parameter on the new settings making even more sounds fundamentally change and sound bland and stale compared to how they used to. Or taking away the default demo sounds and making the app otherwise worthless to anyone who doesn’t shell out cash, making it an even harder sell to new users who might want to really really get into it but are intimidated by a lackluster 1-week trial and mediocre uninspiring demos and presets that really don’t do the app’s various added sounds any justice, not even covering the best packs that have been released in the subscription but going off of lackluster presets from a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Sure that may seem a little ranty, but it’s the truth. Auxy is no longer the same experience that it once was, and complacency has only made the app more uninspiring to use than ever, on top of all the frustration.</p>
<p>So… where does that leave me? Well, I’m still around, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/pending">I finally released a track just yesterday</a> and have an EP coming out in May. I am determined to get the last of my work with the app out online as much as I can before I move onto a desktop DAW that respects my money and offers me the features I need to create the sound I want and need to now. I will miss Auxy, but I plan to stick around on the Auxy Community discord, and maybe the occasional post here<span class="spoiler"> if I don’t get Akabill’d for this huge rant of a post.</span></p>
<p>I really want to see Auxy change, and with the way it’s heading, I only see it stagnating and eventually disappearing off the map as larger companies bring better offerings to mobile, which has already been happening as of late. It pains me to see such a large part of the last 5 years of my life (I was around when Auxy Classic was up and even beta tested the original red auxy app. I was one of the people who convinced Lenberg to use Eb, Ab and Bb instead of D# G# and A# on the scale selector even) drifting away from me, but it’s time to move on.</p>

<p>Sadly, I must agree with you, especially these points. In the early months of the subscription, I defended it and the developers, but now I am very weary of it. I feel that feedback is often disregarded with some sort of snarky remark, but when somebody points this out, the devs claim they are very open to feedback. I don’t know about that. The sounds have been consistently samey despite all the feedback we’ve been posting on the forum looking to move away from that style.</p>
<p>I once thought about closing Auxy for a few months and then come back to get inspired and excited by everything they added while I was gone. But I’m kind of glad I didn’t do it. I hate to say it, but I would have been disappointed. I remember the excitement I used to get with every pack. I wanted to get it as fast as possible, test the sounds, demo them, praise them.</p>
<p>Last time I saw there was a new soundpack I didn’t even look at it for a few hours, I didn’t feel any desire to rush to check it out. I loved Auxy, and I hate to lambaste it so, but it’s important to be honest about the future of the app.</p>
<p>Whenever there are such points made, people tend to say the devs are busy, or some similar statement. But it seems more and more people who used to say this are finally starting to speak their mind, and I think there’s a reason why.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support. Personally for me, one of my personal disappointments were the uninspiring demo projects. They always got me excited to try and create something cool. Now… what do we get? Boring loops that don’t even make a song. It’s disheartening. There’s plenty of people who would put in the effort to add just that little bit of touch and care that Auxy desperately needs, that it used to have all that time ago. But now? It isn’t important it seems.</p>

<div class="post" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I remember that auxy was reaching its peak before they released the subscription (I have had the app since it came out). I was fascinated when I first moved from auxy jam to auxy pro; everything sounded so much better back then, even when I wasn’t as good of a producer and there weren’t as many automated parts. I also feel increasingly frustrated with the sound packs. They all have sounded the same recently. Most people find like 3 sounds in each pack they like and the rest they ignore. I don’t even use more than 1/2 of the sounds and out of the ones I do use, most of them are og. I don’t feel like auxy is a capable beat maker anymore. Everyone who used to use the app has left. Even those who defended it such as <a class="mention" href="../../u/austin_haga.html">@aUstin_Haga</a> and Akabillposters whose account I can even link because it must be gone. Everyone was talking about how (in the subscription feedback page) auxy had a cheap subscription that was worth it. Well, it may have been worth it back then but not anymore. Other producer such as <a class="mention" href="../../u/decruz.html">@decruz</a> and <a class="mention" href="../../u/tsunanz.html">@Tsunanz</a> have also either stopped using auxy or have decided to use other daws. I just use it because it’s easy to make some random projects quickly. Overall, auxy has actually given me bad habits. It’s interface is unrealistic and underwhelming compared to the vast array of music production software out there. Therefore, warming up to programs such as Cubasis and ableton is so hard for me because I don’t usually have access to so many features. If I could go back, I would have left auxy when everyone else did. Before it became a money grab. Now it’s just so hard for me to cancel my subscription. I want to, I just don’t have the closure that perhaps you guys do. Auxy doesn’t care about its users anymore. They just want money and their sound packs are not made from feedback like they used to. I can feel the end coming. I can’t stay forever. If I quit auxy premium, I don’t know what drums I’ll have, but I should maintain all the the sound packs I bought before which is most of the sounds I use anyways. Therefore, I feel that it may be useful to leave soon. When I had a thread asking where old producers I had known had gone and I was really sad, the main response was, ‘oh they got busy, people move on, that’s just life’ but nobody said the blatantly obvious thing: ‘auxy is no longer good enough, auxy is not worth it, auxy is a money grab, auxy is stagnating.’ I agree with everything as well. I am fond of both <a class="mention" href="../../u/dho.html">@DHO</a> and <a class="mention" href="../../u/therealjfalc.html">@TheRealJFalc</a>. I’m glad I share your concerns. Hopefully I will soon be able to find the strength to leave this app. It is no longer worth the money or the pain. I never thought about it, but maybe I should finalize my journey on auxy with a few more tracks and that last album will be my memoire before I move on into the real world of music. One where one payment is enough and I get enough sounds and features that were in auxy forever.</p>
<p>I know this is getting long but I want to say, when people said ‘the subscription is such a low price’ they didn’t consider how much that adds up, that was 2 years ago. Most users have now spent $120 or more if they started with the subscription back then. That’s already higher than many desktop and it’s way higher than any iOS daws. So, as a long time member of auxy, whose voice was never heard in the first place, I hope to soon join you with the departure from auxy.</p>

<p>As an addendum, I also forgot to mention the times I was losing my mind rendering a full 7+ minute project and some of the wav files were empty because apparently the system can’t handle exporting stems from projects that massive.

</aside>
<p>I think that auxy never cared. They never really cared about individuals. I provided feedback so many times, got mad at the subscription, and got mad at how they decided who would test out auxy beta. Even all of their favorite producers have become far less active. It’s a sign. When the favorites leave, the flecks of dust on the side (aka me and maybe other producers) are unimportant. Even when there is an opening for them.</p>

<p>He was rather rude giving criticism directly to lenberg back when 5.2 came out. However, it was the only thing that made him ever respond in the first place. When you burn all the bridges and leave people to trudge through the river, he was one of the people to do so and got punished for it.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s a desktop DAW with a mobile offering, I haven’t tried the mobile offering however. It recently (a year or so now) came to Mac as well so that’s also a plus.</p>
<p>Cubase is pretty good too from what I’ve heard. Most DAWs actually are, but the interfaces is where a lot of the debate comes up for what’s “good” or “bad”. In reality it’s just different.</p>
