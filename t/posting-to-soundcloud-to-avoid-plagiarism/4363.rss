            <p>I used to be paranoid about plagiarism for my artwork, but it turns out most people don’t give a doggidy damn unless you’re really big. You should enjoy your anonymity and post before you become a big time celeb (and too cool for this forum, I’m sure).</p>
<p>Even if you think your content is really good, the plagiarists use numbers (eg. Of follows, plays, ect) to determine whether content is worth stealing. The advantage of having it online is that there’s usually a date of creation, and you can call them out on whatever forum will listen.</p>

            <p>Question: Why are you making music? Is it purely for yourself or are you hoping to share it, so that others can hear it and enjoy it? Do you hope to make it a bigger thing in your life at some point?</p>

            <p>Are you sharing the music in other ways too?</p>
<p>Because, if you’re <em>only</em> posting on SC and only doing that to prevent plagiarism, then it’s only the fact that you’re posting on SC that makes plagiarism possible. People can’t plagiarise what they’ve never seen/heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Flawless logic. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Of course, posting on SC doesn’t really prevent plagiarism.<br>
In some ways it’ll discourage it because you’ve published it publicly and it’s associated with your account and a date.<br>
However, the more you share, the more people see it – and the more likely it becomes that someone will plagiarise it.</p>
<p>The good news is that plagiarism is still extremely rare in the scale of things.<br>
Unless you’ve been targeted (repeatedly), it’s not something worth getting paranoid about.</p>
<p>That said, I’d typically recommend against sharing a project file unless you’re inviting others to work on it, adapt it, whatever. No point in making it easy for anyone who might consider ripping your stuff.</p>
