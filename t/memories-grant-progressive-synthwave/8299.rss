    <description>https://soundcloud.com/mynameisgr4nt/memories Hey guys. I’m really liking Auxy so far, it’s nice that I can make high quality stuff away from my computer. This is a song I’m pretty proud about. If you want to hear more of my stuff I’d suggest checking out my bandcamp: mynameisgr4nt.bandcamp.com I have some albums there already and I’m thinking of releasing some free music on there soon. Thanks if you’re even reading this. I you have any thoughts on this song please tell me I’m all ears :slight_smile:</description>
