            <p>I appreciate the perspective on structure.  I need work in that area, as it takes effort for me to even notice it, much less build around it, while modes and such come naturally.</p>
<p>There is little better than clever key changes to mix things up.  I’ve been blown away by one in particular ever since I was an adolescent in the 80s: the bridge to the final chorus in Time by Culture Club modulates up a <em>minor third</em> in the smoothest way I’ve heard anywhere before or since.</p>
<p>Editing down is hard, and turns into a kind of OCD for me.  I’d say your track could benefit from some judicious thickening, especially in the verses, but then again if I produced songs I’d be solidly in the Trevor Horn/Phil Spector school of “more is more”, surprise surprise.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>I checked out the Gorillaz track and see what you mean. It’s an intriguing little section they start, but as you say, it’s so short-lived.</p>
<p>Your Royksopp reference is curious as there isn’t any difference for the music before the verse and the (first) verse. The introduction of the vocal is the only change.<br>
(I compared the vocal version to the instrumental.)</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the verses more stripped back, as I suspect that I don’t typically leave enough space for vocals, including vocal layers, harmonies and effects.</p>
<p>The music on the Royksopp track isn’t a typical song structure. It’s essentially a groove-led instrumental track with vocals over the top, rather than a more formal or more clear ‘verse - pre-chorus - chorus - verse - …’ structure.<br>
That being so, it’s perhaps unsurprising that it stands alone better than music written for vocal accompaniment.</p>
<p>What it did inspire me to do/attempt is to switch up the key for the verse alternate/pre-chorus - e.g. the recurring section that first appears in my track at 1:08 (draft 2).</p>
<p>Internal key changes are another thing I need to strengthen up on - especially for the tracks containing bridges and pre-choruses.</p>
<p>Editing (down) isn’t a strength of mine, and I already suspect this piece could benefit from some thinning out.<br>
What sounds rich and layered in my head - and to my ears - likely sounds cluttered to other listeners. It’s something I need to work on - to refine my composing and editing for vocal tracks, so that it works as accompaniment for vocals, yet is still distinctly my own sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The more I listen to it, the more I’m hearing things that need to be tweaked.<br>
And I’m sure there’ll be need for plenty more once I’m at the point where vocals are going in. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>This is really engaging and interesting (speaking to your draft 2).  I’m definitely drawn to what I assume are the chorus portions:  what happens at 3:41-4:25 is epic, and I’m left wanting more of it.  It reminds me of a Gorillaz (feat. Little Dragon) track, Empire Ants, where they start what would be a brilliant retro-synthy jam at the end but it gets faded out way too soon.  Proper out-fading is a bit of a lost art, but were you so inclined, you could do something similar – just don’t hold back.</p>
<p>I don’t have a strong sense of the verses, but then again I’m not a vocals person; they were harder for me to connect with.  I had the “something’s missing” feeling, which may literally be true in this case, but I’ve been spoiled by the likes of Royksopp who somehow manage to be equally solid with/without vocals (e.g., Vision One).  <em>If</em> you wanted to pull off something similar, this track would be a great candidate.  Overall, nice work, and I’d be interested to hear more along the way.</p>
<p>P.S. I’ve never seen a W like that in a font before, and I’m always looking – impressive!</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>It’s a draft at the mo, especially structurally.<br>
It’s at least a minute longer than it should ideally be, so needs a lot of fat trimming.</p>
<p>With the main chorus melody only appearing on the stroke of 3:00, Max Martin would have a fit, falling well short of his ‘first chorus within 50 seconds’ rule. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Once I start to properly label sections, etc… it’ll start to take a better shape.<br>
(I’m also editing down ‘You Don’t Know’ as well, but got side-tracked with this inspiration tangent.)</p>
<p>However, I think the core is there. I don’t think it’s too far off from SC ‘Demo Instrumental’ stage, which I can then include in my trawling for vocalists.)</p>

            <p>I like how the lead takes off right after ~2:45, all the sounds play off each other really nicely. The drum work and sample selection are spot on too for the piece, IMO.</p>
<p>Sounds good! I know you’re still looking for a vocalist and it’s taking time, but definitely would love to hear how that sounds once it’s in place and how the structure will evolve to fit the vocals</p>
