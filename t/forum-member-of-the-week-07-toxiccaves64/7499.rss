&lt;big&gt;ToxicCaves64&lt;/big&gt;  (a.k.a T.C Music) produces Chiptunes, synth funk, and other sweet sounds with Auxy and Ableton.

And if that&#39;s not enough for you, look what he can make with only [five Auxy instruments](https://soundcloud.com/toxiccaves64/hyper-ultra-light-speed).  TC64 got talent.

            <p>Being able to make those high standard tracks every single day is surely a talent.<br>
Love the selection of sounds, rather nostalgic, but fresh. Sounds like music from 2D RPG.</p>

            <p>My biggest thoughts on your music, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TC64">@TC64</a> is that it’s cute, but detailed. Strong leads, good mixing, fun drums. I especially liked the funk you had posted from about a year ago, but no song jumped into mind since they the tracks overall were a bit repetitive, but you tapped into something cool there that might be worth revisiting.</p>
<p>My faves:</p>
<p><strong>Silver</strong> was dope. It was super fun, and I enjoyed the vocal-like sounds. I would just keep some drum beats going for longer in parts. Let me enjoy, darn you.</p>
<p><strong>Lantern</strong>: Man is that twig? God I love twig, just adds this weird acoustic sound. I enjoyed all the variations this songs went through.</p>
<p><strong>Leev ft. USDebt</strong> just had a wonderful melody. In fact, a lot of the songs chronologically before that have really cute melodies. You should continue to explore that, I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p><strong>Evolve</strong> was probably my fave out of your funk entries, and it’s very similar to <strong>Gase</strong>, which would make the former its natural progression.</p>

            <p>I like your fast-er paced chips tune kinda sounds. U have sweet transitions. Structure was kinda different but because of the genre it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>I suggest making ur songs longer and having breaks and bridges and introductions to. Basically having a better structure to your tracks.</p>
<p>Other than that you have a unique sound! Keep it up buddy</p>

            <p>The “Toxic Caves” is a level in a SEGA game that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m64iK733ZNk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">some great music</a> with a funky style that ended up inspiring some of the songs I’ve made.</p>
<p>Since I grew up with games like Super Mario 64, I ended my username with “64” to add on to the general video game theme that my music has.</p>
<p>P.S. Yeah, Odyssey is my <em>jam</em>.</p>

            <p>Ok WWOOOOOW your songs are really good. I agree with bob that it reminds me of kayasho, and that is a very good thing. You have this like funky but also video-game type style and AAHH I LOVE IT SO MUCH! Keep the great work! I’ll be sure to listen to more of your tracks in the future!</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/TC64">@TC64</a> I love the funky style of your music. It’s always full of something and never is empty. The melodies in all of your songs are amazing! The way you structure your songs is also great, adding in mini breaks, and different melodious sections within. I love it. I’ve already listened to lots of your music, but now listening to everything again makes me think that following you was the right choice.</p>
