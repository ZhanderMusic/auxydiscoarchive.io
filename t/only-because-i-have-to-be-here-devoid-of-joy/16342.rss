            <p>A sonic journey as always. I get particularly excited whenever I see a new one coming from your way because I always know my ears are in for a ride. Great work, bud!</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br>
Ummm‚Ä¶ so my SoundCloud is a bit out there and all over the place. I make music more about sounds rather melody. Lots of noise, distortion, and automations.<br>
This track uses 3 instruments (Kbass, Grain, and, angry) and a custom drum kit with a riser, 2 percussions, and a kick.</p>
