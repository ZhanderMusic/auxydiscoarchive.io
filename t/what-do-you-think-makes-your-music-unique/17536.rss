    <title>What do you think makes your music unique?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-do-you-think-makes-your-music-unique/17536</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this has been asked before but here goes!

What is it about your music that makes it *your* music?

For me, it&#39;s the increasing usage of what i like to call &#39;transcendent progressions&#39;. In a way, the chords put off a divine energy that makes my music special.

*also my abuse of pianos lol*

            <p>I Do many genres and add my touch to them. I think just your signature style is important.</p>
<p>I love future bass so much but I try to make mine different than everyone else. Just like Louis Child and their different approach on Future bass, I want to be different.</p>
<p>I don’t know really what im saying lol but yeah.</p>

            <p>Despite the genre, I think what makes my music unique is the way how I make it, and the drums and bass (drum and bass, haha). First I start off with something that can happen on accident, not a drum, but a melody/bass or something else. After that, I’m making an intro, Build etc. then, in the drop, I use a sample pack, choose a percussion loop and chop it up, and make the drums on my one. In the drop I also use 3-8 basses with automation. I make the drums myself,  most of the time with the kick 06 from the superfuildy sound pack. And a snare most of the time from a sample pack. I also think that the way I make my drums are unique in this community, I don’t know how to explain but if you want to hear it, you can go to my soundcloud and listen “claustrophobic”. Etc.</p>

            <p>I think what makes my music unique is because the tracks I make are quite simple, but very harmonic. I also have my own bass leitmotif but I don’t really use it in many of the tracks that I post</p>

            <p>My stuff is so unique no one’s ever heard it before and no one but me ever will because I rarely post</p>
<p>But actually tho, I at least try to be unique. Tho I often see myself using ideas n structures from other artists I like, I think it’s at least different from most of the stuff around here (granted I’m sure most everyone else thinks something similar lol)</p>
