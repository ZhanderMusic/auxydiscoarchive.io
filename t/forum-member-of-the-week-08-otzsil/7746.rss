            <p>The remix of secrets by Krute you did was really cool! Very groovy. The drop is amazing, and I love the future sounds and the pitch blending in the second half.</p>
<p>Long summer days has a nice piano intro. Love the chords. Love the fast toms. A very exciting song. Definitely music I’d like to listen to. The drop is really cool! I love the extra piano melody in the second half and for some reason it reminds me of the theme music from the Mario kart track coconut mall. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p>Overdrive isn’t really my style, but I like the intense melody and the heavy style.</p>
<p>Stratosphere is a show stopper like it always was. Amazing melody, and really cool drop. It makes me want to get up and dance. 10/10</p>
<p>You are an amazing creator who deserves WAY more followers. Your music is amazing! Well done.</p>

            <p>New Zealand is my favourite country! I’ve been there three times on holiday. The first time we went to the north island and spent a while in Auckland, the second time we went to the South Island and then we travelled to Australia. The most recent time we went (2013) we travelled pretty much the entirety of the South Island. We went from Christchurch and on the way around the south coast we went to Oamaru, Geraldine, Invercargill and Dunedin. This year my family and I are going to South Africa so hopefully in two years time we’ll go back to New Zealand. I think we’ve all agreed on that anyway lol</p>

            <p>Hey Otzsil,</p>
<p>Enjoyed checking out your goods this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/otzsil/long-summer-days">Long Summer days</a> -  Beachy summer song with cool key changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/otzsil/remember-the-times">Remember The Times</a> Another beachy one. Easy-listening chilled track that seriously lives up to it’s title.  Someone else wrote “Yeah I remember” on Soundcloud and that’s exactly how I felt about it. It reminds me of the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/otzsil/overdrive">Overdrive</a> - Definitely not a beachy track! Motorbikes and siren effects with bass / drums and a clubbing motif.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/otzsil/stratosphere">Stratosphere</a> - There’s a reason this has so many plays! It’s an Auxy hit.</p>
<p>It’s been a few months since we had an Otzsil original.  Have you got some more goodies brewing up for us?</p>

Your profile is <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:">. Loving your BTCs and your use of percussion as well. I’m enjoying the vibes in Remember the Times. Your tracks are pretty much perfect— I don’t have any feedback.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to be over intimidating, because I’m quite attractive. If we ever met in person, my attractiveness might make things uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard some of your music Otzsil. You’re one of the more successful Auxy producers, but I’ve never actually sat down and listened to all of your tracks. I’m looking forward to doing that this week!</p>

I love your style man, it’s really progressive and has emotion in it as well. It’s great how you have a certain style for your originals and try to experiment a little more with the BTCs. Long Summer Days and your Secrets remix are definitely my favorites of yours; real progressive house with happy drops.<br>
When looking at your upload schedule it is definitely quality over quantity for you, which is great <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"><br>
I’m curious what you have in store for us in 2018. Keep it up!</p>
