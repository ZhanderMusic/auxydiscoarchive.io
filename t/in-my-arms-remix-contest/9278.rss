    <title>In My Arms Remix Contest</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/in-my-arms-remix-contest/9278</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone,
My song In My Arms has almost got 100 plays and because of that i wanted to make a remix contest.
Listen to the song [Here](https://soundcloud.com/aviodjmusic/in-my-arms) on my soundcloud. 
The winner of the contest will get a repost of the remix and a link in my instagram and soundcloud bios for as long as you exist. I will also make a playlist of all the Remixes.I really want this to happen because it is so close to 100 and it will be a big milestone for me. 
Here are some rules:

**1.**  Your remix **won&#39;t** be chosen for the contest if it doesn&#39;t have the selected cover art.

**2.** Remixes must be public and posted on SoundCloud. If you keep them private they will not be chosen.

**3.** Remixes must be submitted by the **17th of May** AEST. If they are submitted after the due date they will still be put on the playlist but wont win any prizes.

**Winners prize**
 A repost, your SoundCloud be put in my bio for as long as you make music and i will like all of your songs and remix or collab one song.
