    <title>Auxy Loop Pack [Seeking Contributors]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-loop-pack-seeking-contributors/11292</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

As I grow more and more accustomed to a newer style of making music, I&#39;ve realized the importance of melodic and drum loops, one shots, etc. in the process of creating music. Something that I&#39;ve come to desire strongly is a sort of splice-like pack for Auxy specifically of Auxy-related instruments in looped recordings. Think of it like the free pack demos whose loops are under a CC License for free use within projects and stuff. 

With this in mind, I am going to attempt to create some Auxy-centered loops in the same style of this. I am looking for people who are interested in contributing to this. Especially those with featured projects in the feed. 

Please, let me know what sort of sounds you would like. And if you have things to contribute, you can send them to me or post them here. I will be slicing them up and eventually, with the creator&#39;s permission if I receive other&#39;s help, make these loops free to distribute and use. [spoiler]Unless of course that is not allowable in the ToS but I&#39;ve looked over the thing multiple times and it seems legitimate, please correct me if I am wrong[/spoiler]</description>

            <p>Yeah you export from Blocs Wave and select Open With (Open In?) Auxy, it will import the sample to the Auxy/Samples folder. It will tell you if the import was successful or failed (sometimes it fails the first time even if you know it’s under ten seconds, just try it twice).</p>
<p>Same rules for sample type and length apply</p>

<p><strong>do not use anything outside of the original Auxy sample pack for drums</strong> . This is because everything else is licensed from BlackOctopus, and I don’t believe that this sort of thing would be permissible or ideal</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To add a little more to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a>…</p>
<p>Legally, Auxy users aren’t required to adhere to Black Octopus’ original T&amp;Cs – only Auxy’s.<br>
It’s Auxy’s legal obligation to ensure that rights they give/pass on to Auxy users don’t infringe on any rights agreed between Auxy and BlackOctopus.</p>
<p>(Usage terms agreed with Auxy might differ from those BlackOctopus offer directly to end-users.)</p>
<p>So, if Auxy T&amp;Cs don’t distinguish between Auxy-created and 3rd-party licensed sounds, you can do it using any sound available in the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Generally speaking, reselling sounds from sound packs is prohibited if you’re simply trying to resell the generic, unaltered sounds – rather than selling music compositions created using them.</p>
<p>What you’re suggesting is effectively the same as ‘selling beats’ composed using a sample pack. Totally fine.</p>

            <p>For now I’ll pass, have actually been experimenting more with IDM/glitch and more synth heavy stuff lately, plus - not on Auxy <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=5" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>
<p>Keeping an eye out around here cause I like the workflow and I’m hoping for the best when it comes to features, but, honestly, keeping my expectations in check. There’s a wonderful world of AUv3 out there <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’m using FL on desktop for the purposes of that. Audacity is too useful for me to not utilize it, also since I want to mix and master my tracks growing more familiar with FL will greatly improve my workflow. I haven’t released in two months despite having almost six songs at an almost ready stage because I just don’t know if they’re ready xD</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, would you be interested in contributing? I’m sure some of your style with auxy would be fantastic for this sort of project, especially in the DnB department.</p>

            <p>For what it’s worth, and they play very nicely with Auxy, Blocs Wave, Launchpad and Groovebox all can export direct to Auxy. Haven’t been using Groovebox too much but Launchpad (to feed packs to Blocs Wave) has been instrumental in loop / sample works. All of them are free with a little taste of content to get you started.</p>

            <p>Very very true.</p>
<p>The main reason I wish to create these in the first place is because I want to get more experience creating music using samples, and this will be a great way for me to improve that.</p>
<p>If the devs do not wish this to be made open to the users on the forum, then I won’t send it to anyone who hasn’t contributed, as they would have obviously had premium in order to do so.</p>
<p>To be fair, if people wanted to just rip sound from songs they’d already be doing that. This is more along the lines of those packs you see for Lo-fi, trap, DnB and other stuff all over the place, and things you find on Splice. That’s where my own worries come in.</p>

<p>From what I recall, as long as you are not selling the content, it’s ok. I’m no legal-fu expert, but I don’t see how using loops from Auxy is any different than me bouncing stems from Auxy to my DAW of choice. The caveat here though is that I’m certain the devs wouldn’t want this stuff in the hands of people who don’t pay for it (the monthly sub).</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure how you’d stop that. Whether or not it <em>SHOULD</em> be stopped is a completely different discussion (sampling culture and all that) - but, hey…</p>

            <p>Anything you’d be interested in utilizing in a song pretty much. Funky effects from the synths, unique drum loops, etc.</p>
<p>I do request that if you are doing things with percussion, <strong>You do not use anything outside of the original Auxy sample pack for drums</strong>. This is because everything else is licensed from BlackOctopus, and I don’t believe that this sort of thing would be permissible or ideal (they already created a ton themselves to be fair)</p>

            <p>If you’re looking for people, I would be willing to contribute. What kind of loops are you looking for specifically?</p>
<p>Edit: I could make some nice guitar/piano/string riffs</p>
<p>Or drum loops</p>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>As I grow more and more accustomed to a newer style of making music, I’ve realized the importance of melodic and drum loops, one shots, etc. in the process of creating music. Something that I’ve come to desire strongly is a sort of splice-like pack for Auxy specifically of Auxy-related instruments in looped recordings. Think of it like the free pack demos whose loops are under a CC License for free use within projects and stuff.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I am going to attempt to create some Auxy-centered loops in the same style of this. I am looking for people who are interested in contributing to this. Especially those with featured projects in the feed.</p>
<p>Please, let me know what sort of sounds you would like. And if you have things to contribute, you can send them to me or post them here. I will be slicing them up and eventually, with the creator’s permission if I receive other’s help, make these loops free to distribute and use. <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-loop-pack-seeking-contributors/11292/1">spoiler</a></span></p>
