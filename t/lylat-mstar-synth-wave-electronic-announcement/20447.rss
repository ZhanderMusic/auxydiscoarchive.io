    <title>Lylat - mstar (synth wave/electronic) + Announcement</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/lylat-mstar-synth-wave-electronic-announcement/20447</link>
    <description>Even though this track is 2 months old, I&#39;d figure I should post this track on the disco.

An interesting fact about this track, for some of the background percussion, I utilized some samples from the original Star Fox (SNES) game.

Also, I&#39;m sorry for not really being active on here (life and school, oof). More music is in the works!

Cheers!
