    <title>A little help with Reverb!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-little-help-with-reverb/17993</link>
    <description>I think the &quot;new&quot; reverb is often *way* too much.

I have a hard time getting the results I use to be able to get before the update that allowed us to manipulate the Size, Decay, Damping, etc...  Before, I could just turn up the verb, and it was g2g. 

Now, I usually end up having to turn the verb knob down to 1 or 2, or just not use it at all. I&#39;ve been experimenting with it for a while - thinking I&#39;d eventually get the hang of it, but I&#39;m still having issues.

I&#39;ve tried turning the size/decay down and the damping up, but alas, I still can&#39;t get the sound I want.

I just want a good/simple verb for my leads, snares/hats. 

Maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong? 

Auxy community - where do YOU normally set your verb for leads? Snares? 
Where do you set the lowpass? highpass? 

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Yeah I can confirm:</p>
<p>So I opened an old project link of mine from last year and it had a drum kit. When I tapped ‘Update’ for the samples, the reverb for the snare was way higher (without adjusting any dials)</p>

            <p>Volume higher than default, then fine tune pass dials at low levels, then adjust pass in advanced reverb.</p>

            <p>When we updated all the sounds we noticed that we had forgotten to compensate for a gain change that we do before the effect section. So the reverb level is relatively higher than before. It might be that the curvature for the reverb knob is a bit different for drums than for other instruments though. Will investigate to see if it needs tweaking. In any case, this just means that the dial is a bit different, but you should still be able to get the same settings.</p>

            <p>Yeah! Thanks!</p>
<p>This helps a bunch.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m a bit surprised you sometimes set your instrument verb size to 100.<br>
Just seems like a lot to me at times, but I’ll definitely give these a try!</p>

<p>this is what I usually set my reverb to for instruments! not a lot but not too much. It’s what I used for my second round auxy tournament submission for the piano!</p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/pFwpFOXYj187qOF9wxRQcatM5xs.jpeg?dl=1" title="image" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e_2_555x500.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pFwpFOXYj187qOF9wxRQcatM5xs" width="555" height="500" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e_2_555x500.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/optimized/2X/b/b3e7f2c264d4b00e9618de46c167eedb6872663e_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>is what I’d set it to for my drums! Most specifically the snare and rides. I like to add reverb to my rides to create a slight tail to connect each ride so they don’t sound ‘stocky’, as well as to create a coherent movement on each placement. As for the snares, I tend to overly use reverb on my snares to give it that extra power but if you’re looking for a more general and pre auxy 5 type of reverb, I think the setting I’ve listed above is similar.</p>
<p>I had to tweak with the settings a lot because the Decay and Size on the reverb settings creates a lot of dimension; as if you’re playing an instrument in a giant empty parking lot, whereas Damping and Size just almost creates a delay, similar to the 1/64 delay but more blended. Decay is the key to creating that pre auxy 5 reverb and I’ve found out using the high pass and low pass filters on those settings actually levels out how powerful that decay is in general, so a combination of all those worked well with that.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>YES. That’s exactly how I feel!</p>
<p>I posted something about this a while back  and an Auxy moderator said, “But it’s the same reverb…”</p>
<p>A few people thought it was funny…</p>
<p>At least now I know I’m not crazy, lol</p>
