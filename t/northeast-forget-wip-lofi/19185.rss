I’m trying to make a Lofi track, and I feel like there’s a lot missing, including variation. IDM if the instruments or note order are changed, as long as it isn’t too major.</description>

            <p>Yo. I did some stuff with it. If you’re going for a lofi kinda track, a good kind of feeling to try and get is <em>warmth.</em> Your chords were pretty good for that! I changed the synth and added a sliiiiight bitcrusher distortion to give it that more lofi vibe. The drums aren’t perfect, but more of an approximation of what feels good — more organic and subdued kits are usually the way to go when it comes to lofi. I also did some changes to your melody and added in a persistent bass line (change the level if it’s too loud). Pretty good stuff for me to work with. You’re doing pretty good.</p>
