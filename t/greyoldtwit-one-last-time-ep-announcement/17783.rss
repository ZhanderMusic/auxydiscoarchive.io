    <title>GreyOldTwit - One Last Time [EP] + Announcement</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/greyoldtwit-one-last-time-ep-announcement/17783</link>
    <description>GreyOldTwit - One Last Time [EP] is out now on Spotify and this release is a special release. This will be the last release under the name of GreyOldTwit. No I’m not leaving music making or Auxy (as I just got Auxy Jam recently), I just believe that my old name is more of a gaming name rather than a music artist name. 

Sticking with a similar theme however, I’ve decided to call myself GR3Y. There’s not much more I can say at this point, but to enjoy the music under GreyOldTwit... for one last time.
