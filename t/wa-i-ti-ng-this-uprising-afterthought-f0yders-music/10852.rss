    <description>A little something to listen to after This Uprising. A little less messy, but still in the same boat. All feedback is appreciated.

<p>A good groove.</p>
<p>Feels a bit underdeveloped*, but still enjoyed it in its current form.</p>
<p>* Not suggesting anything major. I think it’s good precisely for its subtlety. But, maybe some additional subtle moments or layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[Edit: The more I listen to it (just started my 3rd listen), the more it grows on me. Nice work.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Particularly like that drop-out transition moment. Nice touch. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
Also, like the fade in and fade out at the start and end. Shows an understanding that it’s a mellow groove. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
