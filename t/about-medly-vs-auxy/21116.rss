    <title>About “Medly vs, Auxy”</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/about-medly-vs-auxy/21116</link>
    <description>You talk about how Medly copies off Auxy. Then Auxy says they didn’t invent many of the concepts it’s built on. Then Auxy copies undo and redo from Medly.

Why do you still hate on Medly? I use both in the same song a lot of the time.

Apparently other people do too:

Why don’t you actually try it instead of wasting time saying “AUXY IS BETTER THAN MEDLY”?

Although I think it is by a touch.</description>

<p>Yeah I drank like ten beers the other night and saw your question + wanted to check out the status of the app it’s been awhile.</p>
<p>Looking at all this again reminds me how much of a pain in the ass it is to do very simple things on iOS/iPadOS lol…</p>

            <p>Cheers, bud.<br>
(Good to see your name pop up here again.)</p>
<p>I’ll def check out those options.</p>
<p>Ideally looking for one that can also ingest MP4, as I’m increasingly finding myself capturing a sample using iPad’s screen recording.</p>
<p>AudioShare seems like a good place to start — especially with the plug-in support, in case I wanna try throwing a little dirt on something. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=12" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>imo AudioShare is still king. For quick and dirty edits, quick cleanup, conversion (plus you can resample through AUv3 effects if you wanna) it’s tough to beat. It’s very lean. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audioshare/id543859300" class="inline-onebox">‎AudioShare on the App&nbsp;Store</a></p>
<p>If you’re looking to do A LOT of sample cutting (ie, setting multiple markers across a loop and dumping out all the slices) you’re going to want to check out ReSlice or possibly sEGments by Elliot Garage.</p>

<p>THE ONLY caveat I’ll say about ReSlice is that it will only export the slices as 32bit wave files which Auxy won’t ingest. You’ll need to convert them in something like AudioShare. I can’t speak to sEGments personally, I haven’t used it, but it sounds like it ticks all the boxes.</p>

            <p>I took a little look into the Medly features – and that sample start-point/end-point editing looks tasty.<br>
It would allow me to get more mileage out of a single sample file — e.g. rather than having to chop up samples outside of Auxy.</p>
<p>As you say, for those with ready-prepped samples, Auxy’s good, but that simple sample editor would still be a pretty good tool to have.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/iammane">@iammane</a> Q: What’s the best iOS option for quick editing, chopping, etc… samples (that can then be exported out to my usual iCloud/Files samples folder)?</p>
<p>(Don’t mind paying for a good option. Easier than having to always switch to laptop.)</p>

            <p>I would say I am the most objective when it comes to whatever is available on iOS, and I would say unless there’s been some kind of miracle whatever Auxy has on offer is just (sound wise) better than Medly. I do think there’s a lot that’s done better, ie, automation over patterns, key matching etc - but I will also say from what I’ve seen there’s just more vocal content (as far as what’s built in) than Auxy, plus re-pitch makes it more accessible.</p>
<p>I think pound for pound those with well prepped samples would be happier with Auxy overall</p>

            <p>I agree, that is why I sketch some ideas in Auxy, export the audio, add it into medly, then maybe add vocals. Alone, Auxy is great, and medly is great, but together, they make an AMAZING team.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Decided to check out some Medly output and stumbled on this…</p>
<p>Now, aside from the fact that it’s nice to see the app company put some effort into engaging with and acknowledging user tracks, and generate some marketing material…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSCUcV8mJDE?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSCUcV8mJDE</a></p>

<p>The thing that stands out most is that the tracks included/promo’s are largely vocal tracks.<br>
I can’t speak to how well integrated vocal features are in Medly, but I think the fact that it’s a prominent feature makes it part of the production ‘mindset’ of their users.</p>
<p>For me, as tight and bumping as some high-end Auxy tracks are, it’s the inclusion/absence of vocals which can set a track apart and give it that ‘radio ready’ vibe and commercial appeal.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t know how well Auxy could ever seek to integrate vocal recording features, but the absence of it might just be hurting output without them really knowing it, by framing Auxy as fundamentally an instrumental music app.</p>
<p>(Side-note: I’ve got a couple of recent, very early sketches that I might rebuild in Medly and develop there, to give it a spin.)</p>

            <p>Auxy and medly both copy concepts from powerful daws, only simplify them to make best use of our mobile devices abilities. Even though Auxy was released a year before medly, they both have their pros and cons. Differences and similarities. It’s like comparing FL studio to Ableton, both powerhouses. It all comes down to person preference. And if you’re here in this forum, you most likely have chosen Auxy:)</p>

            <p>I’ve used medly and for me personally it seems weaker in terms of synth design that auxy. Medly just doesn’t have the strong sounds I need for my house-y style. That’s only my opinion tho and my experience</p>

            <p>Historically, this discussion never ends well. I’m pretty sure undo and redo have been around since like… computers. So I don’t think anyone is copying anyone or whatever (Cubasis has undo and redo, Gadget has undo and redo, GarageBand has undo and redo - are they all copycats??)</p>
<p>I think there’s some features of Medly that are really good (automation visible over notes, audio import, time shift, re-key) and I think there’s stuff about Auxy that’s really good (just sounds GREAT (thanks Sonic Charge et al), automations are not combined with note data so you can mix and match, a proper drum sampler etc).</p>
<p>I’ve used both, they both have their place. At the end of the day the tool doesn’t matter too much, if you’re writing music and having fun then really that’s all that matters.</p>
