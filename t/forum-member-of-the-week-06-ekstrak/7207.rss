            <p>Like your more dubstep-ish tracks like tick tock, bipolar and midnight drive, though your dance and EDM stuff really isn’t for me. Reborn seems cool too.<br>
Feed back on some tracks:<br>
Tick Tock-<br>
Really cool atmospheric song! I think you really nailed that sort of eerie and dark vibe that fits well with dubstep.<br>
Bipolar-<br>
Great track with the nice melodic parts of your songs and the heavy insane drops of Xiejra!<br>
You’ve got some really great tracks!</p>

            <p>Wow, Stardust is amazing! Great chorus. Maybe some more bass in the beginning though? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Wow, I don’t know why I haven’t checked out your latest songs before! Loving the dubstep vibes on Reborn, it’s great that you took on an rare Auxy genre. Great beat in Tick Tock VIP, but I think you should add some more chords though. Other than that, you’ve got a pretty great profile! <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Xicon">@Xicon</a></p>
<p>Listening to some more of your tracks. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Ok so I listened to a few of your tracks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Xicon">@Xicon</a> , and they’re quite diverse (FB, DnB &amp; House), which is cool! I’m really curious how the full album will sound, the preview sounds really cool! Stardust is good as well.<br>
Tip: Be careful when using bass leads. In Stage Three and Tick Tock VIP the bass has a little distortion and there’s a little too much going on in the drop soundwise.<br>
Keep it up! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Alright just finished looking over your tracks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Xicon">@Xicon</a>.</p>
<p>First off, I like your style. It is really creative and unique.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind, I have some tips for you-</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes your tracks can be a bit simple, and it wouldn’t hurt to structure them better</li>
<li>Some of your tracks just feel like they are missing something (I’m not sure, maybe better-developed chords or ambience in the background?)</li>
<li>I feel like sometimes the songs get a little underwhelming for me</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re on the right track man, don’t get me wrong. Just try to make your songs a bit more complex, add some more melodies, and I think you’ll be good to go <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
So far, good work!</p>

            <p>I love the chords and just general calm feeling of tritanopia. My favourite song of u so far! Also that awesome album preview! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/heart_eyes.png?v=5" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"> Keep it up buddy.</p>
<p>Some feedback:<br>
Maybe try keep the distortion a bit down for some tracks. Other than that you are doing great! Looking forward to your reborn album</p>
<p>Also try keeping the reposts down a bit</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback!<br>
The songs in there are my projects, except for the DnB part and the second song. The First song is a collab with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xiejra">@Xiejra</a> and the second is a remake of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/neon-element-1">Neon Element.</a><br>
So I guess you can say it’s sll my traks.</p>

            <p>Checked out your tracks, focusing on the one’s you did alone.</p>
<p>The best parts were the industrial intro for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/stage-three">Stage 3</a>, the D’n’B in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/tick-tock-vip">Tick Top VIP</a> &amp; the funky lead at the start of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/midnight-drive">Midnight Drive</a> which is a sound I always enjoy hearing.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shane-brown-97094682/reborn-preview">Reborn Preview</a> seems to take things to a whole new level, but not sure if those are your own tracks, remixes or collabs being previewed?</p>

            <p>Ekstrak - your tracks are really cool and are really a step in the different direction from other tracks out there in the community. I want you to know that you deserve more followers too. I’ll comment and like some of your tracks later when I have time.</p>

            <p>Your stuff is really interesting (to say the least). Its really not the style of stuff I listen to but its not bad. I think the only feedback I can give is to not have your basses so loud ijn your drops. They have a lot of sub bass and it throws you off if you’re wearing headphones.</p>

            <p>Ok i just finished listening to all your songs!<br>
I must say i really liked your style i think the flaw of your songs is it needs a better arrangement.<br>
My favorite tracks of yours are<br>
-Tritanopia: Really liked the vibes and the melody<br>
-Midnight Drive: Very good for your first try on Future Bass!<br>
-Bipolar: Really liked this one too it is different!<br>
-Stardust: Must say this is really cool.<br>
Overall your music is really nice!</p>
