    <title>What to do with Featured tracks and how to remix them</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-to-do-with-featured-tracks-and-how-to-remix-them/3470</link>
    <description>Just a few things: featured tracks are not really intended for remixing. Even then, I&#39;d say about 75% of those people who remix tracks do it just for the sake of remixing, or because they really like the song, and don&#39;t actually change anything about the song save for a few changes in the instruments playing the already given loops. Uploading these &quot;remixes&quot; is basically just plagiarism, and I&#39;ve already made clear my stance on that. Another problem: screen capturing artwork and using it without permission. This has been an incredibly common thing to do. Artists or people they hire take a long time to create that, and if you take it and use it for purposes such as artwork for SoundCloud, however much you altered it in any way, is illegal, especially without asking, (1) and without giving credit for the original photo (2). And if you steal both the music AND the artwork, then that&#39;s obviously illegal. (I&#39;ll just add that it should go without saying that you DEFINITELY CAN NOT upload to anything that you can make money off of, such as iTunes, Spotify, or Youtube unless you get direct permission to do so from the original artist) also, with Youtube: don&#39;t just straight up upload tracks from the featured tracks list in the app, even if you can&#39;t make money off of it. 

BOTTOM LINE: Don&#39;t upload any remix, edit, or flip to ANYTHING without the artist giving you permission. Change more than instruments in any remix (try changing notes, automations for a change!). Get the artwork from the ARTIST ONLY with permission. And finally, try learning from a track instead of just wanting to remix it right away. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really would love to see a remix with all of the above rules met. Get creative! 
Thanks guys!</description>

            <p>As long as you say it’s a bootleg remix, I think it’s completely fine. I mean, as long as you give credit to the original artist.</p>
<p>I’m actually planning on doing a few bootleg remixes with Auxy and FL for audio so I might be biased. =P</p>

            <p>Possibly stupid question, but what are people’s views on bootleg remixes - especially of tracks by major recording artists?</p>
<p>Always bad? No exceptions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(To be clear, I think taking someone’s work and simply rebadging it as your own is disgusting, low and unacceptable.)</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t a project lock feature just help this entire situation? If you were to lock the project, you would make it so that you can’t duplicate the project, change anything about the project, or copy instruments among other things.</p>
<p>Is this thesible for Auxy?</p>

            <p>Nah, did you even see his point? I did not make that private track with his permission. I just used some sketchy Soundcloud download site and distorted it and added tons of volume towards the end. And I’m not posting publicly lol</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>why would i post it publicly<br>
there is no point</p>
