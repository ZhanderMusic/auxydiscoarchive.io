            <p>I have been busy and, technically speaking, “grounded”, but not really grounded…so, it’ll be a while before I return to the forum again!!<br>
Maybe months, before I return…<br>
Later!</p>

It means a lot to know that people actually like me and support me i guess. I make music as an outlet for depression.Its a way i can not think about everything going on in my life. I also write raps about the problems in my life and i want to be able to make rap music sometime in the future. For now tho because i cant afford a mic ill just have to produce. Thanks to everyone for the support and ill make sure to continue to support the rest of the people who get Forum Member of the Week.</p>
<p>Also, lately its felt like FMOTW has been ignored. Idk if its because most people have already got it or because people are getting bored of it. I just wanted to put it out there that its becoming less popular.</p>
