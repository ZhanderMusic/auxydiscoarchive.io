    <title>Reverb post-update</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/reverb-post-update/16340</link>
    <description>Is it just me, or is anyone else finding that after updating their sounds the reverb on everything sounds too much? I’ve really been trying to dial it back, although I now appreciate how much effort the developers put into finding nice reverb settings for each sound... note this month’s Sound pack features reverbs that are heavily dampened to give it that more muted ambient feel...

I’d be interested to hear where people are feeling comfortable with the damping and LPF controls, I feel confident using one or the other, but not sure how they interact... I find I’m generally between 35% to 50% on the damping, LPF depends on how bright it sounds after the damping...</description>

            <p>I find it quite easy to shape the reverb back to its original state but then again I’m used to more complex DAWs.</p>

            <p>Study a few of the “preset” reverbs that they have made for the instruments; you will notice that many of them aggressively shape the reverb using the HPF and LPF. Depends on what Sound you’re looking for, but a good trick to know</p>

            <p>I use lowpass for intro, verses, and buildups (including sweeper). I rarely use highpass though. It’s kind of like a simplified EQ eight.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I used to just turn reverb all the way up and for many scenarios it would be perfect. Now I have to fiddle it around 1/2 to 3/4 to get the same effect or the reverb goes on for daaaaaaaays</p>

            <p>That makes a lot of sense actually. I’ve also found that with a few instruments using a lot of reverb, there tends to be a lot of overlap and the reverb takes over the mix.</p>

            <p>HPF, I almost always take off everything under 250 to 300, keeps the reverb much cleaner, no mud</p>

            <p>Yep, I definitely feel the same way. It sounds like the previous reverb if you just reduce the size and decay, and add some damping. For the drums, the reverb sounds even louder, but it’s pretty easy to tune down.</p>
<p>I personally think it’s a good feature if you want a LOT of reverb, and it works for a little bit of reverb as well. IMO, flexibility, especially with the size controls, is quite handy!</p>
<p>Ooh I forgot, so Edit: the low pass and highpass filters are cool too, but I don’t find myself using them often. I normally leave them where they are as default, but I guess those knobs can fit super specific needs.</p>
