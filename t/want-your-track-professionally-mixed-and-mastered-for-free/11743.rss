    <title>Want your track professionally mixed and mastered... FOR FREE?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/want-your-track-professionally-mixed-and-mastered-for-free/11743</link>
    <description>Hey, y&#39;all, it&#39;s your friendly neighborhood audio engineer, Nick Elle.

I recently got [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) (a top of the line DAW, bigger than Logic, FL, or Ableton Live), and I&#39;m just now getting into it. I am slowly getting used to it, but it&#39;s taking a long time, because I mix and master my own stuff in my choice of DAW, Ableton Live.
I need more practice to fully learn Pro Tools

So, I was wondering if anyone would like me to mix and master their track, just as practice for me.
If so, let me know.
I&#39;ll only be taking a few applicants.

Ps. I normally charge $100 per mix and master, so take this deal while you can. ;)

- Nick</description>

            <p>Yes, Logic is good for both, but there is a minor error in the coding which causes a tiny bit of distortion when bounced. (I believe… I’ve not heard it myself, but my Grammy Award winning peers tell me it does.)</p>
<p>Also, you are right that different DAWs do different things, but I’ve actually had luck with engineering in Live.<br>
It’s very different, but I made it work.</p>

            <p>Different daws have thier purpose. Ive had live, LPX and PT for years now. PT is good for post production stuff. Esp when working with audio. Ableton live is good for production. In my opinion LPX is good for both, but PT being better for post production. But LPX being better for production than anything else on the market. Just my opinion.<br>
Yea bro ill throw a track or two. Just to see you throw down.</p>
