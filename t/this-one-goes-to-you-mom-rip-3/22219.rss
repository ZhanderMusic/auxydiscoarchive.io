            <p>Appreciate that, lost her on Friday 13th of last year… She was a Spiritual being of pure Love and Light who bravely fought Cancer through homeopathic needs for 8 years… It tried to take her away 4 years into her battle, but she conquered it and LITERALLY defied medical odds and got another 4 years out of life… She spent her last days in Washington, a lifelong friend had brought her in with my little brother… She loved being around all the trees and water, the air was easier on her lungs and she didn’t need oxygen tanks just to be okay… She met a boyfriend that was so supportive and similar to her spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and they were just perfect for each other…  since her Husband, my step dad, passed shes never found a good one…I felt appreciative for that… she finished her last days in this lifetime surrounded by people who loved and supported her unconditionally… she volunteered at the local co op daily, and worked as much as she could despite what she had going on health wise, and did everything in her power to follow her strict regiments to fight for her life…</p>
<p>She was such an inspiration, and her contributions to life and the people she had affected will live on forever…As will her soul and spirit.  All she cared about was helping others…. I got to be there the moment she took her last breath and I will never forget it, but blessed I was able to make it down and be there……. In the end, I do believe music is my “God given talent” as the phrase goes, so maybe in one way shape or form, if my lifelong passion, can help any of you, I am happier beyond belief and passing on the torch of Love and Light just like her, in my own special way…<br>
