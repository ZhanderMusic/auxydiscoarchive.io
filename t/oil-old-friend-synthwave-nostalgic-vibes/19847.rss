    <title>OIL — Old Friend, [Synthwave, Nostalgic vibes]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/oil-old-friend-synthwave-nostalgic-vibes/19847</link>
    <description>I found a very old (3 or so years old) project lying in the descriptions of one of my privated SoundCloud songs. It was a WIP, and listening to it again, it wasn’t that bad. [So I loaded it up](https://soundcloud.com/somethingcooliguess/friend) and up-mixed it.

[I like to think I’ve come a long way.](https://soundcloud.com/oil-official/old-friend)

I hope that you improve every day. Even if it’s just by a little.</description>
