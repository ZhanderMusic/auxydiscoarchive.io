    <title>Mass music upload this month</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mass-music-upload-this-month/20750</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to be uploading 62 of the music tracks I&#39;ve made since August to my YouTube channel sometime next week as I spend this week rendering all of the videos. I will not, however, be uploading them to my SoundCloud as I have completely run out of upload time.

Hoping at least someone might find some interest in this, and look forward to the upload.
I&#39;ll share all the tracks here as a playlist on the day I upload them.</description>

            <p>I’m currently planning on uploading the tracks Monday, and making them public on Tuesday, though depending on a few different factors, that may be pushed back to Wednesday.<br>
Additionally, seeing as most people will likely not have the time to listen to all 62 tracks, I’ll be putting together smaller playlist of what I believe to be the 10 best of the 62 tracks.</p>
<p>Anyways, as before, hoping at least someone might find some interest in this, and look forward to it.</p>
