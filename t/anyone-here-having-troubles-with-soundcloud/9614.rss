    <title>Anyone here having troubles with soundcloud?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/anyone-here-having-troubles-with-soundcloud/9614</link>
    <description>Hello! So I logged into soundcloud today, and My account was not working at all. I tried logging in on my computer, tablet, and phone. It was all down. Then I checked my soundcloud page AuxyReposts, and It said it was deleted. Is anyone else having these problems? 

P.S. Here is what I found on the issue. ![Apr30problems|690x271](upload://mcp2ma80xPwZMZGO0s1Bn6xEGfD.PNG)</description>
