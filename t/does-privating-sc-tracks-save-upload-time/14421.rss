    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/does-privating-sc-tracks-save-upload-time/14421</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been wondering about this for a while and I thought someone here might know. Does making a track on SoundCloud private add back upload minutes? I haven&#39;t used up all my quota yet but I will at some point.</description>

            <p>I don’t think so but I’m not 100% sure. I think not because SC probably doesn’t want people to use it as a ‘file storage’ site, even if others can’t access it.</p>
