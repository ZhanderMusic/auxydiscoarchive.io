            <p>Fwiw, with Distrokid, you can set your own ISRC code or, if you leave that field empty, they’ll create one for you. (Packages start at $20/year for unlimited releases.)</p>
<p>It’s likely other paid services also let you do that.</p>
<p>Worth looking into.</p>

<p>a better idea might be to release singles from the album earlier, and then use the singles’ same ISRCs when you release the full album later.</p>

<p>Do you know if that would effectively merge the singles with the matching ISRC codes, or at least mirror the plays stats, playlist placements, etc…</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>You generally aren’t allowed to edit releases after they’re published – while Amuse and other distributors will let you change artwork or other smaller details about a release, they’re not gonna let you add another track. While they do have the <em>capability</em> to do this, indie distributor’s won’t let you. (Even if they did, it would be a big pain to do it manually – ironic, because that’s what the app is for, making the process easier)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kanye updated tracks on Pablo over the first few months after release, so it’s definitely possible somehow - though that might just be because he’s a major artist, so gets special treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Like AKA said, Kanye likely could have it done because he’s a big artist. Because he’s signed to a sublabel of UMG, his distribution is handled by UMG, which is one of the biggest labels in the world. Not only do they have their own in-house digital distribution services, they also almost certainly have a lot of clout and can convince Spotify to do more complex metadata updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tl;dr – no, you can’t. just release the album all at once. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>While trying to edit a release to add tracks is probably a bad idea regardless of whether it’s allowed, a better idea might be to release singles from the album earlier, and then use the singles’ same ISRCs when you release the full album later.</p>

<p>Holistically, the platforms feel VERY disjointed. I get they’re all different companies and service providers, but yeah, having to full on delete / remove catalog items and re-upload seems a hot mess (if I bought something on iTunes, then it was removed and re-uploaded, I’d bet cash on the fact I’d need to re-buy from Apple).</p>
<p>I don’t know it’s the fault of the platforms, but maybe a hold over from the old “record industry” paradigm?</p>
<p>Feel like I’m ranting now? I dunno lol.<br>
TL;DR - I agree, and wish there was a better more controllable way.</p>

            <p>Kanye updated tracks on Pablo over the first few months after release, so it’s definitely possible somehow - though that might just be because he’s a major artist, so gets special treatment.</p>
<p>With Distrokid, the advice is to delete the album and reupload with the updated tracks/track order.</p>
<p>That’s just janky and I would have expected things to be more connected and straightforward than that in a digital age.<br>
It potentially means losing all the previous plays as it’s treated like a new instance of the album/track, rather than an update to an existing album/track.</p>
<p>When I asked them, Distrokid said that they’d “heard rumours” that using the same ISRC codes might help you keep existing play counts, playlist placements, original release dates, etc… but they weren’t sure about it.</p>
<p>Pretty lame state for a mature industry to be in (digital music distribution).</p>

            <p>No, that’s not possible on any distributor as far as I know. Some professionals can do an iTunes Pre-Order thing, but that’s a bit different.</p>
