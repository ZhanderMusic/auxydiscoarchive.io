    <title>Midi keyboard in auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/midi-keyboard-in-auxy/21680</link>
    <description>Been working on my music with auxy for a lot of years, everything would be eassier for me and i think for a lot of people if we can use in our productions a midi controller. Please make it possible soon, that would be a big step for the app.

Thank you ;)</description>

            <p>Been asking for live recording for years, whether it be via a built in keyboard/pad type thing or external midi controller (including midi sending apps).  Was always told it would require a huge amount of work to make that possible.  Hope that work is being done!</p>
