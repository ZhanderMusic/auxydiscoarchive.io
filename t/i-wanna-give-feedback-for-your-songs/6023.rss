    <title>I wanna give feedback for your songs!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-wanna-give-feedback-for-your-songs/6023</link>
    <description>I know that Alyen made his “I wanna hear your music” thread but I feel like sometimes specific feedback is really needed. This thread is for single sons only. Please don’t spam it with a constant barrage of your songs. I have created this to allow serious legitimate feedback. Please no joking or memes in this thread. I also enjoy a joke but this is not the place. If your songs sucks I’m in a say it sucks. If it’s aweosme I’m gonna say ids awesome. If I hate he overuse of sweepers I’m gonna say it. Please note most feedback is my opinion so it is not necessarily shared by all. If you want to know yet inspired me to do this it is that I followe the tracks and collabs category but it was overwhelming since it wasn’t a list. If you feel you must explain the song do so along with the link but the post is preferred to be just a link. Once again, do not get offended if I say I don’t like your song, I’m trying to give honest feedback. Also please no multi-projects (albums, els, etc.) as they will be skipped. I hope this turns into something productive and helpful for the community and I can make a difference through it. Thanks :)</description>

            <p>We’ve had a few threads posted this week, with people offering to review tracks.  At first there was just one thread, then two and now others are copying the idea.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to provide feedback on a track, the best way to do it is by responding to threads in the <a class="hashtag" href="https://disco.auxy.co/c/7-tracks">#<span>tracks</span></a> category.  We all know that anyone who posts a song in the tracks category wants your feedback, so we don’t need a new seperate thread for each individual reviewer.</p>
<p>This thread is being closed now, to stop others from copying it.</p>

            <p>Teach me the way of the drum. Please. I have no clue how to make any drums sound remotely good xD I love it o.O like seriously usually I’m not a big fan of drums on songs but these are like omg.</p>
<p>Get some tags on there though, that helps with getting algorithm plays. Every little bit counts!</p>

            <p>Thanks. I kinda agree with the drums they were a little loud at parts <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> thanks for the feedback.<br>
I’m also working on melodic varieties. Something I’m getting better at</p>

            <p>Overall, I liked the track! Very chill and smooth kind of feel. Just a few things I noticed.</p>
<p>At 0:23 the kick came in a little too strong as well as the claps and symbol. maybe a little volume and/or low pass automation would be nice to kind of bring them in smoother. That goes for each time they happen.<br>
Maybe later in the song you could try and change up the melody a little, just to spice it up and also maybe condense one or two scenes because there were some parts that were kind of repetitive imo. Good song!<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/therealjfalc">@TheRealJFalc</a> ik that you made that thread which was closed down about trying out your reviewing skills. Here’s your chance! It seems stupid but I’m really proud of this track so I wanted to know what you think. (I also chose OJ because you posted three songs in this thread). Any feedback would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>I like it. I think the melody could use some work on some sections. The instruments could also use some work. Whichever piano at the 145 ish section sounds kinda harsh for the songs overall feel. I honk that with the right instruments and some low pass it would be much smoother (I love lowpass <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">) overall nice feel. Kinda tropical and vibes but the pianos mess that up a bit. Thanks for sharing</p>

            <p>Okay so first off. I like this track a lot. But you already knew that. I suppose things you could do to make it better… hmmm. I suppose adding drum varieties would be cool. Especially at the beginning the drums are kinda simple. This isn’t necessarily bad but if you add some minute, almost unnoticeable details it can really spice up the track. The second half is my favorite part though. It actually reminds me a lot of my own music, which is probably why I like it so much. I would love to do a remix of this and see if I could take it a slightly different direction while keeping the overall vibe.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how backed up this is, but I just released a song and would love some feedback. (If it’s ok to get feedback twice, otherwise you can just skip this) <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:">https://soundcloud.com/trey-218274248/small-time<br>
Enjoy!</p>
