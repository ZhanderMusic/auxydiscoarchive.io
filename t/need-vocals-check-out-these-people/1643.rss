            <p>My vocals are admittedly poor, but thank-you for putting me on this list. To be more specific I am better at writing songs or ghostwriting raps then recording them over tracks as preferably demos. Then with the lyrics and demo track you guys could go ahead and find a vocalist who can execute your vision better! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/3.png?v=5" title=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t3:"> I could try my best to do vocals if anyone really wants, but since I don’t have the best equipment yet or top level skill it’s a bit more challenging to get the optimal results right now. But for written songs, hit me up with a mood, intention, storyline, point of view, topic or subjects and I can write for you guys! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> So much talent in the Auxy community and i’d love to collab with you guys in that way.</p>
