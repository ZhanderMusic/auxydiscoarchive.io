    <title>Get your music featured in my radio show!</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I own and host a radio show and lately I’ve been working on completely reinventing it and improving it however I can.  We post an episode every month now so be sure to send in your demos to be featured in the May episode!
Recently I’ve opened up a new service to take demos for the show.  I’ve created a discord server where you can post your demos for the show and also connect with other artists to collab and get feedback.  Eventually we will also have a section in the server where you can apply to become a guest dj for the show, but for the moment this isn’t available yet.
Join the server and get featured in the show here!

            <p>As for listener numbers to be totally honest I’m not 100% sure at the moment and I’ve been really inactive with this lately because some parts of it were getting difficult and I’ve also been working on improving it behind the scenes</p>

            <p>Of course I accept all genres!  The only things I can’t accept are remixes, bootlegs, or mashups due to copyright</p>
