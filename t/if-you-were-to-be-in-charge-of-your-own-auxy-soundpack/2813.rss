            <p>My AP pack will not be focused on a certain type of sound, in fact, a variety of sounds and synths!<br>
I’d would most likely call it “Ajacent Wonders”</p>
<p>Well… mainly effects <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<hr>
<p>Effects:<br>
“Skyline”: A sound effect based on the night time sounds from the birds eye view of New York, like that wind, traffic, police sirens, try imagining it to understand what I mean.</p>
<p>“Crowd”: An audience sound effect! How does that sound? Give the listener and fans the feeling like you’re performing at a concert in your own little music production room.</p>
<p>“Software”: Basically using all the sounds in iOS in one “drum kit”.</p>
<p>“Blast”: An airhorn, basically.</p>
<hr>
<p>Drum kit:</p>
<p>“Bit”: An 8 bit based drum kit, bringing the retro to the future of music making.</p>
<hr>
<p>Synths:<br>
“Float”: That calming yet amazing synth that you would hear in a lot of Future Bass songs, for example, Virtual Riot - Stay for a While.</p>
<p>“Chips”: That square synth we all heard back in the day, ahh the golden age of games… Now imagine using it in your own Auxy track!</p>
<hr>
<p>Bass:<br>
“Ripple”: A bass that was meant to be with the innovative Automation, meant to be used for your wubby wubs you’ve imagined.</p>

            <p>Beyond any doubt I would bring retro VG sounds to Auxy, tuned to modern usage yet retaining their nostalgia. Chiptunes would rejoice forever.</p>

            <p>Well I’d do a mix of all sorts of instruments including synths, sampled real instruments, drums, pads, and FX. I’d include more than a hundred sounds and charge a little extra than a regular pack as like a huge “big pack” deal.</p>

            <p>I would add some more sound effects and drums</p>
<p>FX<br>
Vinyl Crackle<br>
Rain<br>
Urban Ambience<br>
"Cave Hum"</p>
<p>DRUMS<br>
Orchestral<br>
Kitchen (banging on pots)<br>
Jazz/Latin<br>
A super deep, reverby bass drum + other ambient-ish sounds (idk)</p>
<p>That is all</p>

            <p>If you were to be in charge of your own Auxy soundpack, what would you include?</p>
