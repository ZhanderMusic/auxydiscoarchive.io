            <p>In the end I have to say do something original. All these songs are fantastic but for an album I think something completely different would be much cooler. If you do have constraints my pick for the remix would be 14, as I am a music theory junkie and love harmonic minor x3</p>

            <p>trying to remember the challenge for BTC 14, can’t exactly remember though. Wasn’t it harmonic minor? Or was that 15?</p>
