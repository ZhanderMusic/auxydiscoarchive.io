    <title>Need help with drop, [Future Bass]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/need-help-with-drop-future-bass/13300</link>
    <description>I took this from one of my projects and compiled the drop, the drop on the song this was originally on didn’t go well transitioning, so I’m using it as a 2nd drop, but for now I need to work on the first one, and I can’t think of any way to make it. I’m looking for either a transition 8-4 bar or a instantaneous Drop. I didn’t want to include the full project because it’s a mess.
