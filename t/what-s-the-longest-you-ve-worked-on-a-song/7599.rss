    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-s-the-longest-you-ve-worked-on-a-song/7599</link>
    <description>I’ve working on a song for an entire month 
And I pretty much hate The way it sounds now XD. What’s the longest one you’ve worked on?
Also: I mean main songs-not side projects.</description>

            <p>This song is actually starting to get close to nearly 10 months in total of work as I decide to go and mix it fully in FL studio to make it high enough quality for full digital release (Spotify etc.) Although that can’t top a full year it’s certainly something I didn’t expect when I first wrote this song xD</p>

            <p>I doubt it was a release schedule problem more that my activity mostly consisted of reposts… or maybe they were bots or people who followed just for one track… im just rambling on, but I believe that i cant blame my release schedule, i just need to get better</p>

            <p>From what I can still remember it was my track Cyborg. I worked on that for about 1 month, mainly because I couldn’t finish it quickly due to my busy schedule. By the time I was able to finish and upload it, I didn’t even like it anymore.<br>
That’s one flaw of mine; the longer I work on tracks, the less I like them…</p>

            <p>I can’t really estimate the span of days I work on a song, sometimes it’s various.</p>
<p>But I definitely spend about 18-22 hours on each track. So approx. 3-4 weeks. On bigger tracks or collaborations, I spend more hours/days</p>
