    <title>Doppler 3 - Artichoke [WIP, dubsteppish, project, Needs completion]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/doppler-3-artichoke-wip-dubsteppish-project-needs-completion/8071</link>
    <description>I’m not good enough to finish what I’ve started; starting it alone, and getting this far, is something I’m very proud of. If you’ve made music on Auxy that sounds better than Doppler 3, then this is specifically for you. Otherwise, just shorten the project to after the first drop, and remix it however you like.

The only rule is that, no matter how it turns out, you share it with me, if not publicly then over PM. I simply must hear what else this can sound like!</description>
