    <title>A note about feature requests</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-note-about-feature-requests/991</link>
    <description>Thanks for all the feedback we get! We really appreciate it. It shows how much you care about making the app better. Just like we do.

Quick reminder though that we&#39;re only two people working full time on Auxy, and this forces us to be super picky about choosing what we spend our time on.

We would love to add more beta testers, ship more sound packs, add support for different time signatures, build user accounts, allow collaboration in the app, build an Android version, and all other great things that people are asking for. It&#39;s just that all these things take a lot of time and we cannot do them all at once.

In some cases there are outside things preventing us from moving forward with something that we would love to invest in as well. Especially when making sound packs, which are usually dependent on outside collaborators. I.e. we cannot call Skrillex and get him to send a pack next week, even if that would be awesome.

So trust that we&#39;re doing our best to prioritize what we believe is important based on your feedback. We read every piece of feedback, even though we don&#39;t have time to answer or implement things right away.

Thanks for supporting!</description>

            <p>Find a way to make more money so you can hire more developers, and pay someone to deal with us <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> … I don’t know the statistics so I don’t even know if money is the reason the company is so small. I don’t mind paying 5 dollars for sound packs, but paying money to buy credits you can spend on whole packs or single instruments might be cool too. You could further expand that to a subscription which gives you an allowance of credits, like Splice. Maybe invest some money into advertising on youtube or something so you can get some more people spending money on your app as well.</p>
