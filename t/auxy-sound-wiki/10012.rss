    <title>Auxy Sound Wiki</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-sound-wiki/10012</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome to the Auxy sound wiki, a quick easy-to-use reference guide for the sounds, their controls, and prominent tracks that utilize the sounds. This will (in theory) be open to anyone to edit (if this wiki thing works). Thanks to MisterMaster for giving me permission to create this for the improvement of the community. Please feel free to edit any details, especially adding in styles that the sounds best fit into, as well as tracks that make excellent use of a given sound.

----

This wiki will be divided into three sections, each with a collapsible interface that allows for easy reference of sounds. Unfortunately there is no easy/feasible way to indent through Discourse, so please bear the formatting quirks. It&#39;s also going to be a bit of jargon too, so bear with any unfamiliar terminology or confusing descriptions.

Any unique behavior of macros such as delay and reverb will be noted, otherwise most instruments act very similar with these macros and functionality is (mostly) the same.

A NOTE ON ADDING TRACKS IN - Please do not add any tracks in that only have a tiny bit of the sound in question, or are just your own songs and you&#39;re trying to promote yourself. The purpose of this is to show outstanding usage of a given instrument. An example of this would be the use of Beam found in Crimson by Blackocean, or the use of  Bow found in Coup by Phluze. Priority should be also given to any track featured in the feed, to give more examples as to how the sounds were used. This is not for promotion. Be on an honor system when it comes to these things. If there&#39;s any issue, it will be taken up with the moderators. 

**IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THIS ISN&#39;T JUST BEING USED FOR PROMOTION, DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN SONGS IN AS EXAMPLES. SOMEONE ELSE MUST RECOMMEND/EDIT THEM IN**
---
Thank you for following the above rule.

**IF ANYONE CHANGES ANYTHING ABOVE THE DOUBLE LINE OTHER THAN MODERATORS OR ME (TheRealJFalc) IT WILL BE REMOVED. [spoiler]I LIKE MY WORDING AS IT IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH[/spoiler]**

# Bass Sounds

[details=Barber]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | AP-004 RAC Essentials |
| Waveform | Saw x Sine with attack, fades into a sine wave. | 
| Details | One of the free bases, this is one of the more prominently used basses from AP-004. It has a distinctive analog sound, and the attack on the front of each note is useful for styles of music | 
| Macro: Tone | Applies a clip distortion to the waveform. The distortion is stronger when layered with other notes |
| Macro: Shape | Adjusts the release (R\) of the waveform |
| Styles useful | All-around sound |
| Featured Tracks | [Aqua - Curve](https://soundcloud.com/aquax/curve) | 
[/details]

[details=Beam]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | (AP-009) Destiny |
| Waveform | Cross between a rounded triangle mixed with a cross-breed distorted sine and square wave. It also features a slight pitch bend on the attack of the note, making a sharp hit. | 
| Details | A very heavy bass from 7 Skies, this one can be awkward to use, but is great for very heavy sounding beats and drops. | 
| Macro: Tone | Adds clipping distortion to the waveform |
| Macro: Shape | Increases the attack (A) of the waveform by a small factor. This seems to play a use in softening the attack of the note achieved by the pitch bend. |
| Styles useful | Heavy baselines, such as trap and dubstep. |
| Featured Tracks | [Blackocean - Crimson](https://soundcloud.com/blckocean/crimson-1)| 
[/details]

[details=Bee]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Saw with attack, high resonance and clipping distortion. | 
| Details | One of the original sounds, bee is a solid saw-based bass that has some interesting features attached to shape and tone, specifically with how the resonance functions. | 
| Macro: Tone | Increases the resonance of the waveform, creating a vox-like effect |
| Macro: Shape | Adjusts the Sustain (S) of the attack. No shape removes most of the attack-like effect from the instrument, while full gives the full impact of the attack and sustains it out.
| Macro: Lowpass | Controls the amount of resonance as well as the lowpass filter on the waveform. Having it at the lowest values removes most of the resonance from the instrument | 
| Styles useful | House, Trance |
| Featured Tracks | [ADD] |

# Lead Sounds

[details=Autumn]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Triangle with chorus and slight bitcrush distortion. |
| Details | One of the OG sounds, Autumn is a solid triangle wave pluck that has a filter attached to an ADSR envelope that helps to create a slight plucking sound from the instrument. |
| Macro: Tone | Adds a second triangle wave to the waveform at a perfect fifth above the note. |
| Macro: Shape | Increases the decay (D) of the ADSR envelope controlling part of the filter |
| Styles useful | All-around instrument |
| Featured Tracks | [ADD] |
[/details]

[details=Bow]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Saw wave with resonance and pitch bend controlled by a LFO |
| Details | One of the OG sounds, Bow is a very useful sound when used in the right way. Without any shape, it can function as a pluck, and with full shape it becomes a strong string-like synth with a slight pitch vibrato. Some people struggle to use it, but when used effectively it creates a very solid sound that grabs the attention of the listener. |
| Macro: Tone | Adds a phaser to the instrument |
| Macro: Shape | Adjusts the Attack, decay and sustain of the waveform (ADS). No shape creates a pluck effect, while full shape adds full sustain to the instrument and creates a very strong lead sound. |
| Styles useful | All-around sound when used properly |
| Featured Tracks | [Coup by Phluze](https://soundcloud.com/phluze/coup), [Kleuren by Conux](https://soundcloud.com/conux_official/kleuren) |

[details=Bumble] 
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Sine x Pulse waveform with low sustain, an envelope controlling the filter as well as an LFO controlling the rate of the pulse wave. | 
| Details | Bumble is a weird lead that lends itself best to heavier types of sound. At its core, it is a sine wave and pulse wave driven sound, but its main functionality works with how it is ranged in the lower octaves, which sets it apart from the other leads. The filter is overdriven, creating a strong sound that resonates through the lower octaves, making it a great choice for heavy-styled songs. | 
| Macro: Tone | Adds a strong clip-based distortion to the waveform | 
| Macro: Shape | Adds release to the ADSR envelope controlling the waveform. |
| Styles useful | Heavy stuff |
| Featured Tracks | [IVO - Civil Disobedience](https://soundcloud.com/official_ivo/civil-disobedience) | 
[/details]

[details=Canoe]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Sine wave with massive FM and detune, sounds similar to an electric organ | 
| Details | One of the original sounds, Canoe is an electric-organ like sound that functions off detuning sine waves. Caution should be used, however, as Canoe is known to strongly clip. | 
| Macro: Tone | Boosts the drive of the filter, creating a distortion to the waveform. This can cause the sound to clip. | 
| Macro: Shape | Detunes the oscilators and increases the ADSR release of the waveform |
| Styles useful | General purpose |

[details=Castle]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Square waveform that switches to a strong detuned saw when the tone macro is applied, along with an ADSR envelope attached to the filter. | 
| Details | As one of the original sounds, Castle is very strange in its uses. Without tone, it acts like a slightly filtered square wave with a slight envelope controlling the filter. With tone, Castle is turned into a very strong detuned saw wave, creating a very distinct sound that works well as a riser. | 
| Macro: Tone | Fades the square wave into a heavily detuned saw wave | 
| Macro: Shape | Increases the decay on the envelope controlling the filter |
| Styles useful | General purpose, risers |

[details=Cinema]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Strange sine-like waveform with chorus that adjusts with Tone | 
| Details | As one of the original sounds, Cinema is quite a strange sound. With tone adjusting the position of the sound on a wavetable, it&#39;s really hard to nail exactly what it is supposed to sound like. It is a strong sound, however, with a deep chorus effect. | 
| Macro: Tone | Changes the position of the wavetable | 
| Macro: Shape | Adds release to the ADSR envelope controlling the waveform |
| Styles useful | Synthwave(?) |

| Waveform | Heavily distorted sine and triangle-like waveform that resonates almost like a gong being hit, very difficult to describe. | 
| Details | One of the leads introduced in the Standard Deviation pack, Clever is one of the weirdest sounds to date. It works similarly to Coin from The Sound Of Vivrant, in that it almost sounds and functions like a percussion instrument. | 
| Macro: Tone | Adds a strong chorus effect to the waveform | 
| Macro: Shape | Adds ADSR Release to the waveform |
| Styles useful | Ambient textures |
| Featured Tracks | Words go here | 
[/details]

| Details | A personal favorite of the OG Sounds, Circle is a very distinct triangle waveform that functions simply and effectvively.  | 
| Macro: Tone | Adds noise to the waveform | 
| Macro: Shape | Adds release to the ADSR envelope controlling the waveform |
| Styles useful | General purpose, simplistic |
| Featured Tracks | [James Lucien - Re/Fragmented](https://soundcloud.com/james-lucien-official/refragmented) | 
[/details]

[details=Cone]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | Disturbing Leads |
| Waveform | Distorted Triangle-like waveform that becomes more distorted the longer the wave is sustained, the length of the time to distort can be changed through the Shape macro knob | 
| Details | One of the disturbing leads from the most recent pack, Cone is a strong triangle-esque sound with distortion that really gives a strong attack-like sound when used. Perfect for stab-like melodies. | 
| Macro: Tone | Detunes the waveform. No tone has the sound playing in unison, full tone has it detuned amongst three voices | 
| Macro: Shape | Adjusts the decay (D) of the ADSR-envelope controlling the waveform. More shape causes the distortion of the waveform to take longer. |
| Styles useful | Heavy and dark styles such as Trap |
| Featured Tracks | [ADD] | 
[/details]

[details=Corn]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | OG Sounds |
| Waveform | Pulse x Saw with low sustain and decay on the waveform as well as the filter. It also has a LFO modulating the pulse tuning as well as a phaser | 
| Details | One of the OG Sounds, Corn is traditionally used as a pluck sound for its short sustain and decay. | 
| Macro: Tone | Increases the decay, sustain and release of the ADSR envelope controlling the waveform. | 
| Macro: Shape | Increases the attack of the envelope controlling the filter |
| Styles useful | Plucks, house |

[/details]

[details=Crook]
| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| Pack | Disturbing Leads |
| Waveform | Saw and Sine waveform that is modulated by a strange saw-like form through an ADSR envelope and has resonance and clipping distortion  |
| Details | One of the disturbing leads, this instrument has a low sustain (S) value, meaning that longer notes get softer, making it much more of a pluck than other instruments. Adjusting the shape changes the way the ADSR envelope controls, and in practice that sustains the note out longer |
| Macro: Tone | Reduces the resonance of the filter, removing some of the effects on the instrument. |
| Macro: Shape | Increases the Decay (D) ofthe ADSR envelope controlling the strange saw-like waveform layering on top of the instrument. Full shape creates a strong effect on the instrument |
| Styles useful | Heavy and dark styles such as Trap |

            <p>I’ve considered it, but I don’t have much time nor incentive to do so. Not to mention that I don’t have any official contact with the devs or endorsement of such a thing, so at best it will be only maintained semi-regularly or hardly at all. Maybe in the future I will, but right now I have other things on my plate that don’t concern with Auxy as much.</p>

            <p>If you record the instrument yeah you can use Audacity or something. I usually just go by trying to match character and stuff as that’s a bit easier to do.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I will to check Standalonemusic out when I get the chance. Also, I’m assuming you can put the instruments through any waveform analyzer such Audacity too? Or does serum have different capabilities?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Auxy licenses them from various artists and locations, usually in the form of artist packs. Some of the other ones are developed in house by Auxy, or at least appear to be so.</p>
<p>As for analyzing waveform, I took basic guesses at it using Serum and ear, which probably accounts for many inaccuracies in reporting it. A lot of the artist packs are samples, so recreating them using Serum is nigh impossible. However, one thing to note is that 7 Skies does sell both The Future and Destiny through Standalonemusic, which I’ve linked numerous times. RAC’s pack was stated to be recorded off of vintage Roland equipment in both his interview video and the previous version’s description of his pack, so that’s a starting point for some of these. And Jeremy Orlander, the author of The Sound of Vivrant, is known to use Logic so it’s most likely he developed his presets using that. As for the recent artist packs, little is known of their compositional style or sources.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately the only extent I can detail my work here, as it’s a lot of guesswork and estimation.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Disco has a hard limit on how long a post can be, and I ran out of room on this. Not to mention I finally have a job that isn’t fast food now, so my time to work on this isn’t as much as it used to be. That among other things really pulled the rug out from under me when it comes to this. I may invest some time in the future, but as for the current point in time I don’t have many plans aside from possibly giving some one-off descriptions of instruments.</p>

Also, I don’t have a clue where Auxy gets their instrument patches, can someone tell me where I could find that information? And possibly how to analyze their waveforms?</p>

            <p>Alright everyone. Already talked to Arimyth and figuring out what data he exactly needs to set up a github page and stuff. Should be happening in the next couple of days or so.</p>
<p>In the interim, I can do sound requests on an individual basis in replies as I feel that would help more pressing sounds be more easily identifiable (I have a preference of what sounds I’d rather cover first, so some sounds that others want will take longer, etc.)</p>
