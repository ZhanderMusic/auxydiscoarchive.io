    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/music-promotion-for-all-skilled-artists/20268</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! you may know of a big record label called NCS (No copyright sounds)

I have just created a new channel with the same intentions NCS have, but with mobile music. If you would like to be on the channel (yes its not much now but I believe we can grow it to help a lot of Artists out) if your interested, go sub here and ill add submission details once ive uploaded the first song.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHEqEXrzHx6vELo4VA03akQ?view_as=subscriber

keep in mind it will only be mobile made music posted.

I am hoping to grow this to good size community where all types of mobile artists can have a chance at getting there music heard. I would really appreciate it if as much of you as you can sub to go ahead and get this channel started at reaching out into the YouTube community. I will also later on in the future be putting it onto Spotify, Apple Music etc... for free with artists consent. PLS consider this and thank you!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To add to Arimyth’s excellently put post…</p>
<p>Consider reaching out to online music producers and influencers who appear to be mobile/tablet-based.</p>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjOdcJbnQcVjH_o4j2AbLog">Henny Tha Bizness</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Additional options might be sample pack companies — including those who already have packs available in Auxy, e.g. Black Octopus, Samples from Mars, etc… — i.e. companies with products that can already work in a mobile workflow.</p>
<p>They may be wiling to support you with a Tweet/RT or IG post, or a mention on their other channels.</p>
<p>Even if not, they might be able to help give some input on how best to promote and build your channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
One thing to bear in mind is that, if you’re aiming at <em>all</em> mobile music production, don’t limit yourself to just Auxy producers — though reaching out to the the ‘higher profile’ Auxy creators is possibly a good way to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Go for quality early, as this will attract more repeat visitors.<br>
Better to have higher quality and less frequent posting to start, as people will still sub to a quality channel even if they don’t post often.</p>
<p>Then, once you’ve got access to sources of quality mobile tracks, start increasing the frequency of new posts.</p>
<p>…and, be sure to package new YT posts will pre-announcement posts and ‘go live’ posts on Twitter, IG, etc…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Tbh, I’d consider ditching the ‘copyright free’ part of the proposition, as that’s likely to limit the quality of early submissions while your channel doesn’t yet give submissions access to large audience/exposure.</p>
<p>I’d focus on the mobile part of the proposition. You could always create a channel sub-playlist for those submissions which are ok with being Copyright Free.)</p>

            <p>I’d like to point out something briefly that I don’t want to slip through the cracks amidst all the back and forth here.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="ThoughtfulNoise" data-post="14" data-topic="20268">
<div class="title">

<blockquote>
<p>As I’ve mentioned before, the ‘mobile only’ music proposition is interesting, and something which Auxy themselves have failed to really promote on. There’s been a little buzz around the topic for years, but it’s worth finding out which online music and tech publications might be interested in hearing about what you’re trying to do.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is what I consider to be the real selling point of your promotional channel project. Amidst the thousands of music promotional channels out there including some of the more notable names like NCS, an exclusively mobile music promo channel has the potential to stand out and really break new ground as its promoting not only a certain style(s) of music but also a criminally underused form of technology within the music industry, and subsequently an entire user base around that.</p>
<p>While I understand the limitations and constraints you’re under as a younger student with limited access to social media, this kind of outreach requires nothing more than an email address and a web browser at a bare minimum. Find blogs and online publications that are pushing mobile music and introduce yourself, find out how you may be able to mutually assist each other in the growth of your online endeavors. Mobile music is still a relatively undervalued and small sector of the music industry and so your chances of striking a solid connection with at least one existing influencer in this space is reasonably high.</p>
<p>To put it simply, I think that when you start a project that is at least partially responsible for the success and growth of others beyond yourself, there’s a level of obligation that you should feel to do whatever possible to make that project successful and consequently those invested in the project successful (within reason) as well. And I think understanding how little time some of these steps can or need to take is key so that it doesn’t seem like you’re undertaking an inordinately huge amount of tasks on top of what sounds to be an already busy lifestyle.</p>

            <p>I agree. However…</p>
<p>Perhaps the OP would benefit from some (firm) nudging to shape up their offer, by getting their actions more aligned with their aspirations.</p>
<p>Rather than blaming the lack of promotion effort on the low uptake of the offer, do the preparation and planing needed to add clearer promotional value to those who submit (including getting the social channels sorted and ready) because <em>that’s</em> how you attract submissions.</p>
<p>If it had been pitched as a bit of fun (or was more transparent about the social channels situation), fine. But the OP has set their goals higher than that. Which is great.</p>
<p>I wish the OP well. It’s commendable that someone so young is taking some initiative and trying something. (Fwiw, I’m one of the 17 subs the MMN YT channel has. I subbed straight away to support them.)</p>
<p>But, to improve the likelihood of submissions there are some things that a new promo channel could and, yes, <em>should</em> be doing ahead of time — and every time a new submission comes in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
But…</p>

            <p>Can we not use imperative and ask anyone or anything, also can we guys stop being passive-aggressive? it gets annoying for not only me, but for people who read this. I’m being neutral here and I’m not siding with anyone. MMN is just simply made to put some works here to shine in spotlight for a while, which would give some artists to be motivated to do more, and for people to enjoy it.<br>
That’s all.</p>

            <p>First off, you don’t know or understand my situation. So really man, I ask kindly for you to back down <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . I don’t have twitter, nor want or care about it. Yes there is a sc and I promote the channel and sc on discord servers etc…now my parents don’t let me have instagram on my phone only on my iPad which is lost which is the only reason why I haven’t created a insta. I can’t even post on mine until I find it. Don’t jump to things when you don’t understand the situation alright? This is a fun thing im doing to help out other artists so don’t make it seem like it should be a huge hardcore hit that everyone is going to know about. First off im promoting unprofessional music which makes it hard enough. Because most mobile music just isn’t up there with other artists. Im taking time out of my long days at school and homework to creat logos and art work and music videos and research good tags  so take that into consideration. junior year is tough. I work construction on top of that, I got a life. And if you know so much about promo stuff, why do you only got 23 followers. Im doing everything I physically can right now so until I have the resources I need don’t expect much more. Right now its just some fun giving some artists a bit of exposure and a fun music video of there song. Just showing people I care. maybe you can enjoy it too if you rant criticizing people <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Not trying to get at you, but Twitter and IG take a couple mins to set up and seconds to post.</p>
<p>In the time it took you to respond here and bump the call for submissions, you could have (should have) posted both tracks to Twitter and IG, at least. It certainly doesn’t take 22 days.</p>
<p>Are you tagging the YouTube videos to maximise their chances of being discovered?<br>
Are you researching what the right tags would be for when you post to YT, Twitter, IG, etc…?</p>
<p>Is there an official MMN SoundCloud channel that you’re also reposting on?</p>
<p>Have you promoted it elsewhere, on other music forums, or on your personal Twitter and IG accounts?</p>
<p>I think what you’re trying to do is cool, but you need to be more on top of things if you really want the project to succeed.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned before, the ‘mobile only’ music proposition is interesting, and something which Auxy themselves have failed to really promote on. There’s been a little buzz around the topic for years, but it’s worth finding out which online music and tech publications might be interested in hearing about what you’re trying to do.</p>
<p>Consider Following some on Twitter, keeping an eye on their Tweets and then responding with a little promo when the right topic comes up. Or, just @ them with a fresh promo.</p>
<p>The more pro-active you are, the more you can point to the value you can bring to those who want to get their music out there, and the more enticing your offer is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I recommend subbing to content sources about music/artist promotion, to start getting up to speed on the kinds of promotion activities you could/should be doing for your MMN channels - <em>plural</em>.</p>
<p>The Spotify for Artists and Landr blogs are great. YT channels like Damian Keyes are also worth checking out.</p>
<p>Have fun with it, but be pro-active.</p>
<p>There are also loads of great tips pinned in this category on the forum, including this post…</p>

Anyone here can add a post, for any genre.

<p>But, even so…</p>
<p>Do those sharing their music via your channel actually understand that, by doing so, they’re effectively promoting/declaring their music as ‘copyright-free’ — i.e. relinquishing copyright rights over their music?</p>
<p>I imagine that’s likely to be a deal-breaker for many/most.</p>
<p>Why ‘copyright free’? Why not simply ‘royalty free’?</p>
