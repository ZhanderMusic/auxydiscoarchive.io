            <p>Yeah the lack of scales really killed it for me.  But while we’re on the subject of other apps, anyone use ikaossilator?  Shamelessly cheesy sounds, but damn if it isn’t always a fun time.</p>

            <p>I used medly a while back. I (at the time) thought it had extremely high quality. I had bought the band pack, and had even copied over melodies from the Auxy iPad app. I thought my tracks were good (they weren’t) and then I started using auxy more. Then I had to delete the app because it wouldn’t update (Apple ID issues). In all, I’m not a fan of medly (only pentatonic and chromatic scales? Please.), but I would recommend it for people whose devices won’t support Auxy, because it’s a great place for ideas which you can eventually transfer over to auxy.</p>

            <p>It sounds nice! I prefer Auxy, but i’m sure some people really enjoy Medly so good for them. Whatever gets people into music/creativity! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/3.png?v=5" title=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t3:"></p>

            <p>I heard that the Medley devs are planning on putting in a keyboard you can actually play the sounds live with.  So that will be a selling point over Auxy.  I know know, it’s just SO much more fun and expressive to place squares on a grid but hey it’s something</p>
