    <description>[Heathen AKA - (as yet untitled)](https://soundcloud.com/heathenaka/h-aka-s-03-slow-dark-synthwave/s-uz71w) [IDM, dark, wonky, melodic]

Been sitting on this one and haven&#39;t touched it for the past two or three months.
I want to resume working on it, but wanted to get some feedback/input from y&#39;all first.

It&#39;s currently only 2m39s, so it&#39;s probably not at its final/full duration.

&amp;nbsp;
So, anyway, thoughts and comments welcome.

&amp;nbsp;
P.S. Yes, the bass is distorting in parts. It&#39;s on the list of things to fix.</description>

<p>It’s little more than a draft at the moment, so it’s possibly a case of cramming the ideas in ahead of proper development. So, your input is helpful as I’m a little too familiar with it.</p>
<p>It’s likely that I can thin it out as part of the lengthening process.</p>
<p>Thanks. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>I’m a fan of anything dark/synthwave/IDM so I thought there was quite a bit to like here.</p>
<p>If you’re after constructive feedback, I felt too many of the elements were demanding my attention (most noticeably in the higher frequencies). Each had quite a bit of character and are mostly forward in the mix.</p>
<p>My favourite sections were at 1:09 and 1:26 (the most stripped back parts), so maybe a sparser arrangement, or pushing a few things back in the mix, may work?</p>
<p>Food for thought, anyway… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
