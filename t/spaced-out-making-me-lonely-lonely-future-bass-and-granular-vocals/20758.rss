    <title>Spaced out - making me lonely,lonely( future bass and granular vocals)</title>

    <description>Hi everyone that is reading this . I just wanted to inform you about how this song was made. I started in koala sampler looping the sample and stretch the sample to make sure it would fit 4 bars 100 bpm, so I could export it and get perfectly timed samples . I just wanted to state that koala sampler is great for samples and sound exploration and Auxy is great for sequencing , arranging and mixing , these two apps go very well together.

            <p>Koala sampler is quite good, the Samurai IAP right? The gift that keeps on giving… neat track it’s a bit busy for my tastes but can appreciate what’s gone into it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
