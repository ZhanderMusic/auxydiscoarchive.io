    <title>Where has the Auxy team gone?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-has-the-auxy-team-gone/11466</link>
    <description>So I’ve noticed it’s been quite a while since any Auxy personnel have been on disco for a while, and they haven’t reposted for a long time, so I was just wondering if any of the mods knew about where they have gone.</description>

            <p>They come back around with major updates. Last I spoke to a dev, they were addressing a problem I had in the app and then they fixed the problem that I had. That’s all I need from them.</p>

            <p>I comepletly agree… the auxy community is very special- not many apps have ways to communicate with developers and other users alike. This should be preserved, not abused…<br>
People who can’t treat their peers in a community with respect and maturity should not be aloud into that community in the first place.</p>

            <p>According to his profile, Lenberg was last online on July 3rd, about a month ago…, but he last posted over a month before that, on May 24th. I heard something about Lenberg having a baby around March, and if that is so, then he should be prioritising his personal life, for obvious reasons. Let’s give the devs the time they need, and I’m sure they will return to the community soon enough…</p>

            <p>Of course it’s obvious they’ve been quite busy, yet, while most of the community is arguing about why it’s not right they just disappeared or that we should have gotten a heads up on their leave. Have you asked yourself if maybe the reason they’re so busy is because they’re focused on bringing something big for US? The community?</p>
<p>Let them be, support them on their leave, ensure they’re safe and once their back thank them. It’s been stated before that the community is full of toxicity. The immediate reaction of most of you proves that. Instead of thinking ahead, we point fingers and state the first thought that pops into our head.</p>
<p>We are, as stated, a <em>community</em>, not all communities get a long, but let us please try to keep this one together. Far too many out there are already falling apart.</p>

<p>I suppose I have a different viewpoint on this than other people. While that is ok, I still would prefer to know where my money is going into, and what exactly I’m going to be paying for in the future. I do not wish to be paying for things I could access elsewhere, and I feel like better communication would help to reassure me that my purchase is worthwhile. That is why I speak out about this. Perhaps not always in the best way, but as Akabil has mentioned before, this is the only way to get any sort of acknowledgement sometimes.</p>

            <p>Wow y’all, I am speechless after reading this thread. Get back to making music, inactive for a week? That’s nothing; what do you want from the guy?  To check in saying, hey auxy hope y’all are still making music with my app, no? All to concerned with where I am hiding out , it’s called a life people. Enough said</p>

<p>Thats a different thing, sony has the right to be silent about releases, it adds an element of surprise, Auxy does the same thing with sound packs.<span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-has-the-auxy-team-gone/11466/36">spoiler</a></span></p>
<p>And I get that only 2 people can struggle to report everything thats going on, but thats even more reason to tell us about the big things. You’d think that if he knew that he was going to go away fro <em>1+ months</em> and it wasn’t a short notice emergency he’d at least make a thread saying “I wont be working on the app for a little while i do this thing” don’t you?</p>

            <p>Large companies are often silent. Right now, I’m waiting for Sony (with 100,000+ employees) to confirm their PS+ releases for August.</p>
<p>It’s actually harder for a small company to be responsive, as a couple of people have to cover everything. They don’t have teams or staff to assign tasks to.</p>
<p>That said, Lenberg has been travelling - amongst other things - and will be back later in August.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I know some of those “bigger producers” left because of the toxicity they received from the second part of that statement.</p>

<p>That wasn’t entirely meant to be a toxic statement, and I apologize for that as I’ve already done.</p>

<p>He wouldn’t just abandon his source of income like this for no reason.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unless he moved to a different project where he could sustain his income properly. Having two kids certainly is something he’d need a stable job to maintain. Auxy isn’t exactly stable, as he’s shown with the movements to eliminate any free users from the app.</p>

</aside>
<p>A sign that he’s still committed to the project and hasn’t moved on to other things. A sense of purpose for which our money is going for. Advanced communication, less secrecy, more openness, those sorts of things. Everyone’s talked about them before, and I’m sure that you guys are feeling it as well. The desire of confirmation that he’s still committed to Auxy.</p>
