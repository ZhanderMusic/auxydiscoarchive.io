    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indir3ct-dawn-chill-electronic-wubs/6353</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! This will be my last track till the new update :stuck_out_tongue:
Here I worked on 6 note chords, and multiple melodies. I also recreated a high swing sound, but, the swing is at 0! A new discovery for me! I hope you enjoy it. And please, any feedback or comments would be awesome and much appreciated! Thanks!!

            <p>It does change, but is only really noticeable with 8th notes. Try making an arpeggio and turning up and down the swing setting.</p>

            <p>Nice! Also, you can write swing(swung, swinged, swanged?) 8th notes as a quarter note and an eighth note in triplet form. Do you understand what I am saying? I was just surprised as to how you didn’t know that you didn’t need the swing setting to make swing.<br>
