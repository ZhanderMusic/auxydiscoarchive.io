    <title>Jax - Untitled [WIP, Project, Chill] - Feedback?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/jax-untitled-wip-project-chill-feedback/17486</link>
    <description>Hey guys, here’s something I’ve been working on. Its in a genre I’ve never tried before so it’s not the best and any feedback is appreciated, wether that’s suggestions, tips on mixing/mastering, pointing out any mistakes I made, or just even your own personal opinion on where I should take it.

P.s. This is not open for collabs, this track is nearly finished, just need to find tune it and help it reach its full potential, thanks for the help!</description>
