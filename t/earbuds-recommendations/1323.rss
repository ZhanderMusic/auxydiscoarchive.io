    <description>In this post, I will review and also ask for earbuds.
If you guys know of any noise cancelling, comfortable, and good quality earbuds, let me know.

Now for the reviews.
- I got two Skullcandy Smokin Buds 2 earbuds and they were pretty okay. Greatest quality I ever had and is comfortable and noise cancelling but one of the earbuds stopprd working in a month. 
- I got a Jlabs Metal earbud pack last week and they were okay too. Sometimes they&#39;re a bit loose and one side of the earbuds was stuffy unless I adjusted it in my ear. The quality is good too and they are somewhat noise cancelling if you fit the earbuds in.
- I got the Jlabs Jbuds and expected something good. They werent really noise cancelling and they kinda hurt my ears when I tried to fit them in. The quality was okay.

I couldnt choose between metal or smokin buds 2 for the best</description>

I’ve never thought of overuse as a cause, but now that you mention it, this makes a lot of sense. Sorry for any confusion this may have caused.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is purely due to either the volume settings on your specific device or any wear and tear they’ve endured while you’ve owned them. Apple does not downgrade / throttle old hardware with the release of new hardware (besides the case of the 6/6s battery throttling), especially given that they haven’t actually pushed any new firmware to the Airpods which would render it impossible to intentionally modify their behavior at least through software.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/hum4n01d">@Hum4n01d</a> Personally, I use Airpods for music production if I’m not near my wired headset and find the audio quality to be decent and any latency to be negligible especially given the lack of a live recording interface.</p>

            <p>I don’t think apple would have downgraded the old pods since:</p>
<ol>
<li>It hasn’t been mentioned from others (at least I haven’t seen anything about it)</li>
<li>They’re comparable with the new case anyway and that’s mainly what’s new. The pods themselves haven’t really changed much.</li>
</ol>
<p>Could be just how much wear you have on your AirPods</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s workable, however, I’ve noticed the sound quality has significantly dropped since I’ve got them. Regular apple earbuds with wires have better quality then they do now. I think it’s part of apple downgrading it since the release of AirPods series 2. The main problem with it is that they seem to be really quiet compared to other earbuds; I’ll have my volume up to full and it still isn’t as loud as regular apple earbuds at half volume. Wouldn’t recommend them, but yes, it is workable.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m wrong, please read the next three posts.</p>

            <p>Yup I use AirPods. Works just fine. no noticeable latency problems.<br>
Only problem I’ve ever had is the battery, but that’s literally only if I’ve been using them all day. They charge hella quick tho (I believe 15mins = full charge)</p>

            <p>Seeing as how there isn’t a live playing surface I’m sure it’s fine.</p>
<p>As soon as you try to introduce a live playing surface, with any kind of bluetooth ear wear the latency ranges from garbage to unbearable.</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, does anybody use AirPods for Auxy? I’ve heard there’s some latency issues and I’m wondering if it’s workable?</p>

            <p>Not giving you heat, just giving you better options. Sennhieser headphone are usually good quality IF you hook it up to a mic/instrument interface like Scarlett 2i2</p>

            <p>I don’t like Beats quality at all. That would be the last hung I recommend because first off don’t get Beats just because it’s popular. Bose is more expensive but better quality. I recommend Sennhieser stuff not Beats. Sony may have some good products but I think Sennhieser would be better</p>

            <p>Speaking of Beats, I used to have the earlier Solo Beats.<br>
It turned out to be a fake one, because they broke easily. Just a tip for getting Beats: If they seem a little TOO delicate, they could possibly be fake.</p>

            <p>I %100 agree. I’ve bought two beats headphones in my life and they were both garbage, huge disappointment. my first pair were really tight so I could only where them for 20 minutes at a time. my other pair broke immediately when I threw them on my bed!?! I’m never going to buy them again. And for headphones if you want to make music you don’t want extra base. because you want to base it off of how every one else is listening to it. if you make music in a bass boosted head phone it will sound off when you listen to it in a really quality headphone set.</p>

            <p>I use <strong>sol republic shadow</strong>. they are <strong>$90</strong> and are <strong>amazing quality</strong>. yo can get them at best buy and I love them. I go running a lot, which is an issue with these earphones, because they fall off when you run with them really easily. but if this is for the purpose of making music I would get these.</p>

            <p>I hate to rip on your favorite company or whatever, but beats are actually quite cheap to make, and they boost the bass to the extreme so you think that it’s “high quality”. I’ve read multiple articles that dissect beats headphones and find that the actual sound equipment is worth about $17, and they sell for about $200. I STRONGLY advise not to get beats if you’re going for quality.</p>

</aside>
<p>I strongly disagree.</p>
<p>When producing music (and especially mixing) you want the best quality headphones/monitors you can afford.<br>
You should of course check how your final mix translates across a wide range of consumer products…</p>

            <p>Any skullcandys are perfect for a low budget. They are high quality and not expensive like beats.</p>

            <p>I recommend Beats urbeats they are designed to not tangle and have awesome bass and sound quality and you can store them any where and not break because the earbud is made of metal so the are more durable and when you need to go through airport security it won’t be a problem (i have been stopped for metal headphones before) lastly easy to store and comes with a silicone caring case</p>
