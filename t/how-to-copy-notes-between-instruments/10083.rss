    <title>How to copy notes between instruments?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-copy-notes-between-instruments/10083</link>
    <description>I have a feeling there’s an easy answer to this question, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. How do you copy the note data from a loop in one instrument and paste it into a new loop on another instrument, so you can get two instruments playing the same part without having to write it again a second time?

Duplicate only works within the same instrument, and the same for note copy and paste. Can anyone answer this?</description>

            <p>Thanks, that worked! For some reason I thought move function was only within the same instrument!</p>

            <p>Locate the instrument and the loop you would like to copy note data from.<br>
Tap and hold on the loop.<br>
Press <em>Duplicate</em>.<br>
You will have a copy of that loop on the same instrument. Drag the duplicated loop to a new instrument.</p>
