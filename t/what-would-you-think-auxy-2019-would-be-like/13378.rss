    <description>If you don‚Äôt, somebody will.

It‚Äôs almost 2019. You know the deal. Auxy 6, or Auxy 2019, will come out soon. Tell me, what is your thoughts on what is gonna be added in the next major update of Auxy. Or, if you think there would be no Auxy 2019, tell me why you think it wouldn‚Äôt exist.

What I‚Äôll think will be added is an option to add audio (Voices, Samples, etc.) in your projects and improve the automation system to be more advanced.[quote=&quot;stereofield, post:2, topic:13378&quot;]
Also, you‚Äôre a year late. Importing audio &amp;amp; samples has been here since Auxy 5 came out

            <p>they‚Äôre not bad, but not great.  Prob wouldn‚Äôt be my first option.</p>
<p>But i do realize we could prob just record through headphones or heck, there are attachment mics for phones that work too.</p>

            <p>Actually, iPhone‚Äôs microphones are really good, especially when recording video. My S8 has a really good microphone, especially since I have two to create binaural audio. Since Auxy is geared towards creators rather than sound engineers, using an iPhone‚Äôs two microphones is perfect for amateurs</p>

            <p>I hope this year the devs could update us on upcoming features. I don‚Äôt want another case where the devs tell us nothing about changes like what happened when Auxy 5 came out.</p>
<p>My wishlist for 2019 is more colors, better organisation, a more advanced UI for iPad models, a simpler UI for smaller screens like the 5S or SE, and 7 octaves.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Do agree that some changes that have been getting mentioned a lot have seemed to come up more recently. In other areas, not as much, but there‚Äôs been a cohesive direction in features that have been duly noted <em>and</em> appreciated.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd say whenever Auxy 6 would be around, it would have to provide true melodic sampling. That would be the major addition it would actually need to qualify such a huge step up in numbering. A rework to the way scenes are handled, such as allowing for x-numbered bars instead of even intervals, or even introducing the <span class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/what-would-you-think-auxy-2019-would-be-like/13378/6">spoiler</a></span> time signatures would be great as well. I‚Äôd even take just getting to set tempo based on scene.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm not 100% sure what I‚Äôm expecting but here are my hopes:</p>
<p>Time signatures<br>
‚ÄìPretty essential for film scoring and jazz, but would be useful in just about every genre.</p>
<p>Sound packs<br>
‚ÄìHoping for some Moog synths, vintage keys volume two, and jazz solo instruments.</p>
<p>Scales<br>
‚ÄìI would like to see some more scales. The modes should be options (Dorian, Phrygian, Locrian, Lydian, Mixolydian) and some of the Japanese scales like the Hiraj≈çshi scale. (To clarify, I know I can use any of these scales in Chromatic mode, but it would be a great convenience, especially for users who don‚Äôt know any theory.)</p>

            <p>I don‚Äôt think Auxy is operating on a schedule where they will release their major versions every year at the same time‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄúAuxy 6‚Äù would probably have to change at least something significant about the app to warrant a full major version change. Regardless of what the update is called, it seems like the devs have been taking user feedback into account pretty well recently, which is great. I‚Äôve been super satisfied with the 3 most recent melodic packs, and I like the direction the sounds seem to be going.</p>
