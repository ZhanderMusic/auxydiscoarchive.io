    <title>Auxy Radio Show!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-radio-show/11162</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Mr. Serpent here, and I&#39;m just letting y&#39;all know that I&#39;m planning on starting something up called the &#39;Auxy Radio Show&#39;!

Here&#39;s some stuff about it:

1. If you&#39;ve ever heard of auxcasts (something similar to this where we uploaded podcasts to soundcloud), this isn&#39;t gonna be like it. Podcasts in auxcasts were permanent, but this is gonna keep a sense of raw-ness and have vc discussions where people can listen in on the hosts talking about several topics relating to auxy and having an all-around good time just discussing stuff and playing little games. Your average radio show, stuffed in to discord and about a specific wonderful app :)

2. No hosts will be permanent. We&#39;ll likely have temporary hosts per week, and out of those selected for a week not every host has to participate in every VC. In order to become a host for a week, you have to fill out a form and coordinate what times you&#39;re able to get onto the VC. Check number 3 for further information regarding this.

3. We have yet to create a solid schedule, but as of now VCs are planned to be hosted at 14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. There&#39;s also an idea for nighttime VCs (for those night owls out there) hosted at 23:30 or 0:00 on Friday and Saturday nights, however this hasn&#39;t been set into stone.

TL;DR - The Auxy Radio Show is a place where you can sign up to host discord VCs that happen on select coordinated days of the week. If you&#39;re interested in hosting a specific block, dm me on the disco or send me a discord pm and we&#39;ll sort things out. Thanks for your support!

We&#39;ve already got quite a few people on the server, including Kro, SanaB, and aUstin Haga | &quot;Official.&quot; but we&#39;re open to anyone who cares to participate! More info will be in the discord server.
