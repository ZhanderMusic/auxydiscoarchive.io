    <description>@Auxy I challenge you to a beat the clock style contest. Make a 1 minute song with the sounds Bold, Silk, Lobster, Igloo, Charge, and Whack. You can have as many duplicates of each sound as you need. You may edit each sound as much as you choose. Beta features are allowed ;)

Upload the finished track to soundcloud and post the link here.
Anyone else who wants to compete, feel free to.

I call this..........yeah idk what to call it.</description>

            <p>Yeah I was curious. Does lenburg create the sound demos, obviously not the signature ones the artists would do that of the sounds. Who also created the sound packs from the older version because honestly I liked those demo songs more.</p>

            <p>He probably doesn’t have time when he is a developer of an app and are making plans to release a new version of Auxy soon. But, it would be cool to see him make some beats here and there.</p>
