    <title>The Auxy collab that involves EVERYONE 2</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/the-auxy-collab-that-involves-everyone-2/1410</link>
    <description>So, I was having a normal summer day, at my swimming class, when suddenly a pretty crazy idea struck me: An Auxy-wide megacollab where EVERYONE and anyone can join!
So here&#39;s how it goes:
1. Everyone chooses some type of vibe, like uplifting, sad, something like that
2. We all decide on the scale and BPM and swing and stuff like that. We&#39;re also limiting loops to 1 per person, just to keep things organized, and you can only have one active loop in a section
3. Then, the fun part: Everyone has a section of their own and must make their section resonate with the song, cause we want the song to sound and flow smoothly. Everyone&#39;s section must be a minimum of 4 bars to a maximum of 12. We&#39;ll be taking turns making our part, so when you&#39;re done, remember to share the project with your part and paste the link here on this topic, letting us know that you&#39;re done and the next Auxy musician will get their turn, and so on, until everyone is has had their part finished! Don&#39;t forget to name your section But don&#39;t worry too much about these rules, the collab is meant for everyone to have fun! 
4. Don&#39;t worry about the name of the song, we&#39;ll come up with some and vote on them!

If you guys wanna join, just say so below! Or if we should discuss this furthermore, we should do that just before we even begin, so that everything works well!

(P.S, is we do successfully manage to organize it, we&#39;ll give @Auxy and the Auxy team the honour of making to intro of the song!)</description>

            <p>Iâ€™m super late to this post.</p>
<p>But, if we were eligible to do so, it would we confusing. Think about it. There are atleast 100 or 1000 people here. That means atleast 100 or 1000 people would be working on this single project. That would then make everyone work on either one instrument or one note of an instrument. That would be hard to actually accomplish, but itâ€™s a challenge, so I donâ€™t mind if we do it.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s how to logically correct someoneâ€™s challenge. Sorry.</p>
