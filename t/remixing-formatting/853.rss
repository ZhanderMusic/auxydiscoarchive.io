    <title>Remixing formatting</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/remixing-formatting/853</link>
    <description>I have seen more than one Auxy user grab projects from the feed, &quot;remix&quot; them (usually not adding much) and then renaming them and passing them off as an original track. This is not treating the original artist(s) fairly, because they did most, if not all, work in the track. 

When remixing a track, here&#39;s my tips:

1. Change enough things that it still sounds somewhat like the original version, but has your style in it.
2. PM the original artist and ask if there is art that they would like you to use.
3. Format your title like this: **ENDM - Drift (Viiitality Remix)**
4. If possible, link to the original artists SoundCloud like this: @endm-usa
5. If the original song is from the feed, go ahead and post your mix. If not, send a private link to the original artist and make sure they like it before making your track public.

Also please note that if you are taking _certain elements_ from someone else&#39;s track but not actually remixing it, link to their page and say that they inspired you or that you &quot;sampled&quot; their track.

Thanks for keeping your songs legal, and I&#39;m sure that the original artists will thank you.</description>

            <p>So who wrote that very first 2 bar arp pattern in Drift? Because that’s all I want to use. First instrument, first pattern. Glad you posted I couldn’t remember where I got it.</p>
