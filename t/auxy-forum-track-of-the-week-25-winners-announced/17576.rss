    <title>Auxy Forum - Track of the Week #25 - Winners announced</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-25-winners-announced/17576</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

&lt;Big&gt; **This is the final Track of the Week competition for 2019!!!**&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;Small&gt; ...and this time it&#39;s a bit longer than a week  &lt;/small&gt;

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* :icsleepers: ICSleepers 
* :arimyth: Arimyth
* :azureonyx: AzureOnyx
* :goxenar:  Goxenar
* :blakkaz: Blakaz
* :dadmother: DadMother
* :janitor: MisterMaster

Judge this week is: @MisterMaster    

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p><big> <strong>Who is the ‚ì¶inner?</strong> </big></p>
<p>The overall quality of submissions was high so it‚Äôs been difficult to judge. There were no duds entered, with everyone putting up a decent track. So congrats to you all. You all did great.</p>
<p>But we have to choose winners, so here goes‚Ä¶ congrats to: -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/octave">@Octave</a> - for the feel-good old-school vibes</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/kheeshkp">@kheeshKP</a> - for the production quality.</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/azureonyx">@AzureOnyx</a> - for the musical complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt narrow it down more than this!</p>

<p>I check in with the judging pool periodically to see if they‚Äôre happy to keep judging Track of the Week.  So I‚Äôll do that next year to see if this weekly challenge continues. We‚Äôve done 25 weeks so far, which is about half a year.</p>
