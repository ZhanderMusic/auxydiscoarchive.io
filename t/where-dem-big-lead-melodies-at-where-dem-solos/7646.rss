    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-dem-big-lead-melodies-at-where-dem-solos/7646</link>
    <description>Now, I love me a big lead melody and a bit of a lead solo.

So, …

&amp;nbsp;
Post SC/YT links to one or two of your tracks with the strongest lead melody – or solo, if you have any.

Any genre.</description>

            <p>Absolutely. My goal has always been to create “instrumental” tracks that sort of stand on their own as songs due to the melodies that hopefully people are able to follow and hum along to.  The idea is to get people singing the sounds “bloop da be doo, bum bum bum”, etc lol</p>

<p>Thanks. I’m trying not to simply use my own stuff as examples of what I’m getting at.</p>
<p>My own melodies might not be the most fantastic (though I think they’re pretty hot [ <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ] and still find them quite hooky, even though I wrote 'em), but as you say, there’s little question that I use melodies quite prominently, in most of my stuff.</p>
<p>To put it in really basic terms, I appreciate melodies that make me wanna sing/whistle/hum along – or that I’ll be whistling for the next couple of days.</p>

            <p>Thank you! Glad you enjoyed.  I would’ve loved to do a big proper production of walkie Talkie but it just so happened to be born within the very limited iKaossilator app and for me there comes a point where a piece just is what it is, even if you try to make it better it’s just not the same song anymore.  Really enjoy your tracks as well, strong melodies for sure.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t say that the lead melody in Walkie Talkie is big and exuberant, but I do think the track is the best example yet of what I’m getting at. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think it helps that the track is kinda structured like a song, with clear sections, each with their own key melody. You return to some like a chorus and that makes the track move along nicely.</p>
<p>Because of that '70s funky bass sound (love it), and because melody was more of a thing, I couldn’t help but hope there was going to be a breakdown, with a funky af bass solo, ahead of the last ‘chorus’ (the bit that first appears at 1:20).</p>

<p>I understand what you’re saying here.<br>
I think I’ve become accustomed to working effectively in Auxy, either devising melodies outside and quickly sequencing them, or exploring directly in Auxy.</p>
<p>Either way, I think my solos and leads come off quite well – which is to say that I think it’s possible to sequence convincing melodies in Auxy. (Given my playing ability isn’t hot, I don’t see Auxy sequencing as a limitation.)</p>

            <p>Well my melodies are a defining characteristic and all but most of my best ones don’t come from Auxy as I do my best melody work when I am able to improvise live and then tweak a bit.  I can program some decent ones in a piano roll but that’s a compromise.    Check out “walkie Talkie” on my SoundCloud for some big exuberant melodies</p>

<p>Good use of under-melodies and counter-melodies.<br>
Additionally, the main melody felt like it was serving more as a rhythmic texture, rather than a free-roaming lead melody. Add to that, the Corner &gt; organ-y sound made the most prominent melody a little more recessive/modest.</p>
<p>I think it all worked well together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not possible as of yet to have multiple syncopations within Auxy</p>

<p>There’s a fair amount of wiggle room if you use a modest swing setting, and then mix in 1/12, 1/16, 1/24 and 1/32 quantisations. Add the Offset to that (for drums and samples, including tonal samples) and you’re not stuck to one swing feel.</p>

<p>Yeah, over-syncopation is probably my downfall when writing, so I’ll work on that. Thanks for pointing it out.</p>
<p>Sorry to be a pain, but could you elaborate on what you meant by texturing in your original reply? Not because I want that sweet, sweet, positive feedback in my ear <small>(ok maybe)</small>, but it would help to know what I was doing well in your opinion so that I can continue doing it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>Edit: Although ducker is a parameter that can be changed within each instrument, It’s not possible as of yet to have multiple syncopations within Auxy. It would be a great feature to add, however, along with tempo automation, individual note velocities, unorthodox time signatures and unsnapping notes on the grid. iirc, Ableton already has a system in which syncopations can be individualised for each track, which would be very handy indeed.</p>

</aside>
<p>But, with swing at 10, <em>imo</em>, you’ve gone straight pass ‘funky’ and entered ‘jaunty and fun’ territory, losing any ‘cool factor’.</p>
<p>If you’re rolling with high levels of syncopation, then it’s also better to layer it with elements that are less syncopated. If it’s all highly swung (and all instruments are perfectly in time with each other), it just sounds inauthentic.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that there’s more to ‘funky’ than syncopation. Simply loading up on syncopation doesn’t automatically make something funky. It just makes it bouncy. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Dude I love penguins, thanks for showing me that!</p>
<p>But seriously, that was really nice to listen to. I reckon I’ll check them out some more <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>btw, I’ve noticed myself that I tend to go overboard with swing and ducker. What can I say? I really like funky basslines and punchy beats. Like, I have an unhealthy addiction to them. I think 3/4 of all my projects including backups comprise of discarded beats n’ bass lines <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/face_with_hand_over_mouth.png?v=5" title=":face_with_hand_over_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_hand_over_mouth:"></p>
<p>Also, when you say texturing, do you mean the layering of the notes into their separate octaves within the primary melody, or the layering of the instruments themselves?</p>

<p>Good melodies. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

<p>Again, like Trey’s piece, it really commits to melody as the impetus within the track.</p>
<p>I can imagine this working well with a live band, possibly rocked up a bit.  Maybe even math rock it up a bit.<br>
The lead melody would make for an interesting rock guitar solo performance piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I checked out a few of your pieces on SC, and it’s clear that you engage with lead melodies, though some are more prominent than others. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>Gave it a listen. (I actually recall hearing it a while ago.)</p>
<p>Definitely very melody based. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think what you have could be developed into a good track, but in its current form, it feels like a compositional draft.<br>
Imo, it would benefit from more work on the composition – and a lot more work on the sound design.</p>
<p>(I’d start on the sound design as that may end up steering compositional changes as the ‘feel’ fleshes out.)</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@3</span>:20? It’s very subtle (and quite short). Not sure I’d characterise it as a solo.</p>
<p>It’s a great track (Liked), though I would characterise the guitar part as more subtly layered over the chords, rather than a prominent feature of the track.</p>

            <p>Not necessarily jazz(y). Hooky? Kinda yeah. Lead melodies that stand out as a prominent feature of the track, rather than ones subtly layered over the chords.</p>
<p>Any genre, any style.</p>

            <p>Thanks👍, and yeah I know what you mean. I had listened to a house track a while back that had a pretty unique drop, and I tried to create my own interpretation of that style, so I was kind of in new territory.</p>
