    <title>[Contest] Auxy Summer Tournament 2K19 - Winners announced</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/contest-auxy-summer-tournament-2k19-winners-announced/15808</link>
    <description>Hi, everybody! ;P DHO back in the house and just in time for another Auxy Tournament! This time with  co-hosts, @stereofield and @BobTheGUYYYYY.

Sign ups are now closed.

How it Works
-
So, as stated in the previous tournament: Players 1-4 are in the tournament. Player 1 ends up against Player 2, and 3 against 4. If Player 1 beats 2, and Player 4 beats 3, then the two winners (1 and 4) will compete. 

In this instance, however, there are 32 players.

Judging
-
You will be judged out of ten points in the following categories:

Creativity - How unique is the song compared to other Auxy tracks? It&#39;s good to have a balance. Sure you can randomly place notes and make automation, and, although it may be different, it&#39;s not necessarily pleasing to listen to.

Composition - How good is the actual composition, when you take out all the automation etc.?

Accuracy: How much you stuck to the challenge&#39;s rules.

Execution: How well did you execute all the ideas you tried to pull off? How is the instrument choice? Mixing?

Challenges
-
After running several season based tournaments, I feel we&#39;ve exhausted our season themed challenges. This time around, challenges will specifically test your skills in each area of producing.

**A few rules: If you wish to use any samples, please check with judges first. Individual hits are generally okay but please no sampled phrases. Work should be predominately completed in Auxy. Additionally, this time around there will be no extensions for late entries. The deadlines will not be extended and you will be disqualified if you do not meet the deadline.**

Prizes
-
The  two finalists will get a :unicorn: to display next to your username. There will also be a repost for the winning track given by the Auxy Collective. 

Always next time
-
Running tournaments is sort of a hobby of mine, so if  you can&#39;t enter this time around, it&#39;s not too late. There will be a seventh Auxy Tournament.

Good luck all! We will post the first challenge as soon as soon as we can after the tournament fills up.

            <p>Hopefully next time Iâ€™ll join and be considered for a unicorn through my work</p>

            <p>Hey everybody, just wanted to to pop in real quick and say there were so many impressive entries in this tournament! Unfortunately I was too busy this summer to be a judge for this one, but I still looked through some of the entries in the later rounds and itâ€™s really amazing what kind of stuff you all are making these days. Keep it up, and Iâ€™m excited to see the final result!</p>

<p>My favorite experience from this yearâ€™s summer was going to a big week-long event, where I met lots of new people. Hereâ€™s a song I wrote to represent those memories.</p>
