    <title>Tomb - Hern [Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/tomb-hern-experimental/19137</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s another single from my upcoming album, Smoke. This cut is a lot more melodic and slow paced than my last single, though it still has some weird experimentation to it. The intro is a pitched down sample of me playing my guitar when it was out of tune. Like I said with the last single, don&#39;t expect the album to be exactly like this. I feel like any track I would&#39;ve chosen would have been misleading, so I&#39;m mainly just picking my favorites as singles.

Anyway, here is the song: https://soundcloud.com/hernmusicofficial/tomb

I hope you guys enjoy this. If you have any constructive criticism, please feel free to give it.</description>

            <p>I was gonna say, I know <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/hern-meridian">@Hern-Meridian</a> exclusively uses Auxy. There’s some folks around here or who used to post here (DoJ comes to mind, K-Ro) that are or were 100% Auxy and did not sound AT ALL like Auxy. Really bending the app to the limits <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Okay it sounds good. But in my opinion, I think it’s just a non auxy track. Just saying. Good job on the song though. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
