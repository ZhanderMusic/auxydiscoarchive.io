    <description>https://soundcloud.com/pistol69/play-by-your-own-rules

Something new from me, I haven’t managed to finish a track for a long time but this came together quite quickly.

Minimal beats with some deep bass which is a new approach from me. 172bpm made from a mixture of samples and Auxy instruments, hope you guys like it let me know what you think.</description>

            <p>Thanks man, great feedback as always. I’m going to try and get a few more tracks out soon, maybe edge towards more of the darker side of dnb like I’ve done before.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you just strike while the iron is hot and it comes together scary fast. I did my whole last EP in 1.5 months signed and sealed, couple hours of work a day. Haven’t done anything since August! Lol.</p>
<p>This is great. I think I recall you putting this in the WIP section? The sub bass is so heavy but clear, it’s great. Just got to the part where you throw some think break in, so good haha. Sample selection over all is on point. This reminds me of like if K-Ro and Aphrodite had a baby haha.</p>
<p>Awesome! Not much else to say you’re wielding the power of ReSlice and AudioShare very well <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
