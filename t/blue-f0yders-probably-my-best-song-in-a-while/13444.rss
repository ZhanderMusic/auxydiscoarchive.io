    <title>Blue - F0yders (Probably my best song in a while.)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/blue-f0yders-probably-my-best-song-in-a-while/13444</link>

https://soundcloud.com/f0ydersmusic/blue

I honestly think it is my best track in a while.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.</description>
