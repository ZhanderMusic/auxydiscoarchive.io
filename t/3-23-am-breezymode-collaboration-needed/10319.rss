    <title>3:23 am- breezymode (Collaboration needed!)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/3-23-am-breezymode-collaboration-needed/10319</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I have a few open WIPs right now, most noteably a track that has really nice ascending/descending sounds and I think it could be a slapper if I can get someone to help me flush the song out a little bit and bring some thunderous, saucy bass to the party. 

Let me know if you are interested and we can talk about it! I understand there will be some leg work that goes into this but I’m here to help and you can take primary credit for the track on soundcloud or any music streaming platform as long as I am named as a feature on the track (3:23 am-? (Ft. Breezymode))
