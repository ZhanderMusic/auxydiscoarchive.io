I was playing around with a track me and @Xiejra are making. I don’t know how to say it but, this is how to make it, *I guess*. I think you use 3 or 4 different key tones in Silk with its tone and shape on 100% and it’s lowpass to 50%. That’s the simplest way I can put it to y’all.</description>

            <p>Silk is loveeely. I used that “vocal” sound throughout this song. (It’s a bit long but it’s right at the start)</p>
