    <description>Because I haven’t yet gotten premium, I’ve been stuck with the few sounds the demo gives you, and I’ve been surprised what you can make with such restrictions! This gave me the idea that there could be challenges where only a few sounds could be used, and the best to use that specific set of sounds out would win. What would you guys think of a challenge like this?</description>
