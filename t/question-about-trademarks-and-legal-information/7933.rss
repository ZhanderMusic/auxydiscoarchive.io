    <title>Question about Trademarks and Legal Information</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/question-about-trademarks-and-legal-information/7933</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was just wondering. Let’s say you upload a track on SoundCloud under some alias. What if a person has the same alias and discovers that you allegedly “used” theirs? Do they have the right to sue you? Or do you have the right to sue them?</description>

<p>Do they have the right to sue you? Or do you have the right to sue them?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Whoever has precedence (who demonstrably used it first) would be the one able to sue - but typically* only if they’ve actually registered it as a trademark.</p>
<p>* If they’re just using it as an unregistered trademark, then they would only stand a chance of being able to sue you if they’d been using it for a long time and had built up substantial recognition within the same industry and audience - to the point where the audience might reasonably assume music released under that name to have come from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(You don’t need to register a trademark to use the ™ symbol. A properly registered trademark often appears with the ® symbol. Registration give some you legal protection against copiers, though generally only within the same or closely related industries.)</p>

            <p>You should talk to them and try to figure out a way to work it out. Maybe Make a minor adjustment, such as changing the o to a zero, or something like that, rather than sue them, if Voltt as it’s own is Not trademarked.</p>
