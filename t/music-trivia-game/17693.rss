    <title>Music Trivia Game</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/music-trivia-game/17693</link>
    <description>You are supposed to post a short track, and ask questions you know the answer for. For instance, you can ask what genre it is. You cannot ask more than three questions, just to let everybody have a chance to post. Any link is allowed. This can include remixes, but you have to mention who made it. You will have to reply to the question to answer. Each question should be answered individually. Please don’t ask how it works. The person who guessed correctly will be mentioned on the [Trivia Game Answers](https://disco.auxy.co/t/trivia-game-answers/17698/2). 

So I will start:

What song is this a remix of? [CLAIMED]
