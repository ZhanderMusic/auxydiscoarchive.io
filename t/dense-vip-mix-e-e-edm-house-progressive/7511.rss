    <title>Dense (VIP Mix) - E/E [EDM, House, Progressive]</title>

VIP mix of my very first electronic track produced as E/E, using a mixture of Auxy and FL Studio for the first time! I am proud to present to you the fully realized form of Dense, a piece centered around orchestral strings and strong saw wave synths at the drop. Everything is so tightly packed together in one small package, waiting to be listened to. Dense in composition, let the music flow through you.

Special thanks to @anon41616463 and @blackocean for all the help and advice about EQing this. It would have sounded terrible without their help</description>
