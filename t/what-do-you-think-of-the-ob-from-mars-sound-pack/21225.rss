            <p>I know I‚Äôm late, but this is finally a useful pack.</p>
<p>Raver and Tom Sawyer are LEGENDARY</p>
<p>Although there‚Äôs many instruments like Tom Sawyer already in sweet pads that are better, Tom Sawyer sounds truly unique comparing them.</p>
<p>Raver‚Ä¶is next level. I would‚Äôve never expected anything like raver to come out! Not just is raver a legendary lead, you can use it as a bass that sound really cool as well.</p>

            <p>Back on topic‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Are sound packs sample-based or entirely synthesised?</p>
<p>I just felt that the sounds in this pack sounded quite like variants of sounds from other packs. Or at least, they have an ‚ÄòAuxy sound‚Äô, imo.</p>
<p>I was surprised and pleased to see Shape (Decay?) make a reappearance. I just wish it was available for all sounds (as Decay).</p>
<p>I like that there are retro packs (I‚Äôm a fan of the sound of classic analogue synths), but it feels like there‚Äôs a whole suite of sounds and timbres that we‚Äôre not really getting.<br>
(Not sure if that‚Äôs a licensing cost thing or a synth engine capabilities thing.)</p>
<p>At this point, I don‚Äôt feel that sound packs have been adding huge amounts of value. I‚Äôm really only subbing to Auxy now to have access to the many many sketches and semi-developed tracks in there that I intend to develop further in the future.</p>
<p>[Edit: I should add that I‚Äôm not suggesting that we could end sound pack releases. I think they need to continue, but I‚Äôd like to see the variety and quality increase ‚Äî though I‚Äôm not sure either is likely to happen unless/until they raise the subs price (which I‚Äôd be in favour of, if it leads to more interesting selection of sounds, substantial new features, etc‚Ä¶)]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which names are repeated?</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry, but wow. Really?</p>
<p>Someone at Auxy should be paying attention to these things <em>before</em> they ship. This is 101 stuff.</p>
<ol>
<li>You didn‚Äôt immediately recognise the duplicate name and rule it out before release - bc you know your own product inside and out, right?</li>
<li>When the mistake was identified, you asked a user to identify the specifics, rather than take two mins to check for yourself (for a mistake that wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Auxy had the right processes or if anyone was paying attention)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, it wasn‚Äôt a huge one, but it kinda suggests that Team Auxy are kinda phoning it in these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Haven‚Äôt used it yet, but when I first saw the new kit, and the repeated names, my first thought was whether projects will correctly identify which instrument is meant to be used.)</p>
