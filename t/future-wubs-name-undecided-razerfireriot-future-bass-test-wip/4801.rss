    <title>Future Wubs [Name undecided] - RazerFireRiot (Future Bass, Test, WIP)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/future-wubs-name-undecided-razerfireriot-future-bass-test-wip/4801</link>
    <description>So I recently listened to @aUstin_Haga’s song Changes, and the bassdrop is what got my attention. I decided to try it on my own using Hour and Otter with the almighty automation, and this nice little idea came out.

I was thinking of some feedback of how it sounds as a future bass track before proceeding :wink:
