Hey everyone, sorry for disappearing for a while. Being a perfectionist really takes a toll on activity sometimes. But it’s finally done and posted! Y0UNG, a fusion of Future Bass and Drums &amp; Bass is out. Special thanks to both @HAYVN for making such amazing Drums &amp; Bass tracks for inspiring the track and giving some advice as well as @blackocean for his support and advice, especially on the drop and making it heavier. It’s a real treat, so enjoy!</description>
