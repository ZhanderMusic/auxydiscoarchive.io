    <description>I’m super pleased with where it’s headed, but I also think I’m losing objectivity.

[Interweb of Nets ](https://soundcloud.com/scott-rosenthal-232412526/the-interweb-of-nets-edit-b-2/s-AG2Al)

To anybody who is willing, I’d really appreciate any critical feedback. (In the soundcloud song comments would be fine) 

Eg. Are certain instruments too loud, or too repetitive, too much reverb, filter cut-offs too low, EQ problems, other ideas, etc… Literally anything…

I would gladly reciprocate. Participating in track critiques has been extremely valuable to me.</description>
