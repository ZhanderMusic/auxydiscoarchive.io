            <p>would say serum if you have the budget and want the best of the best, but I personally use Helm as my go-to plugin for sounds, which is free.  It’s not as versatile as serum, but it works just fine for my tracks rn and the rest can honestly be done with other plugins (that are also free lol).</p>

            <p>Europa, Serum, Thor (Reason or iOS specific), Reason Compact (read iEuropa), Sunrizer - basically any subtractive style synth be it iOS or desktop/laptop land. They’re pretty common features.</p>

            <p>It would still be a detuned saw. those exist outside of Auxy</p>
<p>Edit: you could probably use Serum for this, since it has a unison and detune option, although there are free synths that could do this too. Just search for synths with unison and detune options</p>
