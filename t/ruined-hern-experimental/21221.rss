    <title>Ruined - Hern [Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/ruined-hern-experimental/21221</link>
    <description>New track for an upcoming project with no set release date. This song combines a lot of the long, drawn out songwriting of my last album with the harsh noise and sample based chaos of some of my previous works. The first half of the song consists of a lot of odd, chaotic segments switching back and forth between each other before mellowing out halfway through into a noisy and harmonious build towards the end, which eventually gets caked in distortion. Uh so if any of that sounds cool to you pls listen.

Track link is here (Runtime - 12:41):
