            <p>Oh lord. Who made this mess?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If announcing a new album, post it in the WIP category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If posting about a new finished track, post it in the FINISHED TRACKS category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the track already has a topic under FINISHED TRACKS and is now released on Spotify too, then post that update under the original topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely don’t post in in multiple categories or under Branding &amp; Distribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“<strong>Branding &amp; Distribution:</strong> All about building your artist brand and distributing your tracks. Post tracks in the respective categories though, not here!”</p>
<p>Yep. All of those things.</p>

            <p>well… technically he’s distributing his music to Spotify, so it goes in the branding &amp; distribution category</p>
<p>the mods know best so if I’m incorrect they can change it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>… and yeah, im just stoked for the album tbh</p>

</aside>
<p>He hasn’t posted anything about this track before on the forums. So this is the first time he’s posting about anything in regards to this. I think if there was multiple threads, that may be an issue, but there aren’t. No use getting into a tizzy.</p>

            <p>Fwiw, I think that posts regarding one of the biggest distribution platforms in the world (Spotify) would do fine in the category he selected. Regardless, I don’t think that anybody is confused because he posted here instead of in finished tracks. Therefore, how about focus on his awesome upcoming EP instead of which category would perfectly suit his announcement <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/musical_note.png?v=6" title=":musical_note:" class="emoji" alt=":musical_note:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Then, imo, the right way to post about it would be to announce the new/coming soon release in Finished Tracks and add the addendum there and also update the original thread.</p>
<p>Just seems cleaner and more appropriate.</p>

            <p>That’s an option. But I think this is more of an announcement to this being a new album/EP project that will be releasing soon. The addendum is the track, which appears to be part of it, being out on <s>sporty</s> spotify as a single.</p>

            <p>So, perhaps update the original Finished Track thread?</p>
<p>If people start routinely starting new threads for every each platform, it’s gonna get messy really quickly.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of posts on there for each track successfully moved onto Spotify in that thread.</p>

<p>Then maybe post about the track now being on Spotify in that thread?</p>

            <p>I do think this is the right category for making spotify-related post announcements, if <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/wooo-im-on-spotify/4826/">this thread</a> is anything to go by. If anything, the title could have been worded differently to clear up any confusion but I don’t think Phluze did any spamming here.</p>
