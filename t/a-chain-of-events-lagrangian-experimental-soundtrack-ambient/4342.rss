    <title>A Chain of Events - lagrangian [Experimental, Soundtrack, Ambient]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-chain-of-events-lagrangian-experimental-soundtrack-ambient/4342</link>
    <description>My BTC #22 entry turned into quite a project. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different effects and different sounds trying to simulate real life sounds. I ended up connecting it to [Chase](https://soundcloud.com/lagrangain/chase), funny enough, and I ended up giving it a few tweaks in this new version. All in all, this is a two song release with an extra bit at the end of The Night Bus. Without further ado, I present to you [A Chain of Events](https://soundcloud.com/lagrangain/sets/a-chain-of-events). :tada: :musical_keyboard:</description>
