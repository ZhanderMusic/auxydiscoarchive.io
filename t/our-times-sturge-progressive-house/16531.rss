    <title>Our Times - Sturge [Progressive House]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/our-times-sturge-progressive-house/16531</link>
    <description>Here is a Progressive House track I made....well I think it’s Progressive House? Well you can tell me if I am wrong haha....I get easily mixed up with my EDM sub-genres. Anyway, I’ve worked hard for that one and I really like how it came out. I really hope you guys will enjoy it.


Here is the track : https://soundcloud.com/lord-sturge/our-times
