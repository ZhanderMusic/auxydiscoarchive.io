            <p>Wasn’t really feeling it at the start. Felt a bit primitive - especially the chords, which feel heavy-handed.</p>
<p>But, when the main part kicks in, I started to get it.</p>
<p>The main section, with the choice of vocal chops and percussion, has a real Four Tet / Caribou / maybe Lusine vibe, which I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I think the chords are a little too high in the mix, but an interesting piece that deserves to be fleshed out as a ‘full length’ track.</p>
<p>In terms of genre, I think you’d be doing the (finished) track a disservice by tagging it as house or lofi house. I’d go for something aimed at attracting more sophisticated Four Tet / Caribou / Lusine listeners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As you shared the project file for remixes, I might just have a play with it, though more as my take on how the track could be fleshed out and finished, than a full-on remix.</p>
<p>Although, if you’re planning to flesh it out, etc. yourself, I’ll wait. I’m interested to hear what you do with it.</p>
<p>A great, interesting vibe that deserves to be developed further. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
