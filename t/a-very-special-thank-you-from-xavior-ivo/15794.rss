    <description>[A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU!](https://soundcloud.com/xaviormusic/omnipotent-vip)

I felt the need to acknowledge those who have given me continuous support from the moment I started posting my music and the creators and developers of Auxy Music Studio who gave me the tools to express myself the ways I&#39;ve always wanted. 
It&#39;s a bit of a cliche to call it a musical journey, but that&#39;s exactly what it has been, and a thrilling one at that. Never did I believe that I would be able to develop the skills that would allow me to produce and release tracks like this. The first time I released &#39;Omnipotent&#39;, I knew that I had found my niche. It took time to get to the point where I could feel totally confident in what I&#39;m able to create, and even so I know that there&#39;s room for improvement, yet I&#39;m never discouraged. 
I&#39;ve been so humbled and honored over the past couple of years, and I only hope to keep sharing with you one of my deepest, must honest passions.
So, in the one way I can truly show you, I give my very special, sincere, *Thank You*!</description>

            <p>dude it’s so crazy(in a good way) that we all get to connect like this here… I mean Auxy was made and then here we are, few folks with similar goals who LOVE to make some unique tunes and I’m glad Auxy made that happen in a way. It’s getting bigger imo and brings more and more people closer to accomplishing their dreams and stuffs.</p>
<p>so yeah I think I get an idea of what you’re saying because I feel somewhat the same way of having this beautiful gift I guess…</p>
<p>I’m glad you’re a part of all this man and I’m sure the rest of us feel the same for each other!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

If there’s anything that matters to me about music, it’s being able to share these stories and expressions and giving others the confidence to do the same!</p>
<p>P.S. The explicit music has always been a bit of a stunt. Never liked being told what I can and can’t put out (especially just because it happens to be shared with members of a community that don’t really appreciate the unique approach and effort, but are instead too focused on sounding like others to get the most amount of likes and reposts). But sometimes a bad word speaks volumes more, so don’t be surprised if those appear in future releases <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
