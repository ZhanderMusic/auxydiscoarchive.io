            <p>There’s an awful lot going on at once. I think you’ve got good ideas in here, but there needs to be a little more breathing room. I really like the filtered drums in the beginning, but the pace of the drums throughout are a little monotonous. Is the sweeper floating in the background at higher and lower volumes?</p>
<p>If you did that to emulate wind I get it, it works, but to me it’s distracting from the other ideas you’ve got going on in here.</p>
