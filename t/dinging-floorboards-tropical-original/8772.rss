    <title>Dinging Floorboards - Tropical Original</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dinging-floorboards-tropical-original/8772</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I hate to say this but this might be my last track for awhile. My SoundCloud minutes are out and this was the only song I could bring out. I’m buying pro unlimited in the future. 

Anyways here is the song.

Soundcloud: [Dinging Floorboards-Tropical Original](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/dinging-floorboards-tropical)

This wait might be a long while and I’m not sure when I will be back. So I’ll see you all soon!

Tell me what you think of the song. This is my number 1 song of the year. (Until I make a new finished song)</description>

            <p>Sounds really good. Mad skills.<br>
Btw it could be more catchy if you start with the leading bass earlier.</p>
<p>Nevertheless you do a very very good job. Go ahead!</p>
