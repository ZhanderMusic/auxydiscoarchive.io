            <p>You’re pretty much on the money there mate! It’s actually more simple than you may think. I’m a big fan of silk for choirs. A bit of low pass, lots of reverb- you can see how I set it. A key thing is using chords that are wide and open- chords with too many close notes will sound cluttered. Here’s the choir from panther as well as an extra loop. The extra loop is an example of how I might structure a big chord- you can see where I build on it each bar. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Sounds like Silk with the tone all the way up and the pitch lowered an octave with automation.</p>

            <p>Hmm maybe a combination of Sweet Aaa, and Silk? You could ask <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a> to know for sure though.</p>
