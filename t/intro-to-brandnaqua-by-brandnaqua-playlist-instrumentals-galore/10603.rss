    <description>Hi guys so after using Auxy for a year I finally have a debut playlist made! Comprised of 15 tracks these are instrumentals which will also be released with lyrics very soon! I made them in Auxy and just eq-ed and maximized them in a mastering app for iOS. Please leave comments and criticisms. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thank-you and I love Auxy: future of music. I’m gonna win Grammy’s one day be like “yo, I only make music in Auxy!!” I promise!! haha
