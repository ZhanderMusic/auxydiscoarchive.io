    <title>Closure (A) - Hern [Genre?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/closure-a-hern-genre/21590</link>
    <description>Not exactly sure what genre this is, but it’s an experiment with some horns, strings, and piano. Planning for this to be a part of a longer series of tracks, potentially an EP? Not exactly sure at the moment, but we’ll see.

Link is here (Runtime - 9:12): https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/sD8JUcV7qzzNi4SdA

Hope you guys enjoy, constructive criticism is welcome as always.</description>

            <p>Not sure of a genre, though Instrumental Avant-Pop came to mind (and/or Contemporary Classical and/or ‘Chamber Pop’), shifting more to the filmic end of Electronic later on. It’s a tricky one.</p>
<p>…but I loved it.</p>
<p>Would have loved the sax to be a bit clearer in the mix. What I could make out, I really liked what you were doing with it, with contemporary jazz moments.</p>
<p>That 1:30–2:15 section is fantastic.</p>
<p>I’ll give it another listen tomorrow on better kit. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=10" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
