    <title>Should I get a SoundCloud?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/should-i-get-a-soundcloud/8498</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I&#39;ve been producing for about a year, overall, using FL Studio and (more recently), Auxy, and I&#39;m wondering whether I should get a SoundCloud page.

It seems like SoundCloud is what everyone around here uses. What do you guys like about it? What do you guys _not_ like about it?

Somebody else has already taken the username “norfleet” so I tried “norfleetmusic”. That’s okay, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/norfleetmusic" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/norfleetmusic</a></p>
<p>I’ve also posted my first track on there! It’s not Auxy (so I didn’t make a thread about it), but I hope you will check it out.</p>

            <p>Out of the three main music distribution platforms (SoundCloud, Spotify, iTunes) SoundCloud is probably the most “accessible” for a smaller producer while still having a very large user base.</p>
<p>Definitely post a couple of your tracks there if you’re interested in community feedback and possibly moving towards monetization in the future.</p>
<p>As a side note, I also like having my finished tracks on SoundCloud because it allows me to add them to playlists and listen to them along with tracks from other producers.</p>

            <p>Great for distribution + exposure, if you actively promote yourself in the beginning.</p>
<p>Fun way to get feedback on music and get your name brand out there.</p>
<p>Also is like the gateway drug to Spotify and iTunes imo</p>

            <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>Soundcloud is a simple way to post tracks and get feedback. I definitely recommend putting some tracks on there. Of course, It isn’t top of the line music distribution, like Itunes, Spotify, etc. But it can definitely help showcase your work.</p>
<p>(Its also free <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">)</p>
