    <title>My Home - Eswyn [Ambient Chill]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-home-eswyn-ambient-chill/17803</link>
    <description>Here’s a little track that stemmed off of a track with a very different vibe (complextro). I took the breakdown from that track (it’s still in the works) and shifted it into a major key, tweaked some chords and added some new stuff, worked on it for a while, and now we’ve got this. It’s a pretty neat little track, and I hope you enjoy it. I’m working on an extended edit as well, plus the original complextro track is still in the works. Enjoy!
