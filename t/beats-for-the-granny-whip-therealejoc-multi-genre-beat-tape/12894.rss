    <title>BEATS FOR THE GRANNY WHIP - therealejoc [MULTI GENRE][BEAT TAPE]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/beats-for-the-granny-whip-therealejoc-multi-genre-beat-tape/12894</link>
    <description>Been a while since I put anything out, all beats were made in auxy. I decided to release a beat tape of the beats i&#39;m planning on using for my official mixtape. Lots to choose from. &quot;Smile!&quot; and &quot;Coffee.&quot; and &quot;STEPS&quot; are all finished tracks, meaning I do not plan to add additional lyrics. I know it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been around the forum, I got a new phone and mostly forgot about it until just now. Thanks anyways and enjoy!
