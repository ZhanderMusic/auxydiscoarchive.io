    <title>Mr Mooo / escape. (alt explanation)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mr-mooo-escape-alt-explanation/17621</link>
    <description>some of you may have seen escape on soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/escape_official).
that is my alt.
i started this with being anonymous in mind because i wanted to start afresh from my mr mooo account with no association, but i see no point to that anymore, so i’m just stating it as my alt. i’ve only released one song on that account, but prepare for an album/ep sometime soon (maybe) and some more songs.
sorry to anyone who talked to me assuming i was new to the community but i wanted anonymity at that point.
if you have any questions about this, feel free to ask me!</description>

            <p>Dang lmao. never would have thought that escape was you.  Really cool to see such a different vibe between the two names.</p>
<p>Personally I liked the anonymity with escape just someone random blowing up lol. Or maybe revealing yourself after you potentially release the album for a bigger effect.</p>
<p>Still tho, is your account, you do you.</p>
