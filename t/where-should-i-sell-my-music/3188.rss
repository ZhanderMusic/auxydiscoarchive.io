    <title>Where Should I Sell My Music?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-should-i-sell-my-music/3188</link>
    <description>Hey guys, do you have any ideas where I should sell my music? I was thinking Bandcamp because it&#39;s very straightforward, but I wanted to see if anybody has suggestions.</description>

<p>Having your music available for purchase in a lossless format is critical if you want it to be played on radio or in a club.</p>

            <p>But… but… I buy music! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As I understand it, it’s hard to make a living, let alone a really good living, from the sales/plays of the music alone — unless you’re huge on the mainstream and everything routinely gets millions of plays.<br>
For lesser artists, a lot of the money they make will be from gigs/appearances and merchandise.</p>
<p>This is a problem for EDM, as so many in that genre are faceless bedroom producers. That’s why, especially in EDM, you’ll need to push.</p>
<p>It’s true what you say though about ‘buying music’. My recent Bandcamp purchases were a bit of an inconvenience, format-wise</p>
<p>I live in Spotify, so the first thing I did with those files was bring them into Spotify. I also bring my own stuff into Spotify as MP3s.</p>
<p>I think the game-changer is that anyone can distribute on Spotify, etc… now. In the early days of Spotify, if you had even slightly niche tastes in music, you weren’t gonna find it on Spotify. Even on popular, but non-mainstream bands (e.g. Squarepusher), albums and tracks would come and then go, because back then they were only licensed for a fixed period.</p>

            <p>I agree. Though people, when you reply to that please don’t say you buy<br>
music and that his point is invalid. Some people still buy music, but<br>
that’s much more in the ambient/sound design-oriented/indie community. Yes,<br>
some people still buy EDM and trap and stuff, but it’s a lot easier to<br>
listen on streaming services.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if anyone buys music anymore, under 20 or over. There is so little reason to… so streaming distribution is probably is the way to go. But at $.04 per play it’s best to get and keep a good day job. I’d love to see what happens though. I mean when I was 16 people were still using cassette tapes, its hard to explain how unbelievable this level of distribution and collaboration for free is. I don’t need to get rich; Boom, mind being blown is enough.</p>

            <p>The only music I’ve bought in the past couple of years has been via Bandcamp. (Everything else comes via streaming service subscriptions, primarily Spotify.)</p>
<p>(Slightly annoyingly*, I most recently bought two releases (minimal/drone/ambient**) by a guy called <a href="https://lfzunlimited.bandcamp.com/">LFZ</a>, before realising I hadn’t initially searched properly on Spotify – they’re both on there. D’oh!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* …though not majorly. I’m happy to put money in the guy’s hands and give support as I’ve been playing those two releases solidly since discovering them.</p>
<p>** I fancy making some minimalist drone in Auxy.</p>

            <p>Something I found regarding how Amuse makes money. Note: A previous statement was made that Amuse make their money by selling user data.</p>
<p>Written by username “Andreas Ahlenius” 2 months ago</p>
<p>Hey! I am one of the co-founders of Amuse. Thanks for posting about us. Let me clarify our business model though. We DO NOT sell data to third parties at all. We are a record label that does digital music distribution for free. Our business model is to sign artists to our label. By providing free distribution we get access to a lot of interesting new artists. We look at the data we get from the services like spotify, apple music and youtube etc, to understand which of the thousands of artists using our service that is generating true fans. The ones we think we can help and become future stars, we offer a license deal. In the case where the artist wants to work with us, our deal is simple, we split profits 50/50. So that’s how we make money, by providing a free, fair and simple service to distribute your music and when there is opportunity to make something big we partner with the artist. More info on <a href="http://www.amuse.io">www.amuse.io</a></p>

            <p>I’ve seen that problem referenced about songs already public on SoundCloud several times. I had mine approved by <a href="http://amuse.io">amuse.io</a> already and have this Friday as a release date and many are public on SoundCloud. Was it the stores that hold it up, or amuse? I’m either past that hurdle or haven’t hit it yet. Anyone able to clarify their experience? TIO</p>

            <p>It worked for Halogen and Harmony. It should work for you as well! =D</p>
<p>Make sure the song isn’t already on SC though as a public track.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t make it legit though. I still don’t trust anything that is marketed as completely free. Suspicious. Here I am using Auxy tho <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=5" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
