    <description>Think of this as an early Christmas present @Auxy :laughing:
Actually though, this song is really cool imo. (I think that stands for in my opinion?) Please listen to it and give me any feedback. I&#39;m very excited to see what you guys think!

Also this is the first time I made an actual cover for the song, so tell me what you think about this too!

            <p>I really enjoyed this one. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>It‚Äôs definitely not DnB though.<br>
I thought it had quite a strong UK House vibe.</p>

            <p>This doesn‚Äôt really sound like DnB. I‚Äôd say this is like Electro House‚Ä¶ DnB is usually much faster than this. But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nice and dark and heavy. This is epic!</p>
