    <title>Where do your songs come from?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/where-do-your-songs-come-from/5250</link>
    <description>Hello,

I just wanted to apologize if I ever offended anyone. That is not the kind of person I am and what I would like to know as. I never meant to offend anyone. I hope to be more involved in the community in the future.

I have an EP coming out in a while. 

For me to know more about the people in the community I wanted to ask you guys a question

When you create a new song, do you get your inspiration from songs your listen to or do you create songs organically and see how it will sound?</description>

            <p>Some were from sounds I heard. Others were from experimentation or thinking up different melodies or basslines.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I goes one of two ways for me:<br>
Way the first - I hear a cool song that someone else made and I try to emulate it in my own way<br>
Way the second - I fiddle around in Auxy until I make something cool. Then, it just goes from there.</p>
<p>Usually I go the second route, but still use the first way for parts of the song.<br>
Overall though, pretty much all of my music is inspired by the music I hear in my favorite video games.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just wanted to apologize if I ever offended anyone. That is not the kind of person I am and what I would like to know as. I never meant to offend anyone. I hope to be more involved in the community in the future.</p>
<p>I have an EP coming out in a while.</p>
<p>For me to know more about the people in the community I wanted to ask you guys a question</p>
<p>When you create a new song, do you get your inspiration from songs your listen to or do you create songs organically and see how it will sound?</p>
