    <title>World - Tropical Original</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/world-tropical-original/8660</link>
    <description>Hello friends! Today I have a regular song. I’ve gave up on the Continuum Series and going to have the seven songs on an album soon. Please hang tight for that.

My season 3 of songs is about to end and stay tuned for some more remastered songs! 

Anyways here is the track.

Soundcloud: [World - Tropical Original](https://soundcloud.com/tropical_madman/world-tropical-original)

When season 4 comes out you will start to hear more ambient songs due to a game I am designing later on in the future. It is taking time to make and will finish it around my high school graduation if not longer. Don’t worry there will still be other  genres. I will start to make more songs to stay active with you all and my followers. I will also start posting my songs on YouTube for other reasons. I currently can’t post about this due to regulations. 


You all have a fantastic day!</description>

            <p>Sure. I need some practice on my drums patterns and when to use them. I’m not as experienced. But I’ll send you the project.</p>

            <p>A really simple, cool and emotive lead and chord progression. Good stuff.<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Stuff like this is precisely why I keep urging users to use Chromatic mode. The option to switch between major and minor in interesting ways becomes more direct and keeps you constantly open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>In this case, it allowed you to move between plaintive and uplifting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I think it would sound great if you went ‘big’ at some point (or, at least, bigger), bringing in some big chords and an epic lead melody.<br>
The lead you have now is cool, but it doesn’t really feel, to me, like a lead that’s really taking the lead and owning it, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I wasn’t a fan of the drums. Felt the drum sounds were paired well and weren’t adding any interesting contrast. Also, I found the earlier drum pattern way too ‘jaunty’ due to the heavy (excessive) swing.</p>
<p>I think the 4/4 worked more successfully, and that this track could be reworked as a purely 4/4 piece.<br>
But, as the lead/chords were so emotive, I kept wondering what some gritty, edgier drums would have sounded like. I think that contrast could be really interesting - and different.</p>
<p>(If I didn’t have my own backlog of stuff in development, I’d be tempted to grab the project and try a remix.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
And, yes, I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/milchmann">@Milchmann</a> - the claves are too loud.</p>

            <p>Love the lead synth, very nice. The click at the end seems to be a bit loud <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> great track.</p>
