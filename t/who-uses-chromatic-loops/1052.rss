    <title>Who uses Chromatic Loops?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/who-uses-chromatic-loops/1052</link>
    <description>Hey guys! My name is Brandon, i&#39;m new to music. I really love how Auxy makes things so easy for me, but I do have a concern. So I see that there is an option to make loops chromatic, which I believe just turns it into the standard keyboard format. I&#39;ve always struggled with that, but is that the way I should be trying to learn or should I just stick to using Auxy with that option turned off? What i&#39;ve been making sounds like music. I&#39;m super critical so I do believe i&#39;d be able to pick up on whether it sounds awful or not. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s so hard to believe that there&#39;s actually something simple enough that could be used properly without knowing formal music theory so I feel like I may doing it wrong, although I like the sounds i&#39;m working on. What techniques do you guys use? Does everyone just work their own way? Do some of you have a lot of experience and knowledge of formal music theory? Do some of you just go with your own flow? And if you do know music theory do you wind up breaking those rules anyway to create new types of sounds? Let me know! I&#39;m really interested to see what all of you do to make your tracks, plus any advice i&#39;d be highly appreciative of! :D</description>

            <p>If I choose a scale, I typically make it work within that. I assume others do too but maybe I’m wrong.  I think having the scales, and then being able to change specific loops chromatic is perfect, you can always copy, paste, make chromatic, move a few notes</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The reason we started out with the scale mode as default was that we wanted to use the limited screen space efficiently and most popular songs (pop etc.) always stay in scale and very rarely break out into different keys or modulate between major/minor etc. One issue with the current design is that it can be hard to make sure that you’re actually starting out in the right scale. I.e. you might start a melody and then you have to turn on chromatic to get to certain notes, and most of the time this is because you’re actually not in the key that the app is currently set to.</p>

            <p>I intentionally complicate chord progression due to the influence of jazz and fusion (Examples…Pat Metheny, Stevie Wonder, Jamiroquai, Bobby Tank, Dirty Loops, etc.), but I have not exactly studied the jazz theory.</p>
<p>I’m composing it all in my intuition.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s hitting those <s>wrong</s> unplanned notes that have led to some of my best (imo) ideas. By having access to more possible ‘mistakes’, you also increase the number of ‘good’ possibilities — and could end up taking a piece in an exciting new direction you never expected it to go. (That’s where I think it can actually have a real impact on your music, for better or worse, without you even realising it.)</p>
<p>I can see the attraction of having a scale set out for you, and there’s still so much you can do with that ‘limitation’, but it’s a little too much like colouring inside the lines/painting by numbers, and tbh, lazy, for my tastes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
I think <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/giomakyo">@GioMakyo</a>’s advice is good, for those unsure about using chromatic scales from the get-go…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try programming something in minor mode then switching it to chromatic and try moving one of the notes up or down half a step, and you’ll start seeing the possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
And, then when 12 notes are too clean for you, there’s detuning and ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music">microtonal</a>’. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I’ve been using chromatic loops more recently, and have been absolutely loving it. A song I’m working on currently has all chromatic loops, and so far I’m pleased with it. It depends on how you make your music. It can be confusing to some, because you have the semitones to worry about, and placing down chords and melodies may be trickier at times, but once you get a feel for it, you’ll become more accustomed to using it, and you’ll find that over time it’s easier to work with. Practice makes progress. (:</p>

            <p>I always use chromatic loops because they allow me to switch between major and minor or do key changes within a loop. Don’t worry if you don’t use chromatic loops. As long as you make amazing music, it doesn’t matter how you made it, chromatic or not.</p>

            <p>I almost never use chromatic loops. I think everyone just has their own way to create music. Some find chromatic loops easier to use, and some don’t. I don’t study music theory or even really know about it. I just place some notes down and move them around until they sound good. Just try to find <em>your</em> way to create music. Figure out what is best for you.</p>

            <p>It really depends if you are used to modern musical studios. For me, using a 7 note layout is easier to use than the Chromatic layout. For my sister, <em>who’s used the piano since she was in grade school,</em> she prefers to use the Chromatic scale.</p>

            <p>Lately (like in the last week or so) yes. But only because I’m trying to recreate what I’m playing on guitar in Auxy and I’m absolute garbage at music theory. So when in chromatic I can be scale independent and figure out what notes I’m playing, then plot them.</p>
<p>But when not doing that I just lock scale <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/kissing_smiling_eyes.png?v=5" title=":kissing_smiling_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":kissing_smiling_eyes:"></p>

            <p>My sister started using Auxy for at least half a year now and she uses it for recreating her favorite songs. She uses the chromatic scale since she doesn’t fully know what key a song should be <em>even though a quick google search answers her question.</em></p>
