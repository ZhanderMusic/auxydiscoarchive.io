    <title>Which sounds should have shape automation?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/which-sounds-should-have-shape-automation/20499</link>
    <description>Heya! We&#39;re looking at adding shape automation to some of the new sounds that have been released since we removed this as a default option. We don&#39;t think every sound needs it, though, so curious to hear if there are any specific sounds that you think should have shape automation?</description>

            <p>Most of the melodic sounds I think would be a good option.</p>

            <p>Btw. check the latest pack, Solar Eclipse, where some of the sounds have shape implemented in the way I have suggested here.</p>

            <p>I’m not a developer so I don’t know how difficult this would be to incorporate but… This used to be a “default” option… why not let it be just that. If you really want to get technical and experiment with your sounds, let the sounds have it… even if it might not per say “need it.”</p>

            <p>My “small” list would include</p>
<ul>
<li>Compression, likewise with Signature Pianos</li>
<li>Stereo Delay</li>
<li>Flanger/Phaser, likewise with Silk from 7 Skies Collection</li>
</ul>
<p>But some others would be nice if there’s another “”“overhaul”"" with automation, like dynamically altered modulation where the artist can dynamically change bitcrusher’s sliders to alter the sound of it on the fly within the song itself.</p>
<p>there’s other stuff that I want Auxy to have, but I don’t think it would fit in well within this post.</p>

            <p>Each sound would need to be designed for that, and I am sure that’s far too much work to implement. Not that it couldn’t or shouldn’t be done, but that’s a lot of files you’d need to add. Think of all the copy and pasting you’d have to do!</p>

            <p>Would be great great for the effects panel to be modular. What I mean by modular: you can swap out either “distortion” or “chorus” out for “phaser, vibrato, etc.”.</p>

            <p>He clearly misses the point with that response. He’s certainly failing to recognise the opportunity.</p>

<p>Sure, Auxy reposts on their SC account are a good way to bring attention to tracks created in Auxy. But, as pointed out elsewhere (and repeatedly), it’s also the best content for promoting Auxy itself.<br>
Right now, no-one is discovering Auxy music via any Auxy channel. Right now, few, if any, are discovering Auxy through any (non-advertising) marketing activity by Auxy.</p>
<p>It’s not rocket surgery. Any promotion Auxy marketing can do to elevate deserving tracks made in Auxy will only reflect back on to Auxy, as Auxy starts to be discussed as a legitimate music production workflow tool.</p>
<p>The fact the he talks about it as a ‘need’, rather than simply good (content) marketing strategy for growth and brand building shows how short-sighted things have become.</p>
<p>They seem content to let Auxy freewheel until it runs out of steam completely.</p>
<p>And that’s a real shame.</p>

    Hey everyone! I was playing around on Auxy today and just dropped the sickest beat but I won’t be able to use it in the track and post it.
