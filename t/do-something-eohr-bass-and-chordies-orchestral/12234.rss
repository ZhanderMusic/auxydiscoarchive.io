    <title>Do Something - eohr [bass and chordies/orchestral]</title>

    <description>https://soundcloud.com/eohr/do-something

I actually originally came up with this track because the arp in my track ([Flex](http://soundcloud.com/eohr/flex)) somehow got into a weird and different chord progression while I was messing around with it. Then I turned the main chords into that progression (at that point it was just Jelly, without the Plum and other instruments layered) and I made this out of that.

So this is basically a totally different Flex. With lots of fun orchestral stuff and piano cool chords I like music theory aaaaaah

Have fun listening, feedback appreciated.
