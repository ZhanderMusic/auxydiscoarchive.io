    <title>My Electron - 13 [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-electron-13-wip/6885</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been chewing on this one for a long time, and thought I&#39;d post a version. I want to see if you have any ideas on how to flesh out a track like this. What does it need? I feel like it has a pretty solid hook in the middle, but it just isn&#39;t close to finished. Any advice would be so appreciated. Thanks!
