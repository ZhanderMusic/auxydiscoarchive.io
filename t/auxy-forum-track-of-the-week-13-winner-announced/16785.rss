    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win. The judge this week is @AzureOnyx    

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/azureonyx">@AzureOnyx</a> has chosen the winner for Week <span class="hashtag">#13</span>‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Simon‚Äôs entry is this week‚Äôs winner. He perfectly uses the Panic Attack soundpack while keeping the sound signature of the overall song. Keeps the energy pumping while greatly using automation. Hard hitting percussion with synth highs while occupying stereo space rather than semi-stereo with more lighter songs. Buildups are leaning towards the generic side of EDM, the inclusion of Lobster from The Future soundpack sounds a bit out of place, but greatly appreciate the attempt of including it in the song. I‚Äôve personally used Lobster in my songs, definitely a hard sound to use, let alone master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congrats Simon!</p>
