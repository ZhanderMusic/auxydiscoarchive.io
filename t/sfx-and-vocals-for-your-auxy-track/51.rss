    <title>SFX and vocals for your Auxy track</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/sfx-and-vocals-for-your-auxy-track/51</link>
    <description>When it comes to music production, audio effects and vocals can really give your track that necessary boost in professionalism and sound quality. However, Auxy does not yet offer all of the features within the application that allows you to include these embellishments in your product. 

I strongly recommend Apple&#39;s GarageBand app for this. It&#39;s very easy to use, very versatile, and, in various ways, very powerful. If you want to go above and beyond with your Auxy track, I highly suggest you consider this platform. And the more you get to know GarageBand, the more advanced your productions will be - all while sticking to your mobile. 

If you need any tips or tricks or have any questions about adding effects and/or vocals to your Auxy production, post in this thread.</description>

            <p>To export into Logic Pro I usually, when exporting a project, tap the “export individual instruments” button, then share using airdrop. On my Mac I  then open the file, and put it in Finder.  After that I will go into logic pro, create as many audio tracks as I need, and then drag the audio files one by one from Finder into Logic Pro.  An alternative that I have not tried might be using iCloud Drive to accomplish the transfer from the iOS device to computer,  but when you’re uploading projects that have many tracks, that can be a lot of data to manage wirelessly.</p>

            <p>Use the export separate tracks and save to  Audioshare From there you can forward them to Auria easily.</p>

            <p>I import stems into Auria and mix there.  The effects &amp; processing options are a world better than GarageBand, IMO.  More expensive though!</p>

            <p>Do you think it’s possible that Auxy would some day support the new “Files” app in iOS11?  Being able to export a project or the stems to Files from Auxy would simplify a LOT of problems we now have to revert to the computer for.</p>

            <p>We’re not supporting Audiobus because we don’t want to invest in the case where you’re running multiple apps at the same time to make music. We know some people think that’s a good way to work, but we think it’s a mess to run apps simultaneously. And Audiobus doesn’t solve the problem of sending files back and forth, except you can record in other apps.</p>

            <p>There is a way to transfer your audio without confusion like reuploading and downloading from SoundCloud - check out AudioShare by Kymatica. It works really well!

            <p>But what if you export uncompressed audio and then pick “open in” Garageband or copy audio? Should be possible to somehow send the files directly. Or, when you import in Garageband, do you have the option to import from iCloud Drive? Then perhaps you could export the files and store them there.</p>

            <p>Yes, you would need a computer. I haven’t found a way to export directly to GarageBand yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Thanks for sharing! So you need a computer to download the files? What if you export files to Garageband directly from Auxy?</p>

            <p>I’ve been following the same process for a while now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you’re finished with your track in Auxy, export the track to Soundcloud as a private track</li>
<li>Download the track from Soundcloud (if you’re a Pro user, you can download the original file straight from the track editor / if you aren’t, you can enable downloads and then download the track from your feed)</li>
<li>Place the audio file directly onto your device (I do this directly through iTunes, dragging and dropping the file into a music playlist that I can easily find)</li>
<li>Open GarageBand and start a new project. The first “instrument” I open up is the audio recorder (make sure the filter is set to “Clean”). I adjust all the settings in the song file to match the settings of the track in Auxy (i.e. make sure the tempo and key is the same in GarageBand as it is in Auxy for that particular song)</li>
<li>Open up the main workstation and import the audio file</li>
<li>From there you can import more audio files if you have saved SFX or vocals in your Music as well, or you can record more SFX and vocals directly with your device</li>
<li>The rest of the features that you may use to alter your track are all up to trial and error <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
</ol>
