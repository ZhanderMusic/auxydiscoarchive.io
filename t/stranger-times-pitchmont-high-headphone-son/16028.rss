            <p>Thank you for the feedback! Ah yes, the corn horn. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"> I hoped to make it something like -starting with imperfect &gt; to less imperfect &gt; to even more imperfect.<br>
But it ended up a wreck. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

            <p>I think the saxophone entrance at 0:40 sounds a bit forced and out of place, the horn sound you used isn’t my favorite but the track is overall really cool because of where you take it and how the chords and melody evolve near the end. The abrupt end also doesn’t seem to fit to me but if you probably have a meaning behind it than I understand that’s cool</p>

            <p>I really liked your use of the “real” instruments (horns and etc), they sounded more natural than what I’ve done and heard in the past. Very nice!</p>
