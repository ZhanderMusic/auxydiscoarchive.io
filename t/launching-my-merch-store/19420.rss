In order to expand my brand, I&#39;ve launched a merch store on DesignByHumans. There is only one design available at the moment, but I have more on the way. Really excited even though I probably won&#39;t profit much. But hey, if you&#39;re a fan, why not buy some cool lookin&#39; clothes? I think a merch store is a great way to connect with your fans in a way that purchasing music doesn&#39;t. Because wearing a shirt with someone&#39;s name on it is a form of promotion. It can help you build your audience! 

However, I&#39;d only recommend doing this if you have a big enough following (I probably don&#39;t but oh well) and if you can get your design done from a trusted and quality source (I hired work from Fiverr). That&#39;s my input!</description>
