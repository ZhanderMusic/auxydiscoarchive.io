    <title>A question about cloud file management</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/a-question-about-cloud-file-management/11912</link>
    <description>I haven’t known that you could sort your iCloud samples into folders until recently.. 

I want to sort all of them into folders now. But im worried that it’s going to affect any drum kits that are already using the samples. I have a lot of unfinished projects with lots of samples, it would be a pain to have to re-find all the samples because they are in a different location.

Does sorting samples into different folders affect the drum kits?</description>

            <p>Yes, most definitely. You can also only go one sub folder down from the Samples folder.</p>
