    <description>Hey how’s it going? I was using auxy and thinking gosh I wish I could add more instruments to my project. And then it hit me why not limit the amount of loops you can put in a scene ![image|161x298](upload://eZO3iCJUqEWvBuPAXTo0Mi487MY.jpeg) 
but not limit the amount of instruments u can put in your projects. ![image|281x500](upload://pDYKqsOXyzPtUlhLaJFhjXgs6Z3.jpeg) That shouldn’t affect the cpu usage opposed to being able to use every instrument in each section.</description>

            <p>iPods have lower cpu usage then phones so I was suggesting that my iPod crashes as well if not more, not that you had an iPod touch. Lol no one has an iPod touch these days. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>Simply put, older devices can’t handle 20 instruments at the same time, especially if the automation is heavy. I’ve had that problem in Auxy 4 when all 16 slots were filled and the automation was heavy. Wasn’t a pleasant experience.</p>

            <p>Yeah I get what you mean although for me I feel is to much of a limiter and doesn’t let me bring my projects to it’s full potential. I’ve actually added more instruments through combining two projects.</p>

            <p>I feel like the limit helps me keep my songs simple and not over complicated, and with the new addition of the drum kit slots, I don’t really have a need for more instruments. I don’t know, just my opinion! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
