    <title>How to make a Soundcloud link appear in thread title</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-make-a-soundcloud-link-appear-in-thread-title/4383</link>
    <description>You may have noticed that some threads have a Soundcloud link in the title, like this: - 

![51 PM|690x60](upload://u5kEdypcDax5xKov40fzFJUEYpd.jpg)

If you click the button to create a new topic and then paste the Soundcloud URL into the thread title, it adds that link to the thread name.  

For the example above, I pasted the link in the title field, wrote some text below and then changed the thread title to &quot;Drone - MisterMaster&quot;, but when I created the thread, it remembered the URL. 

Although interestingly, I&#39;m unsure how to remove or edit that link once it&#39;s been posted.</description>
