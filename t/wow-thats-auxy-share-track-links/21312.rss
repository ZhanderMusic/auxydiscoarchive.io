    <title>&#39;Wow! That&#39;s Auxy!?&#39; Share track links</title>

    <description>Auxy tracks can often sound like, well, &#39;Auxy tracks&#39;.
Maybe it&#39;s the available sound packs or sound engine being so familiar, or maybe the mastering &#39;feel&#39;, or maybe the popularity of certain genres here has something to do with it.

It&#39;s great to hear tracks that you think really don&#39;t sound like &#39;Auxy tracks&#39; or that used Auxy for surprising genres.

What are the tracks that, if you didn&#39;t know, you wouldn&#39;t recognise as *#MadeWithAuxy*.

What are the tracks that have pushed further or in different directions…
and made you think…

            <p>Literally just stumbled on this. Thought it was interestingly outside of the usual Auxy space…</p>

<p>Production finish and mastering isn’t great, but…<br>
Hints of American minimalist and prog-jazz, with a retro / early '90s IDM / Black Dog production vibe.</p>
<p>Been through some more ‘sketches’ by that creator. I like their musical aesthetic.<br>
Outside what you normally hear with Auxy, imo.</p>
