            <p>honestly depending on what you are going for, Traction might be more important than ever. Knowing other labels similar to what you release (would like to release) is paramount to every point Arimyth made. For us it would be labels such as Sweet Tunes, Anti Fuguai, Assemblyline, Vale, etc. knowing (and sometimes working with) bigger labels could give you a boost in support. otherwise you have a standstill in growth. Also little tip, mixes are a good way to spotlight signed artists while giving a way for them to express.</p>

            <p>i’d recommend not limiting your releases to only auxy music. there’s a lot of people who use other daws that would be willing to release with you.</p>

            <p>I may want to start a collective. In fact, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/arimyth">@Arimyth</a>, thanks for the advice. I’ve been looking to see if there are people with styles similar to mine for years now… Especially on Auxy. I wish NewNames was still here. He’d be perfect.</p>

<p>A collective is essentially a joint artist union that has a similar function to a label, but without necessarily being a registered company. i.e., it’s a brand that releases music from other people, often a roster, and has promotional capabilities beyond each individual member (hence the “collective” nature of it).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would consider that a specific example of what a collective <em>might</em> do, rather than a definition.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think the wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_collective" rel="nofollow noopener">artist collective</a> sums it up better…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An artist collective is an initiative that is the result of a group of artists working together, usually under their own management, towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the artist, this can range from purchasing bulk materials, sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views or even living and working together as an extended family. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an association or a company.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fuujiya">@Fuujiya</a> What he’s saying is that you are unqualified to make a collective</p>
<p>Kidding, but it’s probably not worth the time &amp; effort. I know it can seem like a good idea when you think of a cool art concept or a cool name, but it’s a lot more than just that.</p>

        <title>How to build a collective?</title>

            <p>I see this question more often than one might expect and I think it’s because there’s a lot of confusion around what a collective actually is and why they’re important.</p>
<p>A collective is essentially a joint artist union that has a similar function to a label, but without necessarily being a registered company. i.e., it’s a brand that releases music from other people, often a roster, and has promotional capabilities beyond each individual member (hence the “collective” nature of it).</p>
<p>Depending on how long you’ve been around the community you’ve probably seen the rise and fall of many different collectives / labels. More often than not, this is due to insufficient planning beforehand on what running one would actually entail. Spoiler alert, running a collective is a fair amount of work if you’re doing it yourself (talent scouting, distribution, copyright protection, artwork, promotion, etc.)</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to have a specific purpose when making a collective; what vibe are you trying to create on that page? What kind of genres do you want to curate? Is there an extra function you want it to serve? For example, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/melolabel" rel="nofollow noopener">melo. </a> only accepts chill music, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fiverecords" rel="nofollow noopener">vvvvv</a> cultivates darker, more bass heavy tunes, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ridgelinesound" rel="nofollow noopener">Ridgeline</a> is dedicated to cataloging a collection of creative commons protected and easy to use music for content creators, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/auxycollective" rel="nofollow noopener">Auxy Collective</a> focuses on greater community interaction by only releasing megacollaborations, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you’re in a position (music wise) where you have the ability to gain sufficient traction on a track you release. Ordinarily it wouldn’t matter so much and it’d just be up to your commitment level, but when you start bringing <em>other</em> people into the picture and releasing <em>their</em> tracks, you have a greater level of responsibility to ensure those tracks do well and reach a certain audience.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Naming, artwork, and tracks to release are only a small part of building / running a collective, and if you’re aware of that and know the full extent to what it entails, go for it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=7" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Or <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stereofield">@stereofield</a>, I’d say he’s the resident expert on handling collectives. Alternatively, you could try talking to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/foryou">@foryou</a> but I don’t know if he frequents the disco anymore.</p>
