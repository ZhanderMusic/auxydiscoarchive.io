            <p>I forgot to say: your tracks/productions show a lot of potential. They have a good sound, and the melodic potential is also there. You could develop a whole lot, and be the next big producer. Just continue improving on the productions ‚Äì especially the arrangement (see my comment above).</p>

            <p>Hey Fabian</p>
<p>Since you‚Äôre asking for feedback, I‚Äôll give you some:)</p>
<p>This track has 3 parts, divided by the two breakdowns/drops. If you skip between these three sections, they are very similar.</p>
<p>There should be a build up of intensity. Else the listener/dancer/clubber has already got the payoff from the beginning.</p>
<p>Consider stuff like automating the reverb, so the melodic and harmonic sounds (not the percussion / drums) very slowly get more and more reverb, throughout the track.</p>
<p>Or add layers that play the same melodies, but with different sounds, so the main lead/melody gets more and more intense.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the book The Addiction Formula (also available as an AMAZING audiobook on Audible) ‚Äì it goes into exactly how to build up the energy and tension, throughout your tracks.</p>
