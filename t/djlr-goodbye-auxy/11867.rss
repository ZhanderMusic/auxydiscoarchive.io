    <title>DJLR - Goodbye Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/djlr-goodbye-auxy/11867</link>
    <description>Hey guys, today I’d like to make a quick goodbye and thank you speech. 

Dear Auxy, thank you for having me be apart of your app and a member of the community. Without Auxy, I would have never picked up music or even been interested in creating it. I had always been musical, but until I discovered Auxy (by accident in 2014 November (when it first launched) ), I never knew I had these capabilities of creating music or having virtuosic musical skills. It has opened up a H U G E pathway for me and I have learned the basics of structuring a song and putting together my ideas into making full tracks. However, I have always struggled to be able to implement my full ideas into my music due to the limitations and restrictions that Auxy does not offer. 

From the day I used Auxy, I have never been taught anything and I have never wanted to learn anything externally or from anyone else. I started off with making random note placements and having no idea what so ever of music composition or production. I have picked up everything on my own and although it took longer for me to become better at music, it was worth it. Because teaching myself and not learning from anyone else has boosted my innovative ideas and allowed me to be unique from the rest.

Thank you for letting me start somewhere and building a small crowd to get me started off into the world of music. 

Keep opening up pathways of upcoming musicians/producers. You certainly done a great job with me and I’m so thankful for everything Auxy has offered. 

Unfortunately my journey with Auxy of almost 4 years has come to an end, as my dream of owning FL Studio has finally come, and now the possibilities and options I have with fl studio will take me to new places and hopefully I’ll be able to live the dream I’ve always dreamed since the beginning of my music creation journey. I dream to be famous and stand in front of 10,000 people playing my music to everyone who loves me. And I know I’ll get there because I believe in myself, and I am not a quitter. I know I can do this and I will prove to everyone that music is no fun and games to me. I am determined to fulfill my dreams and by succeeding and putting effort in I improve each time, and with the capabilities I have, in sure it’s possible. 

Some quick advice before I go:

Live the dream you want to live, whether it’s music, writing books, helping animals whatever. If you put effort, time and practice into something, you will achieve things all the time. Maybe not straight away but everyone picks up things at different paces. For me, I’m a fast learner. I hope you all get to live your dream one day and I know you can do it! Never give up because the adventures and gateways life offers are amazing, and if you don’t put anything into it, you’ll be left in the dark. You gotta work your way up the ladder.
 
I’d also like to thank all my fans who have supported me from day 1. Without any of you, I wouldn’t have gotten as far as I have today. As I said, it took me longer than most of you to get recognised. I started in November 2014 and only got noticed by September of 2017. So thank you to all my fans who support me and my music. 

Some auxians I’d like to thank:

@Eswyn @Xiejra @HELIXX @Matik . Thank you for being supportive of me and my music and creating friendships with me. 

This has been a great journey, and I can’t wait to start a new one with FL Studio. 

Thanks for having me Auxy.

            <p>Auxy is just a plugin at its core dude (it’s intended as a complementary tool), I own everything you do and I am still here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=6" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"> Exporting individual sounds and drum loops is super useful so you can add them to your tracks. Sometimes I dedicate days to making samples in Auxy so I can export them to Logic and use them in my songs. All the exporting features of Auxy are underrated.</p>

            <p>I just upgraded to Live 10 suite and I LOVE Wavetable! I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dj_la_rocca">@DJ_La_Rocca</a> about Auxy’s limitations but I do like the sounds it has. So I believe that it doesn’t have to be putting aside music apps  or labeling apps as a level of music production. Yes, Auxy is a way to create music with a simple user interface but it’s more approachable to people who don’t know how or where to start. Once you have mastered the app and produced some material you think is great, keep making more music on the app or augment to your creativity. You recently got a DAW, great! That is something to augment to your creativity. TLDR; don’t set aside things based on level. Sure your moving platforms to create music but now you have more tools to make more interesting tracks with plenty of sounds to utilize.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty familiar with the Fl Studio Layout, if your u need help with side chaining or something, you can ask me or just google it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=6" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> like I did. After a week of Using it, it should become easier! Anything Involving Creating Synths I can help with as well, so if you need help on that you can hmu. I also can screen share on skype if that helps</p>

            <p>Awww you were my favorite. But it’s your choice, anyways. I’d like to say I’m a good fan of your music. Also thanks to you for your tutorials actually. To be honest, those tutorials actually helped me ALOT, because i kept watching them to see where your mind was at, and i learned chord proggresions from you. senpai don leav</p>
<p>Make sure you show us your music from FL studio <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I think with software, music production has become so easy and accessible that we’ve moved past the point of sheer convenience and deep into the territory of “damn there’s a lot of STUFF here to deal with”. Which is why I’ve steadfastly been whittling down the number of tools I use for a given track and thus gravitated away from “professional” daws.  It’s just too much.</p>
<p>I’m at the point now where when I hear talk of “professional” this or that with music production workflow, i automatically assume “oh, you mean making music in the slowest way possible with 5 times as many tools as necessary?”</p>
<p>Which is why <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a>, if there is to be a bright future for music software, and I think there is, then speed of production is to be the name of the game.  How can we get the music out faster?  One way of course is to have a really great live recording and playing system <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=6" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>The ironic part is the setup and troubleshooting going into doing the task that the application is supposed to do <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> this is where iOS is a double edged sword. You (the collective you/us) want a file system and flexibility but at the  same time don’t want to have to deal with libraries and paths and setup and on Windows the registry and etc etc etc. The most complex it gets on iOS is “Do I have the audio unit installed that this project uses?” - but I don’t have to worry about WHERE it’s installed, just whether or not it is.</p>

            <p>Even though I didn’t listen you La Rocca’s music much, I liked what I heard a lot. I hope you continue to make great music and have fun with it. Sad to see you go!</p>

<p>I think that because the workflow of iOS is kind of garbage (and it’s gotten exponentially better, but it’s still rough) people (myself included) are looking to keep things in the box as much as possible. As soon as you start needing to involve too many apps and crazy workarounds the workflow ends up taking more time than just writing music, which is what I want to do.</p>

<p>Totally agree!</p>
