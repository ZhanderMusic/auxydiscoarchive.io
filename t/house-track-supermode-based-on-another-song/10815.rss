    <title>House Track Supermode - based on another song</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/house-track-supermode-based-on-another-song/10815</link>
    <description>Hey guys... if your a house fan... you should know a song called supermode - tell me why.

Well, I just found out that is a rip off of an 80’s song called small town boy by bronski beat.

I never knew that it was a rip off</description>

            <p>Not sure I’d call it a rip-off, per se.</p>
<p>Rip-off suggests them trying to trick people, when they’ve not really done anything that music hasn’t been doing for decades – sampling, covering, remaking, interpolating, …</p>

            <p>Many songs are actually rip-offs in some way. If something works, it’s good to use again. There’s a lot of nuance involved of course, but yeah. Inspiration takes many forms it seems ;3</p>
