    <title>Problems validating subscription</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/problems-validating-subscription/15210</link>
    <description>So I just updated to the latest Auxy today (previously on v5.1) and since then have noticed an unusual yet consistent bug. Every time I open Auxy and then exit it, the subscription will toggle states from the previous time I had opened the app. So for example, if I had the subscription and then closed the app (not force quit necessarily) and then reopened it even a minute later, all the sounds would show as locked and restore purchases will show nothing that needs to be restored. Closing and then immediately reopening it would return it to the subscription state. 

The bug inherently has a workaround so it&#39;s tolerable but it&#39;s incredibly annoying when trying to use other apps along with Auxy. I was wondering if anyone else had this and if they had found a fix.

Cheers :clinking_glasses:

            <p>I wrote to forum to poll the crowd on whether it was common / uncommon and tangentially whether anyone had discovered any fixes for it. Will definitely make sure to email you guys directly in addition to that next time. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for reporting, although it’s better that you email us directly than writing in the forum. We have made some changes to how the app handles “restore purchases” so this might be related to that. Will tell Fredrik to invest.</p>

            <p>Well, before we can fix any problem we need to know that it exists, so it’s always a good idea to contact support when something like this happens instead of finding a workaround.</p>

            <p>What do you mean? Could you send an email to support from within the app and explain how the song got lost? Shouldn’t happen obviously.</p>

<p>Definitely worth sending email to <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a>. If you do it from the app (Subscription at bottom &gt; Contact Support) it will send a log too.</p>

            <p>I’ve had that same exact problem not too long ago. It’s best if you directly email staff about this, as doing so will provide them a log file that contains analytical data that that affected device records. Ultimately, this can help solve your problem.</p>

            <p>I keep getting this error once every month when my subscription renews, it says I don’t have it when I obviously do. Sometimes this fixes itself over time, sometimes I have to cancel the subscription and sub to get the sounds. All and all, it’s really annoying. If this could be your main priority first that would be amazing! <img src="/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
