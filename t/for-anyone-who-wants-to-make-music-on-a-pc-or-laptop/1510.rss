            <p>I mean rn? I don’t really like it all that much. I just wanted other people to hear what I remember hearing in the years I was on it. Also soundation does NOT have an app since I specified in the title: “For anyone who wants to make music on a PC or Laptop” implying that.</p>

            <p>I was just curious to hear more thoughts on it then. There are tons of different apps out there but I’m always interested in hearing if people find specific things that they really like etc.</p>
