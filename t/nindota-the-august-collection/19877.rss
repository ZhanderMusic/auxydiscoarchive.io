    <title>Nindota - The August Collection</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/nindota-the-august-collection/19877</link>
    <description>I listened back on about 220 of my tracks yesterday, and decided to upload 41 of them to YouTube.
The first 5 tracks were made in Garageband, but the rest were made entirely in Auxy, with the oldest track dating all the way back to early December 2019.
