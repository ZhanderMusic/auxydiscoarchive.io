    <title>Track of the Week... is coming. Mini brain dump here please!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/track-of-the-week-is-coming-mini-brain-dump-here-please/18852</link>
    <description>The April Fool&#39;s day competition is closed - congratulations to @cursed, a unicorn has been distributed and the [Auxy Forum Unicorn Hall of Fame](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-unicorn-hall-of-fame/5411) has been updated accordingly. 

I&#39;ve been thinking about unicorns and track of the week for some time now. There are some changes I&#39;d like to implement, but I&#39;m also open to feedback and would like to know your thoughts (after all, this is a community, not a dictatorship). 

The unicorns are becoming a bit watered down. I don&#39;t want to eliminate them, or start consolidating them, but I believe I&#39;d like to reserve these for the major tournaments. If @DHO will have it, or perhaps others, or multiple people, I think it should be a twice a year thing. If everyone has a unicorn, there&#39;s no value. So it needs to be reserved for very special, big events.

Regarding track of the week, I&#39;m worried that there is going to be a problem of people having a ridiculous amount of discs next to their name. My initial thought was that we could use :cd: x (number), but it&#39;s not quite as visually appealing. After thinking on it some more, this is what I&#39;ve come up with:

Similar to how record sales work in various countries, x amount of ToTW&#39;s earned will earn you different *types* of &quot;certifications&quot; - for every five :cd:&#39;s, you get a :dvd:. For each five :dvd: you have earned :minidisc:. If someone has more than five :minidisc:, I&#39;m going to have to start putting x 6, 7 etc. But that&#39;s A LOT OF WINS.

I&#39;d like opinions on this. I&#39;d like for people to be more engaged and supportive of each other, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a silver bullet, but it&#39;s a start maybe. Remember - you will get out of this what you put into it.

If everyone is mostly on board with these changes (you can&#39;t please everyone!) I will retroactively convert multiple disc winners (I believe there is only one person eligible right now) to the next level and will likely continue to update the existing hall of fame.

Looking forward to your thoughts. Tentative start for first ToTW is May 1. Thanks!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The April Fool’s day competition is closed - congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cursed">@cursed</a>, a unicorn has been distributed and the <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-unicorn-hall-of-fame/5411">Auxy Forum Unicorn Hall of Fame</a> has been updated accordingly.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about unicorns and track of the week for some time now. There are some changes I’d like to implement, but I’m also open to feedback and would like to know your thoughts (after all, this is a community, not a dictatorship).</p>
<p>The unicorns are becoming a bit watered down. I don’t want to eliminate them, or start consolidating them, but I believe I’d like to reserve these for the major tournaments. If <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dho">@DHO</a> will have it, or perhaps others, or multiple people, I think it should be a twice a year thing. If everyone has a unicorn, there’s no value. So it needs to be reserved for very special, big events.</p>
<p>Regarding track of the week, I’m worried that there is going to be a problem of people having a ridiculous amount of discs next to their name. My initial thought was that we could use <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:"> x (number), but it’s not quite as visually appealing. After thinking on it some more, this is what I’ve come up with:</p>
<p>Similar to how record sales work in various countries, x amount of ToTW’s earned will earn you different <em>types</em> of “certifications” - for every five <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:">'s, you get a <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/dvd.png?v=9" title=":dvd:" class="emoji" alt=":dvd:">. For each five <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/dvd.png?v=9" title=":dvd:" class="emoji" alt=":dvd:"> you have earned <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/minidisc.png?v=9" title=":minidisc:" class="emoji" alt=":minidisc:">. If someone has more than five <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/minidisc.png?v=9" title=":minidisc:" class="emoji" alt=":minidisc:">, I’m going to have to start putting x 6, 7 etc. But that’s A LOT OF WINS.</p>
<p>I’d like opinions on this. I’d like for people to be more engaged and supportive of each other, and I don’t think it’s a silver bullet, but it’s a start maybe. Remember - you will get out of this what you put into it.</p>
<p>If everyone is mostly on board with these changes (you can’t please everyone!) I will retroactively convert multiple disc winners (I believe there is only one person eligible right now) to the next level and will likely continue to update the existing hall of fame.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your thoughts. Tentative start for first ToTW is May 1. Thanks!</p>
