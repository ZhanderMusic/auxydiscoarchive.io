&lt;hr&gt;

Hello, I&#39;m writing as a paying customer of Auxy who did not receive any new sounds in the previous month, September. According to the [subscription FAQ page](http://auxy.co/subfaq.html), the subscription includes &quot;new sounds each month.&quot; 

**Where are the sounds for September?**</description>

<p>When we write “new sounds monthly”, we refer to a release pace that is around 30 days in between packs. Sometimes it will be shorter and sometimes a bit longer. I.e. not necessarily one pack every calendar month, but you should expect ca 12 packs in total over the course of a year.</p>
<p>For this pack, we had to get the app update out since the new sounds will use some new features in the engine.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think that answers OPs question.</p>

            <p>A short announcement that the sound pack would be delayed due to the development of the update would have definitely cleared the air</p>

<p>Agreed, I totally get it. Just that there was no official announcement or agreement besides the FAQ which had information that is no longer accurate</p>
