    <title>Mission Control - KieranHarrison [Auxy &amp; Ableton]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/mission-control-kieranharrison-auxy-ableton/14832</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had some time off from the Auxy Disco - due to starting a new job and also getting my teeth stuck into Ableton Live more.  

So, for the first time I have just finished a song that was mainly conceived and formed in Auxy, then arranged and mixed/mastered in Ableton (with some smaller elements and layering also being added in Ableton.)

Any feedback on this would be class. Enjoy.
