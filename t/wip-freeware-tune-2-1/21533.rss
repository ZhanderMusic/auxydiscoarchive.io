This is actually a mix of 3 ideas/tracks,
1 up to 2.17
2 from to 2.17-7.10
3 form to ~7.10/7.11-end

About:
This is still ongoing project, idea behind - to create complete &#39;mature&#39; track with free version of Auxy, and those few basic instruments avalable in free mode.
Actually limitations became opportunity to play with effects and options to gain better sounds, change this basic stuff so it would sound in acceptable manner. 
Enjoy!

Please remember to leave comments, here or directly at the Soundcloud!

Thanks to your feedback I can learn new things! 
&amp; also check my other stuff!
