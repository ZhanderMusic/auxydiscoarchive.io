&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #26: @SpaghettiSauce   &lt;/big&gt; 
 
 &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt;paghettiSauce is a young American artist, who says he plays trumpet and fiddles around on the piano badly. 

**Piano?** 
&quot;I have a keyboard with the off button not working, so I have to unplug it whenever I want to turn it off. Even though I have to do that, I still use it a lot.&quot;  

**What&#39;s your fav genre?**
&quot;Just make stuff. My favorite genre is music.&quot;

**If you could collab with any artist in the world?** 
 &quot;Herbie Hancock. Probably not the best choice but it would be fun, mixing electronic with jazz, and maybe teaching him a little.&quot;   :joy:

 **Week starting: 25 June, 2018.**

            <p>Hey Spag-man <img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/auxy/original/2X/f/f41aed367af0ff701e79526f0bbe33fbbfc24c5f.png?v=5" title=":spag:" class="emoji emoji-custom" alt=":spag:"> ,</p>
<p>Just listed to a bunch of your tracks. My favourite parts were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The atmosphere and bass in  2-16-05</li>
<li>The chords in Radiance</li>
<li>The Intro and dramatic parts of Synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of times there was too much repetition.  Like, when a new section of the track starts you do a transition and introduce new sounds which is good, but exactly the same melody keeps playing throughout. Maybe you could copy the melody and make a few more versions of it instead of using exactly the same melody pattern over and over. It’s actually quite fun to turn off your melody altogether - even if it’s good and try making variations of whole new melodies. Maybe the next step in your musical journey is to investigate song structure, which is something I need to improve on.</p>
<p>Thanks for being our FMOTW.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/spaghettisauce">@SpaghettiSauce</a>! I’m currently in the process of listening to your tracks, and I’d just like to say that I’ve noticed your mixes getting a lot more full and interesting. I’ve really liked the development of your tracks! I love the chords and arpeggios of Oxygen. Has a great vibe to it - simple but pretty. One of my favorites is 2-16-05. Amazing work with that. The bass that kicks in is just perfect. The nice little melody is short but sweet. Overall a very simple yet stunning track. I love the ambient progressive feel of it. It sounds like something I would enjoy making, so if you’re ever up to collaborate on some ambient house-y stuff… let me know. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  I love the path you’re taking with you’re new stuff, and I’m excited to hear more! Keep up the cool chords, too. They’re great. Congrats on FMotW, and keep on writing great stuff!</p>

Compare to old stuff, I can see your skills are improving! melodies are not too plain, more dynamic, and I see solid structure.<br>

Ok, first of all, I think you really improved over the last few months. Radiance is significantly ‘better’ than the stuff you uploaded like 6 months ago, so good job on that! I noticed that you make different styles and genres of music, which is great. My favorite track of yours is definitely Radiance; the intro is great, and I really like the experimental wubs in the drop, and the little plucks at the end of the drop work really well too, and the same goes for the vocal, that’s dope. Unfortunately I didn’t really have time to listen to all of your songs, so I can’t really give you a lot of feedback. I do feel that the drop in Coco Beach lacks power, so it could use a little sub bass imo.<br>
Overall, you make solid music, and you’re great as a person too, so keep it up my man!</p>

            <p>I never really listened to your stuff until now, and I have to say, I’m pleasantly surprised! Your synth work in Radiance is impressive.  No offense, but you seem to have a tendency to keep scenes the same for a bit too long without making changes, but that’s an easy fix. I left you some other comments on Soundcloud which you can check out. Thanks for being FMOTW!</p>

            <p>I like your drums from all your songs.</p>
<p>I think you might want to add some more meat (bass) on your drops tho.</p>
<p>Overall I really like your style, and see a lot of potential in your music👍</p>
<p>My personal favorite song of yours is coco beach.</p>
