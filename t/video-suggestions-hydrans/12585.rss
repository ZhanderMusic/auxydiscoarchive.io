    <title>Video Suggestions - HYDRANS</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/video-suggestions-hydrans/12585</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! 

I have been thinking about starting up a YouTube Channel for my songs, as well as music-related videos and tutorials. I already have a video in the making, but I was wondering what the community would want to see.

Some ideas I had were
~ Track Deconstructions of my popular songs (let me know which ones you would want to see)
~ Demonstrations on how to make certain styles
~ Creating a song from scratch
~ Showing how to make certain drumkits or sounds
~ Q&amp;A through Discord

If you have other ideas, let me know, and if you like any of the ideas up here, let me know as well so I can follow up with a video!

Thanks!
