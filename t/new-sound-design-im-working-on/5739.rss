    <title>New sound design im working on</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-sound-design-im-working-on/5739</link>
    <description>so i pretty much picked up Electronic music when i was about 9 or 10 and i was never satisfied with the modern pop music around that time 5 years on ive used synths to create new sounds mainlt including basses and other sound effects. 
unfortunately after my computer broke 1 year ago (and still havent gotten a new one) i have been stuck in one place. thats when i found Auxy of July last year. i got to grips with various instruments and after the automation update i have really gotten to grips with making similar sounding or new sounding sound design. a track im working on heavily focuses on using these techniques and i encourage everyone else to go out of their comfort zone and try something new. 
i havent heard these techniques used in anyone else tracks yet and i think that everyone else can try to. 

the most popular theme right now is seemingly future bass but id like to see a lor more diverse genres, my favourite being neuro bass which i myself like to think i create. 

anyway i just want to see more variety and interesting sounds in tracks today. if anyone knows anyone like this then let me know ;}

            <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I’ve experimented a lot, and someone helped me out too. But, there are ways to make Neuro basses.<br>
Since a few weeks ago my dnb style completely changed because Hexx found out a way to make Reese/Neuro basses, by using sweet spring, pitch all the way down, and bitcrusher, also some chorus.<br>
I like to layer it with sweet saw and mix it the exact way as I do with sweet spring.<br>
Needy can be a very good second Neuro bass, so for example the first 2 bars sweet spring and saw, and the third and fourth needy, with pitch to make it interesting.<br>
I’ll try to find more neuro basses so more updates might be coming <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Oh also doing 2 octaves of a sound gives it a sort of tube distortion effect, especially with Racer n Beam</p>

            <p>Just found out, breath on the second lowest octave sounds kinda like a neuro bass, maybe with some mixing and layering it will sound exactly like neuro.</p>

            <p>I’ve listened to your tracks, they both sound really nice. That second one sounds pretty interesting, I really like all the stuff that’s going on on the drop, lots of effects and some nice basses</p>

            <p>I thought you meant gritty with the boom basses I’m sorry​:joy:<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">. But I agree, I think basses from the future sound pack and basses like racer are the best basses for neuro in auxy.</p>

            <p>Back when I used Auxy, My go too “gritty” basses where mainly Racer, beam, Lobster puma and a couple others I think. Best example(s) of where I used these are probably in my tracks Berries: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/berries" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/berries</a> and false face:<a href="https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/false-face" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/xiejramusic/false-face</a><br>

<p>100% agreed, I definitely do this as well (never passing about 25% highpass). It doesn’t need a lot, subtle is very good here.</p>

            <p>I was gonna @ Xiejra haha, but didn’t wanna be bothersome. The stuff I’ve heard him do is quite similar to what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>SeamlessR is a pretty cool guy to watch stuff from, this video actually shows a pretty smart way of doing this, that you could do in Auxy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVWPIJrLmVg" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVWPIJrLmVg</a></p>
<p>The biggest <em>problem</em> though is that if you are gonna split the one sound into four different frequency spectra, you’re gonna use up four different instrument slots… so that’s a bummer. But the way he does his here could totally work in Auxy.</p>

            <p>This is the sub genre of Dnb that I struggle with, I’m sure you can probably get the sound by utilising other apps and twisting the sounds on Auxy.</p>

            <p>Experiment with very gritty sounding basses, and low pass filtering. Also slight highpassing the sound makes it a little bit more “vocal”. Thats how I would have gone about it</p>

            <p>Agreed, sounds like two different bass sounds playing two separate notes (maybe 5ths or octave?). They might be having similar automations. I took a quick listen and that was my first though: Two different basses. Unsure about Auxy instrument names can’t help there lol, they’re too wacky.</p>

            <p>It sounds quite complex so you’ll definitely need multiple basses/ a lot of automation</p>

            <p>1 piece of the bass sounds like freak with low pass to me, not quite sure. I also hear some glitchy stuff so maybe bitty with low notes too?</p>

<p>This is the kind of bass that I’m talking about, obviously I understand that I probably won’t be able to get something as good as this but I’m looking to develop a close sounding neuro bass, Amy ideas guys?</p>

            <p>I’ve just stumbled across this post, I’ve been trying to create neuro bass in the style of Noisia, Mefjus, Phace etc in Auxy for a while but with no joy, anyone have any tips?</p>

            <p>yes. ive found many instruments that sound very interesting when pushed incredibly low. my favourites being Puma and Lobster in “The future”. resembles some what of a SNAILS reese. when automating pitch and highpass filter you can get Growl sounds too</p>
