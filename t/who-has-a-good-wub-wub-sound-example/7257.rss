    <title>Who has a good wub wub sound example?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/who-has-a-good-wub-wub-sound-example/7257</link>
    <description>So some (by some I mean very little lol) people know I mainly make HipHop/ rap and now dance/funk beats. I haven’t really ventured into the whole future beat genre or whatever wubs fall into- recently I was contacted to make a beat like this one song, and it has a light wub effect in a smooth melody. I can link the song below if you’d like- but I was wondering if someone can lead me to a good example of how a wub drop should sound..? I’m learning this as fast as I can do help would be appreciated!</description>
