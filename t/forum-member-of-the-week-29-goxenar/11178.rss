&lt;big&gt; Featured Auxy Artist #29: @Goxenar   &lt;/big&gt; 


 &lt;big&gt;G&lt;/big&gt;oxenar is based in TEXAS, where he writes music, raps, beatboxes and sometimes sings.  When I started writing this introduction, I wanted to provide a link to his collab with Hayvn, which he rapped on, as I remember enjoying it and being surprised there&#39;s not more of his rapping released, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t appear to be posted anymore. 

The GOX&#39;s recent music is tagged as dubstep, brostep, trapstep, trap, EDM, electronic and dance. In 2017, he released the [G.O.X.Y.](https://soundcloud.com/goxenar/sets/motivations) EP, with his [Innovations of art](https://soundcloud.com/goxenar/sets/innovations-of-art) album following in 2018. 

&gt; &quot;I’m a major perfectionist, until in my SOUL it’s perfected, I will NOT officially finish it. :skull: :skull: :joy: :joy:&quot;

Latest collaborators include Hayvn, Andrew Adams &amp; Austin Haga, plus a few remixes.  

[Check out his music!](https://www.soundcloud.com/goxenar/tracks ) and leave some feedback here. 
 
 **Week starting: 16 July, 2018.** 
 - Please listen to at least one of his tracks (or more) 
 - Provide at least one Soundcloud comment / feedback about his music during their week. 
 - Comment in this thread once you&#39;ve provided any feedback. 
 - If you want to be featured, remember to comment for others.

<p>Your one of my favorite auxy producers<br>
And my favorite songs of yours are voices and funkin.<br>
I really like the synth sound you used in voices it’s really heavy and just feels good. Funkin just had the coolest effects and sounds that worked so well together.</p>
<p>For constructive feedback…</p>
<p>I noticed on 8 bit love there wasn’t much bass in the drop. And I think it would sound better if you added maybe my beam or subway with low Lowpass following the root note of the chord.</p>

<p>I like all of your tracks. Probably because you take your time before releasing them, so they’re perfectly ripe and juicy.</p>
<p>Your tracks contain positive messages.  I can see why you put the heart in your logo.</p>
<p>And your lyrics and vocal samples are simple, yet effective. Not over-done.</p>
<p>Don’t really have any constructive feedback, except to say keep them coming!</p>
<p>Some specific bits I enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reason I Breathe  -   Sweet lyrics and vocal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funkin’ -  That bass line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t Judge - Grabbed me right from the start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell Me - Vocal effects. Kinda blended into sounding like an instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Wave -  When the drums kick around 3/4 mark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change it up -  That sample’s a crack up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8-Bit Love - Sweeper/drum transition and the lead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being our FMOTW,  G.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/goxenar">@Goxenar</a>, thanks for your help with my “dubstep” track, and I really enjoyed your track, “The Reason I Breathe”! Really awesome wubs, and both drops were amazing! Nice singing as well! I will say, maybe adding in a little tone difference over the main lyrical channel, could have made the singing sound a bit more epic. Overall though, great job! I wish you the best in your future music career!</p>

I’m a big fan of your style man, it’s really impressive and one of the most unique styles in this community. I can’t imagine how much effort you put into your music, it seems really complex. All of your tracks are full of energy, just the way I like it; especially those bass heavy electro tracks are lit. I think Lightning Round and Funkin’ are my favorite tracks of yours, but everything else is really good too. Judging from your upload schedule it’s definitely quality over quantity for you, which is awesome. This pays off in the sense that I can’t really point out something for you to improve on. Please keep on making this awesome kind of music <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Keep it up man!<br>
Btw, it’s awesome that you sing as well.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much. That truly means a lot!</p>
<p>Fun fact: When I submitted my entry for BTC <span class="hashtag">#24</span> I felt quite discouraged from being chosen because most of the music produced through Auxy back then was Future Bass or “Chill” vibes. I chose to be myself and simply post it regardless of the outcome. I was super happy to know it was enough to be chosen within the BTC <span class="hashtag">#24</span> “winners.”</p>

<p>Love your style, love your ideas, love your stuff</p>

            <p>ok so heres my feedback here (left some on sc too):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So I like the approach you took with “The Reason I Breathe”, im personally not religious but im happy to see that members of this community can share their beliefs without backlash. Keep on mixing and don’t let anyone mess with you because of beliefs <span class="hashtag">#offtopicsorry</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Do or Die!” is amazing especially with the false end and the vocal samples, i don’t usually like stuff that heavy and hard but i make exceptions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>“Funkin’” is my jam and currently one of my favorite Auxy songs, one piece of criticism though, in the song you took a triplet theme but in the middle build you used drums in sequences aligned with 1/16 rather than 1/12 along with the triplets already happening I the chords. other than that I think it would be cool with a triplet drum build, i really enjoy it!</li>
</ul>
<p>i hope to be hearing more great things from you soon!</p>
