    <title>All demo project remixes?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/all-demo-project-remixes/8051</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if I could make an album of all the sound pack demos remixed by me? Since there was no demo for boom bass (that will be hard!) or destiny, I will make these ones up. But am I allowed to make remixes of Grand Pianos, 7 Skies Selection, Sound of Vivrant, RAC Essentials, Vintage Keys, The Future, Melodic Percussion and Acoustic Guitars? In the album description and the track descriptions I will acknowledge @Auxy  (or if you didn’t make all of them then the people who did make them).
Also, I know many people have been asking about these but those were individual, this is for all of them.
Thanks,
Mr Mooo</description>
