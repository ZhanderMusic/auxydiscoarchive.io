    <title>Include automation in MIDI export</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/include-automation-in-midi-export/1409</link>
    <description>I tend to do my songs on Auxy then bring MIDIs over to other software for additional instrument choices. But my songs usually tend to have quite a bit of automation but it doesn&#39;t get added in with the MIDI. Am I doing something wrong or is this just a feature that hasn&#39;t been added yet?</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/arimyth">@Arimyth</a> if you still have that .ipa of the older MIDI-capable release, I’d appreciate it if you’d DM me a link. Will I still need to pay the subscription fee for Auxy Premium if I want to use the MIDI out control features?</p>

            <p>Thank you for all the suggestions!<br>
So far, Genome Sequencer looks the most interesting to me.<br>
On a somewhat related note, I wanted to say, that I just discovered Sonic Pi and it looks like it’s exactly what I’m looking for (though not a mobile app).<br>
To anyone who’s interested in coding music, I would say to check it out. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>Some good sequencer apps with midi out  for controlling synths:  Groove Rider,  Xequence.  There’s also Infinite Looper, Klimper, the big iPad DAWS, and many more I’m not remembering. You just gotta search around in the App Store for “midi sequencer”, “music sequencer”, etc and so on</p>

            <p>There are some, most of them that support core midi also support midi out to other apps. A few years back there was one called Genome sequencer, was pretty cool. No idea if it survived the 32 bit appocalypse <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Apps like Cubasis do, I would bet Auria Pro does. Nanostudio I think did. That’s about all I got off the top of my head</p>

I’m looking forward to trying it.<br>
I really don’t understand why there aren’t any apps out there doing just that, just a simple sequencer to use with MIDI, it seems like such a good idea.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/arimyth">@Arimyth</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/akabillposters">@akabillposters</a>! I’ll carefully look at my app collection and update to the latest ios soon.</p>
<p>I hope you get the original Auxy running phenylalanine. It really is a gem in the ios platform. I really can’t praise it enough - there doesn’t seem to be anything else like it.</p>
<p>I wish Auxy would hand over the original app to another developer to keep it alive, and tweak/fix some of the things they changed/stuffed up towards the end of its development. The original Auxy must live on. For the sake of easy yet extremely powerful music production!</p>

            <p>I wish I could get a hold of the original Auxy. Apparently, it was exactly what I was looking for when I found Auxy, a sequencer app that could control a synth.<br>
I’m so disappointed that I missed out on it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>

<p>As a personal opinion, I would weigh the cost of updating to keeping an app which you really like. Depending on your current iOS (if it’s 10.2+) app compatibility will still be decent and you will have access to all 32 bit apps (includes the original Alchemy synth for mobile). So just decide how much you value the original Auxy.</p>

            <p>Hi all, I’m one of the original Auxy users (been in it for the long haul!) but haven’t engaged in the Auxy Disco forum, until now.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been reluctant to update my iPad to ios 11 because I recall seeing something about the orignal Auxy (Green) being dropped from development. Is this the case? Does the original Auxy work on the current ios?</p>
<p>I use both Auxy apps for different purposes. The original Auxy is one of my core go-to apps for jamming because of the midi functionality. A mate and I create the most epic sounds in mountain huts; we each use Auxy Green through synths, sequencing in Auxy on the fly and then playing with synth settings (Synthmaster is my favourite). The results are truly remarkable.</p>
<p>If I didn’t have access to this… I would be extremely unhappy… and thus my reluctance to update. So, is the original Auxy still operational?</p>
<p>Auxy 1 with midi is incredible. If the developers are unwilling to support it I’d like to see someone replicate the original app for ios 11 so this gem is not lost to the ios music-making world.</p>

            <p>Would a MIDI be able to be manually connected to Auxy? I’m currently going to use one but I was unsure if it worked or not. Can anyone help me out with that?</p>

            <p>All we ask for, and I suppose might be the most important, is that you can import midi files (your favorite chord progression stored on your computer or from another app) and record midi outputs (keyboard you connect through usb or bluetooth). Yes, we might be a little bit niche within the Auxy community, but your thesis clearly stated your belief that mobile music making was the next generation, and it is. But to persuade the traditional artists, this may be a necessity. Not only because this pseudo DAW has a workflow that needs several improvements, but also because it has severe and explicit limitations. By adding this support you may be able to persuade a wider audience that this is the future. Imagine a guy on his morning one hour commute, with no time to sit down at his PC after a long day of his part time job and college hours. He carries his small 25 key piano keyboard in his backpack and his iPad Pro, because he has no other time. So he takes it out and places it on his lap and begins working. Not only is he a testament to others who hear his work and are facing similar issues, but also to commuters who might want to know how it is possible that he is making hits on a train with a keyboard and a tablet.</p>

            <p>I second this motion. I’ve found it hard to compose sometimes in Auxy and perhaps some import of note data would be helpful for this.</p>

<p>You don’t need to with Audiobus 3 MIDI!  You just load your input app or plug in your hardware controller, select Auxy and it automatically works as expected!</p>

            <p>Audiobus3 MIDI input is an obvious fit for Auxy.  Output would be fantastic but doesn’t fit with its present vision so well as input.</p>
