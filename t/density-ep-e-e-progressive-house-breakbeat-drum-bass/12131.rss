    <title>Density [EP] - E/E [Progressive House, Breakbeat, Drum &amp; Bass]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/density-ep-e-e-progressive-house-breakbeat-drum-bass/12131</link>
    <description>https://open.spotify.com/album/2US7Ay6nXbBnbdXVFj9dcb

iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/density-ep/1435824542

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/sets/density

It&#39;s been a very long time coming, but I&#39;ve finally gotten myself to a point where I feel confident enough in releasing something onto streaming services. Introducing Density, a rework playlist of a few songs into a higher quality format and fine-tuned for perfection. Compacted into a seventeen-minute listening experience, this tight release is quite dense and diverse, ranging from cinematic-inspired strings to breakbeat-influenced DnB x Future Bass Tri-hybridization. It&#39;s a huge step forward for me, and I&#39;m proud to present this all to you.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this, and I hope you all are as excited as I am for this moment.
