    <title>Can anybody here sing?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/can-anybody-here-sing/21771</link>
    <description>If anyone here can sing lemme know because I really need a singer for a song. I don’t have any lyrics either. We could make it a collab. I don’t have any money tho lol.
 
Details; male or female, melodub/riddim(ish) type song. I don’t have a project link or song started yet but I’ll get one soon. I can do trap too</description>

            <p>Do you know if you’re looking for a male voice or female, or doesn’t matter/don’t care?</p>
<p>Do you have a reference track containing the kind of genre and singing style you have in mind?</p>
<p>Someone who sings heavy rock might not be a good fit if you’re aiming for a pop song, for example.<br>
Someone who sings quiet folk might not be a good fit if you want to have really powerful vocals in the track.</p>
<p>If you have an idea of what you’re aiming for, it’s worth being descriptive to help find the best match you can. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=12" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Are you able to share the WIP song/project, so people can judge for themselves if they’re a good fit and/or interested?</p>
