    <description>[KirkLurkPU, might put your name here - Game Over ( title might be changed )](https://app.auxy.co/projects/MLD4xq8oN3vxXAUE7Jn6pA==)

For the final song before I release my EP, I want to collaborate with anyone ( either newb or pro ), and you will see my idea for a video game retro vibe in this song. The chord progression is very easy, it&#39;s just C major, then G major.

We will only use C, Am, F, G as chord progression when we&#39;re at the bridge and chorus part.  It could be used for the rest of the song after intro. 

If you just want to use this project to your own liking, it&#39;s totally fine.
This proposal project only presents the intro for it, so you can get the gist of it.

Here is a simple rule : 
- If you&#39;re going to return the file make sure you add one value to the side.
For example : &quot;KirkLurkPU - Game Over ( Edit 1 )&quot;. When I give it back, it will be &quot;KirkLurkPU - Game Over ( Edit 2 )&quot;. That way, we can disambiguate if the file is the same or not.

After it&#39;s complete, it&#39;s just going to go through the process of mastering to add more FX and other stuff we might put that isn&#39;t in the system of Auxy.
I&#39;m excited for working with people! ü§ó

Here is the endoskeleton, now we just have to add flesh to it.<br>
The Sweet Saw on verse 1 is only an indicator for the ff. chords.<br>
Just remember to put ( Edit 2 ) after passing it to me. Also, you might not want to keep talking in here. Do you have discord?</p>
