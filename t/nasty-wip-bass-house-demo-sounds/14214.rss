    <description>Heyo, this is something I whipped up while getting lunch today. (PIXL &amp; Favright inspired)

Slight edit on link:
https://app.auxy.co/projects/9m38re75Gy9YxLEAbeeYqw==

Im also trying to do some kind of heavy trap breakdown in the last scene, so if someone has an idea or something to try that&#39;d be helpful.
