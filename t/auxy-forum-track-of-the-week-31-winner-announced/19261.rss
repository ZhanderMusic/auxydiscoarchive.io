    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-31-winner-announced/19261</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* Goxenar
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @Goxenar 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>Thanks so much man, it‚Äôs an honor. Thanks for stepping in and judging. Also, the reason it‚Äôs private is cuz I don‚Äôt have any art for it yet. Just looks kinda bad on my sc.

            <p>Stepping in for our pal Gox who cannot be located this time around <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> hope all is ok‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I‚Äôve listened to the entries, you guys did great. This week for me <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stardust">@Stardust</a> takes the cake - mixing is super clean, the bassline SLAPS (literally and figuratively) - the whole package is ultra cohesive. Not sure why you have this bad boy set to private!</p>
<p>Anyway, congratulations and if everyone would care to mosey on over to week 32 we‚Äôll catch up there <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>A lot of time, effort, and soul went into this one. I apologize for the lack of artwork, I wasn‚Äôt able to make any due to me temporarily being on mobile. Because of this, I went ahead and made it private. Once I get an opportunity to do some art and update the track I will make it public <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"> Here it is: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/isaac-legate/false-truth/s-ZoGhI8dap2v">https://soundcloud.com/isaac-legate/false-truth/s-ZoGhI8dap2v</a></p>
