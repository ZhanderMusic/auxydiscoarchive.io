    <description>Hello fellow bassheads

I have had Auxy for a few months now and I just completed my first complete track. I have been tweaking it for a little bit now and it is finally ready to be heard. I know i still have a lot to learn but i wouldn&#39;t post this online if i didnt know that i have something here. Any help and feedback that you can provide will be beyond helpful for me as i continue to learn and grow as an artist. But enough boring ish.... turn your bass up and get ready for The Disco Wobble ! You can find me on soundcloud through the link attached @Breezymode 

Like and repost and i will check out your pages too!

            <p>Hey guys I posted my first track on Saturday and the response was incredible! The Auxy community is seriously amazing. I feel like there is some potential for a remix here and definitely room for improvement.  <img src="/images/emoji/apple/face_with_monocle.png?v=5" title=":face_with_monocle:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_monocle:"></p>
<p>Let me know if you think you could remix this I would love to collab!</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/indir3ct">@INDIR3CT</a> thank you!! It is wild how different the first version of this song was and how it has evolved from there. Also I am loving the Auxy community so far it seems like everyone is really supportive and eager to share and make everyones content better! I like these ideas!</p>

            <p>Hey there and welcome to the Auxy Disco! Glad to see some new faces around here! Congratulations on posting your first official track. I totatlly love the effect and transition into the Trap Drop at 2:05! Keep it up! The only thing I would change is to have more snares/claps after the second drop at 2:40. But hey that’s just me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
<p>Congrats and keep it up!</p>
