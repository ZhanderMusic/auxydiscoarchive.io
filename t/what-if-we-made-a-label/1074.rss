<p>It covers everything from business registration and bank accounts to contracts and ISRC codes.</p>

            <p>I’ll make one if you want… I have a lot of experience with it, plus i really wanna do it… Usually a label fits a certain genre though so I think if I made one for Auxy producers I’d release future bass type stuff. Plus if a submission isn’t that good, I’d probably make some edits to it to make it better quality and release it as a “vectr edit” or something… idk if y’all would be interested in that but if so, DM me, but keep in mind, if I do it, I’ll only release the best demos, as quality beats quantity, if you wanted to speak in science terms.</p>

<div class="title">

 NYC:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Is anyone going to try to make this a full time thing?</p>
<p>I don’t really care for the profits and such. I just would love to be apart of a good group of (Auxy) producers that care for your production and not how many SC followers you have.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What do you mean by ‘full time thing’? Full time (Auxy) musician, right?<br>
If so, while SC followers alone are not important, ‘popularity’ is going to matter. You don’t have to be the most popular or even mainstream, but you’ll need enough to sell enough or get enough ad revenue to be able to make it ‘a full time thing’.<br>
(Unless you’re independently wealthy) <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Additionally, I’m skeptical about whether the music world outside of the Auxy community cares enough about the world of ‘Auxy producers’ for it to be a promotional booster.</p>
<p>However, there is a certain novelty/curiosity value to the fact that it’s <em>mobile-only</em>. (I’m sure <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/fredrik">@Fredrik</a> understand.)<br>
That could be an interesting angle. (Even as an Auxy user, I’ve got no real interest in ‘Auxy-made music’. However, music made on mobile is a bigger story that even people who don’t know or care about ‘Auxy producers’ might find interesting.)</p>
<p>If you position/promote it as ‘the next generation of music makers’ (and open it up to all mobile music makers – not just Auxy users), then you’ve potentially got a ‘story’ that some music outlets might pick up on.</p>
<p>You could have a site that promotes music made on mobile-only. The side-content would be about making music on mobile, promoting apps, tutorials, articles, interviews, etc…</p>
<p>(Sh*t, I think I’m talking myself into wanting to make a site like this happen. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As for getting some benefit out of being a <em>collective</em> (something more pro-active than the community created by this forum), the Team Supreme collective is worth checking out. It was a very pro-active thing, with lots of cross-promotion. There were weekly ‘beat cypher’ releases (similar in concept to BTC), which in turn helped promote members fuller releases, with some members being played/promoted on Mary-Anne Hobbs’ show on BBC Radio 1.</p>
<p>It also benefitted from members playing sets live, etc… – i.e. getting their music and faces out there.</p>
<p>(Check out the ‘Strength in Numbers’ video in the previous post – and then dig around online for their archived ‘cypher’ releases.)</p>

            <p>I don’t really understand the need to have an established collective, however. There are a lot of users here on the forum that are very willing to show support to anyone (whether you have 3 followers or more than 800). I just worry about potential exclusion (intentional or not) and it might just fizzle out in the end if the collective itself didn’t receive much attention.</p>

            <p>Collective: cool. Label: bad idea. Labels work like movie production studios. They fund projects with hopes of making money from it. They give you the money you need to create while expecting revenue in return. If someone wants to start a group thing with money as a possibility in the future I could only warn you of things becoming less fun down the line. Stay independent, have fun!</p>

            <p>Plus it would be a disaster if it REALLY picked up speed and gained some revenue and you would need to distribute the revenue to the artists and all sorts of pains that you need an actual label company to do if you want it done right.</p>

            <p>I’ve noticed people in the auxy community that have stolen tracks of mine. I’m afraid that there are all kinds of people who do stuff like that everywhere, even here in the Auxy community.</p>

            <p>“For the major part” implies at least a small presence of people who don’t fit in the group of “civil and nice people”. It’s just a plain not good idea to let the public access it it, especially with no moderation at all. Anyone who has ever moderated or run any music community or project will agree with me. Also, if it gets popular, it will be flooded with posts and everyone will unfollow it. Any label needs at least some time constraint between posting tracks.</p>

            <p>I don’t think so, this community is composed for the major part of civil and nice people, i’m sure that it will never happen…</p>

            <p>I agree, but its not technically a label, it’s an artist collective that accepts songs, not artists.</p>

            <p>People could post troll songs not made on Auxy. There <strong>has</strong> to be<br>
a moderation/acception platform of some sort.</p>
