            <p>maybe smoother transitions and layered sounds where it gets a bit empty. i think there is a lack of bass in the verse sections, i think you could add in a simple sub bass or something to compliment the chords in those areas. i like your use of samples, particularly the percussive melody that repeats throughout, i really like that one but i think a little bit more tweaking to instrument sounds to make them fit together better might be worthwhile, like some lowpass automation here and there to blend them together. i think the drums are pretty good, i think the snare in the last drop could use some reverb. good stuff <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
