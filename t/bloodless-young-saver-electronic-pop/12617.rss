    <title>Bloodless - Young Saver [Electronic Pop]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/bloodless-young-saver-electronic-pop/12617</link>
    <description>Long story short, I&#39;m a drummer by trade but haven&#39;t written songs in ages. Auxy has given me the freedom and versatility to write on the move and I&#39;ve actually managed to cobble 12 songs together this year. Album coming shortly, this is the first song I&#39;ve released. Thank you Auxy for making me create again!
