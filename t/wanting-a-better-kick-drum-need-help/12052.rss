    <title>Wanting a better kick drum!?Need help</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/wanting-a-better-kick-drum-need-help/12052</link>
    <description>So after constant testing and practice I have found a way to make some of the kicks from the electric kick drum collection sound abit better, but they still dont sound as good as I want them too (see attatched image for how I do this - its a simple change) 

I want a more distinct 808/909 techno kick, without importing samples (as I dont know how to do it) how can I improve my kicks to sound abit more professional? 

If anybody was able to tell me how to import sounds etc that would be great. ![image|281x499](upload://u8Fl3lMnfrgIJhvM31ttcOolvJE.jpeg)</description>

            <p>Sample importing does not allow you to use the imported sample as a ducker, even if it is a kick. At least, in my experience I haven’t been able to do such a feat.</p>
<p>I’d take a look at the actual 808 kicks in Leviathan 2.</p>
