    <description>**Please note: The Sweeper was unfortunately broken in 4.0 but it will be fixed if you update to 4.0.1.**

Automation refers to automating sound settings over time. A simple example is to automate the volume to fade in an instrument, but that&#39;s just scratching the surface of what you can do. Here&#39;s what you need to know to get started:

### Automation loops for each instrument
- The big news is that we have added automation loops—a new type of loop that lets you automate all the sound settings.
- The automation loops are added right below the melody loops for each instrument.
- The transition feature has been removed and all projects that use transitions have been updated to use automation loops instead.
- Just like melody loops, you select the automation loops that you want to be active in each scene. 
- Each scene can have one melody loop and one automation loop active for each instrument.

_Automation loops below the melody loops._

### Creating and editing automation loops
- Select which sound setting you want to automate in the top left corner.
- Tap the grid to add ‘nodes’ and build your automation curve.
- Drag nodes right to increase the value and left to decrease.
- Drag the curve to move a segment between two nodes.
- Select and edit multiple nodes by long-pressing the grid and use the selection box.
- Copy nodes by selecting them and then long-pressing the grid to paste.

_Volume automation with a couple of nodes._

### Automation length
- Note that each automated setting has its own length, which means you can make a loop that repeats e.g. a filter change every bar, while the volume is repeating every 4 bars.
- You can set automation length to ‘Scene’, which will make the curve as long as the current scene.

### Snapping to previous and next scenes
- If you remove the start- and end nodes (marked with a dot inside the circle), the curve will automatically snap to the values of the previous and next scenes.
- This is useful for making smooth transitions between scenes.

![snapline|200x200](/uploads/auxy/original/1X/67577743879b2635c88e73212b504ac87de1e7e5.jpg)
_Removing the start node snaps the curve to the value of the previous scene._

### Setting static values
- Sound settings are no longer stored with each scene.
- If you change e.g. the volume of an instrument in the tweak panel, it will change the volume across all scenes where volume is not automated.
- If you want specific values in a scene, you have to use an automation loop and set ‘static’ values, i.e. straight automation curves.
- The easiest way to set static values is to tap the grid once to add a straight line, and then drag the curve left or right.

### New sound tweaks
- Each sound now has a pan setting, which lets you pan the sound to the left or right.
- Each sound now has a highpass setting, which lets you filter out low frequencies to improve the mix or create sweeping effects.
- If a sound is missing a certain setting, it will be grayed out in the tweak panel and automation editor.

![newtweaks|200x250](/uploads/auxy/original/1X/a1eb69d81bf77b45a97549c111b41b94f3604448.jpg)
_The new tweak panel with pan and highpass._

### Pitch automation
- Selecting &#39;Pitch&#39; lets you pitch each instrument one octave up or down.
- Nodes will automatically snap to even semitones.

### Changes to how the Sweeper works
- The ‘Sweeper’ effect no longer has start and end values.
- To create a basic sweep, draw the notes and add automation to the lowpass setting.

<p>Is there an option to see the notes while doing the automation? Since sometimes I want to automate specific notes, but I continously have to go back to the notes to see at what specific place and what length they are. I hope this is understandable.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering it, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/auxy">@Auxy</a>. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=10" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>I agree that it’s clumsy re: chorus (though not an uncommon approach), but in the absence of formal controls… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Just trying to sell you on the multiple benefits arising from adding one tweak to an existing feature. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>My primary target would be automated fine tuning/detuning – mostly for sound character/width, but also as a boot-strappy way to mimic certain uses for LFO modulation.<br>
(I appreciate that adding real LFO modulation and vibrato, both additionally requiring depth and rate controls, would likely be overkill for Auxy and counter to the broader vision.(</p>

<p>You mean not snapping the pitch bend to even semitones? Maybe. Is that important?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Correct, the ability to position the bend points anywhere between semitones.</p>
<p>Important? Probably not. But that one feature would add multiple options for sound shaping/design.</p>
<p>With free detuning (i.e. no snapping on pitch bend feature), you could add width (and/or basic chorus effect) by layering multiple instances of an instrument, one/some tuned just above the note, the other(s) tuned just below.</p>
<p>Additionally/optionally, using automation, it would allow for experimenting with vibrato, including the wonky, drugged out, vibratos of the type that Boards of Canada became known for.</p>
<p>By adding a semitone grid to the pitch bend screen, with an option to disable snapping (Ref: Soft note toggle), users of all skill levels and tastes could get what they want out of the pitch bend feature.<br>
Having the ability pinch/zoom would be very helpful too, to allow for more detailed control.</p>

            <p>I think dist is converted to tone. There’s no reverb but we had to use the reverb slot for the former character macro, which is not a dist but a change in the oscillator balance. So it’s a little hack.</p>

            <p>Same here. I think it’s because the paste timeout is too short.</p>

            <p>When you click through the sound list, the previews you hear still follow the current instrument settings and/or automation. So if you have just created a new instrument track and choose a sound, it will sound different than if you switched to the same sound on a different instrument track where you had adjusted the settings, etc</p>

<p>Re: Pitch automation</p>
<p>Would it be possible to offer ‘snap to note’ on the Pitch automation screen as an option in a future update?<br>
Something that can be toggled off?</p>
<p>Or the ability to ‘zoom in’, which switches to more granular set of ‘snaps’.</p>
<p>(Trying out what can be done re: layered detuning, but the ‘snapping’ means it’s not really possible.)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a> Not sure if this is the right place to post bugs but I found one.</p>
<p>You know how when you click on the name of an instrument in the instruments list it plays the instrument’s sound? Those sounds are different than they used to be. That may be intentional but the main issue is when you create a new instrument and tap a note and you hear a preview. Then when you play it it sounds totally different.</p>
<p>Basically the “sound” on each instrument isn’t consistent between previewing notes and playing them. I’ll upload a video if I get a chance. Thanks for the awesome app!</p>
