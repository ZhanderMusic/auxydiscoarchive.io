    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/i-need-a-little-help-w-ableton/12875</link>
    <description>Okay so today’s my birthday.

And I just woke up and my family gave my my birthday presents-

A 2-TB windows 2-in-1 laptop and Ableton Live 10 Suite.

Whoah.

Do you guys have any tips or tricks for getting started with ableton, or maybe some tutorials you’d recommend? Any ways that I can connect it to Auxy efficiently? I want to get started as soon as possible.</description>

            <p>Very true.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that Ableton’s built-in wavetable synthesizer is very good. The only reason I recommended Serum is frankly for the presets it has along with the relative similarities it has to Auxy in terms of sound. As for the reverb, those plugins are top notch regardless.</p>

            <p>Yeah, external VSTs are nice, but I wouldn’t recommend them for beginners. Especially since suite comes with its own built in plugins, I’d recommend learning the Ableton workflow and learning sound design with those first. Once you have an idea of what you’re doing, then I’d recommend trying external plugins. Also - if given the option… ALWAYS TRY BEFORE YOU BUY. I can’t stress this enough. Know EXACTLY  what you’re buying, and try a demo when possible.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’d also recommend getting some plugins for it, although apparently Live’s selection of built-in stock plugins are far superior to FL Studio’s <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>Specifically, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.xferrecords.com/products/serum">Serum</a> and <a href="https://valhalladsp.com/">The valhalla family of reverb plugins, specifically Room and Plate</a>. Do keep in mind these are more of an investment for sure and since you were just given approximately 2000$ worth in birthday gifts, I’d say hold off on them until Christmas perhaps. Serum has a vast library of presets, some developed by 7 Skies even. That’s where the Destiny pack comes from. Not to mention that, according to Lenberg himself, Auxy’s in-house synthesizer was based off of the design of Serum. As for the valhalla reverb plugins, they are extra juicy ;3</p>

            <p>I’d recommend getting used to the features as well, however it is not a bad idea to use Auxy to sketch out basic ideas and then either export your stems or just the midi data into your new DAW. Especially when you’re so new and unfamiliar with a program, having something you are working towards really will help a ton.</p>

            <p>Yoooo!<br>
1: Happy birthday!<br>
2: congrats on getting Live Suite! (That’s a very expensive present. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=6" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:">)</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think using Auxy with Live is the best way to start. Live is JAM PACKED with features, which will take you awhile to learn all, so I’m not sure if using both will be very helpful for you while learning Live.</p>
