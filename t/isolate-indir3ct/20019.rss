    <title>Isolate - INDIR3CT</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/isolate-indir3ct/20019</link>
    <description>So my tablet wasn&#39;t backed up and did an automatic IOS update that was corrupted.. couldn&#39;t restore it and had to reset it. Long story short because I didn&#39;t know it was updating It wasn&#39;t backed up.. and I lost a good amount of pictures, videos, oh and all my Auxy projects as well. And Im broke and don&#39;t pay for iCloud. Anyways I&#39;m going through trying to salvage any shared Auxy files or older soundcloud private songs so I can at least get you something.

Heres a song I made a few months ago and never got around to posting... now its about all I got for you.. Sorry. Hope you like it.
