    <title>Uploading songs that don&#39;t belong to you</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/uploading-songs-that-dont-belong-to-you/850</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. I have recently noticed that many people have been downloading my float project from the feed, which is cool, but what&#39;s not cool is that people have been uploading the entire unchanged song for themselves. This isn&#39;t a project for you to post without changing anything or for changing one or two instruments and leaving everything else the same, because that&#39;s called piracy and it&#39;s illegal. This is why I&#39;m cutting down the project featured in the feed, so that it is more difficult to steal my track. Also, it would be great if you would remix ANYBODY&#39;s track with the title: (original creator of track) (track&#39;s original name) (Remix) or definitely don&#39;t leave out the artist&#39;s name or title of original track. Please message the artist of anything you want to remix if you have questions or would wish to remix their track.

That&#39;s all. Thank you!</description>

            <p>Man i had someone do that to my Megalovania remix a while back. Even tho after he published his i published mine and blew his outa the water, he still stole that from me. God me and a few others worked on that song and i was so proud of that. But he didnt even ask permission to do that. I had <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/sweetbeatz48">@sweetbeatz48</a> do a remix and he asked if he could. I gave him the ok and he even gave me credit IN THE TITLE. But this guy took that from me and published it for himself. That was a song i wanted to remix since i first got auxy and really needed help! And when i got help i also got it stolen. So this is just one story of many. DO NOT PUBLISH ANYTHING without permission from the original creator. So let this message sink in, i will see u all later, and keep ona rockin!</p>

            <p>This is a good point to bring up, but I‚Äôll play devils advocate here and say that perhaps we should take responsibility of protecting our works. A ‚Äúone for me, one for them‚Äù attitude might be healthy here.  I‚Äôve definitely got some projects that i will not be giving away.  Because it is quite fun to collaborate and get all this inspiration when everyone is cool about it but I suppose there will always be those who just want a free lunch so to speak.</p>
<p>On the other hand, would it be nice to have a little more structure/organization to project sharing to cut down on this? Absolutely, I‚Äôm just not sure what the solution would be.</p>

            <p>They should definitely add that in the next big update because it would reduce the amount of copies in the Auxy community</p>

            <p>I also saw one person download the Float project, change the name, and then say it was a ‚Äúcollab‚Äù. Which also isn‚Äôt cool. I usually try to change a good bit of stuff, but 2 or 3 times I haven‚Äôt changed enough in my remixes. So for now, I‚Äôve started sending private SC links to the original artists before posting remixes of their track.</p>
<p>Also, in the future Auxy could post remix rules for the songs telling how people should form their titles and such. Just an idea.</p>

            <p>It would be great if Auxy could provide licence options when sharing tracks.</p>
