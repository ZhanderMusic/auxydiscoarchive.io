            <p>Once you think of a name, you could make an alt with that name and slowly become more active on that account and stop using your old one. Then once everyone gets used to it you could do whatever you wanted with the old account.</p>

            <p>Well, pick something personal to you. For instance, AquaX was my first ever name anywhere, ever. So, I used to be called Aqua. (Hence my forum name). I’ve retained that element in my producer name. The ‘zi’ in my name is something very personal, so I don’t really wanna get into that. But, as I said, pick something of some value to you, so you don’t just abandon it within a month.</p>

            <p>Dude take it from me; <em>don’t</em> use your birth name in it’s entirety. You look less professional, and it’s almost definite that someone else in the world (and on the internet) has your same name which can be annoying if people are searching for your music</p>

            <p>Dude just use your original name. That’s the one thing that never looses meaning to you and is a permanent identity that will never change (it’s rock solid).</p>
