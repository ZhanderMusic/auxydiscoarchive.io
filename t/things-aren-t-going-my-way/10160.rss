    <title>Things aren’t going my way</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/things-aren-t-going-my-way/10160</link>
    <description>Hey. Recently, i released my new EP and im very proud of it. But, i hasn’t got nearly as many listens and likes etc. than my other tracks. A lot of people ignored it, and i was really sad, because i put a lot of work into it. I think many people have forgotten about me. I see other peoples track getting loads of feedback, and it makes me sad. Back in the day, when i released tracks they would get hundreds and hundreds of listens. And now, 24 listens on my most listened track in the EP. I know there is a lot of you guys that regularly get this many listens, but for me its nothing (no offense). Hope you guys understand. Please take a listen, it would mean a lot. Thank you for your time.
