    <title>Dystopia EP - By Vulture</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dystopia-ep-by-vulture/3696</link>
    <description>It’s about time I posted this.
These songs are really old, especially Revolt, so be warned, this isn’t my best work.
This is a more thrash ep, and includes a thrash house track, an Arabesque house track, and a future house track. Try to guess which is which!
