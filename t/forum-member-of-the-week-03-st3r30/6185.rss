            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/st3r30">@ST3R30</a> I went through your SC. Love your sweeping spacey sounds and continuous movement. Your stuff was good background music while I worked.</p>
<p><strong>Rise</strong> drew my attention first, with the Star Trek like intro, then moving onto lowpass wobbles.</p>
<p><strong>Melancholic</strong> had a more emotive sound to me, but still kinda dancey. I enjoyed the pauses you took to experiment with chippy computer sounds. I really enjoyed the lead. I started to whistle to it. A lot of your stuff from a month or two ago has nice strong leads. Keep doing whatever you were doing!</p>

            <p>You have music in your soul. Keep it going. I enjoyed what I heard. Sometimes I think reviewers are too critical. Music comes in all shapes and sizes. I’m sort of an outcast. I’m 67 years old and prefer jazz rock fusion. Most of the music on Auxy is  too “techno” for my liking, but I enjoy what I produce, and I can tell you enjoy what you do as well.</p>

            <p>I’ve listened to a few of your (<a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/st3r30">@ST3R30</a>) songs and I enjoyed them for the most part. So…</p>
<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The chords in your songs are really unique (most of the time *<em>cough</em> * *<em>cough</em> * <em>solstice</em> *<em>cough</em> * *<em>cough</em> *) and really make the song better.</li>
<li>In my opinion, you’re transitions between buildups and drops really flow!</li>
<li>Speaking of drops, those are pretty good too!</li>
<li>Also your logos are awesome!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your songs do get a bit repetitive.</li>
<li>In my opinion, you could definitely work on your percussion.</li>
<li>There’s some places where you differentiate one part from another by adding another sound, but in those places it feels like you didn’t add enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>So overall, your songs are really aren’t really my style, but I would definitely listen to some of them again.</p>

            <p>Enjoyed checking out your tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strong intros repeatedly drew me in. eg: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thatguywhousesauxy/melancholic">melancholic</a> (one of my fav tracks of yours).</li>
<li>Layering sounds well, so they don’t feel stock standard.</li>
<li>Automation effects used competently</li>
<li>Phat basslines</li>
<li>Drops are pretty good.</li>
<li>Interesting tracks that don’t all sound the same; some high energy, others chilled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What you do sounds good, but I agree with some others that it sometimes gets repetitive.  Good, but repetitive.  eg: I notice people are commenting on the first half of your tracks more. Suggest you <strong>add more variations at the end of your composition process &amp; avoid long stretches with the same sequence in any of your layers.</strong>  If you fix that one thing, it would make a huge difference. eg: You did it well with Melancholic, which totally held my interest from start to end and which I’d listen to again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for sharing your stuff with us!</p>

            <p>Listened to a few of your songs, they’re pretty dank! I’m loving Solstice and Gamechanger. Could just be me, but I think you should add a little more bass to some of your songs. And in Promises, it would sound even awesomer if the lowpass was turned down a bit, IMO it was a bit punchy.</p>
<p>Really like your tracks, they have lots of potential! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I went through all your songs. Solstice is probably my favorite too. The one I have to say is it that all of your songs are verry repetitive imo. It feels like one instrument will playing the same loop the whole song and you repeat the same scene 2 or 3 times in a row. Try and keep adding variety as you work through your songs and I think you will be in very good shape!<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

            <p>Alright, I took a listen to a few. The chord progressions are sooooo good <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">. Your tracks seemed…organised, because there wasn’t a lot going on, but not too little either. It helps with build-ups, because all you need to do is add on to what you have. Keep it up! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Very, all over the place. Weird to listen to while making soundcloud banners, but it’s good to fall asleep to, (if you’re me) overall, very nice.</p>

            <p>Hey there! Listening to Solstice right now…Pretty solid stuff dude! Maybe layering a little more could help, and perhaps not quite so repetitive, but other than that nice song! Keep it up <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
