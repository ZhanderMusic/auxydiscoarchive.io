            <p>Same. Right now actually. I keep trying to make a certain sounding song, and then I find that I simply can’t make that sound in Auxy. I don’t really have any other daw options right now so it’s really discouraging…</p>

            <p>Another perspective to consider…</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not one of the things that will become a vocation to you.<br>
Maybe you’re not ‘a musician’, or a ‘music artist’, but someone with a big interest in, and some talent for, making music.</p>
<p>And that’s ok.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what I mean…</p>
<p>I make music. I paint. I do screenprinting. None of these are my day job.<br>
I’m (currently*) quite passionate about all of them and (currently*) enjoy all of them a great deal, but they’re not the thing I’m (currently*) most passionate about or enjoy the most. That’s where my (current*) day job comes in.</p>
<p>I only do any of them when inspiration and interest pushes me to. I don’t force it, at all. I (currently*) have a reasonably high level of interest for them and enjoy exploring them as a creative outlet. I may have even shown/developed some talent for them, but that doesn’t mean I need to create expectations for myself. I do them <em>while I enjoy them</em>.</p>
<p>If I become more passionate about them, <span class="bbcode-u"><em>then</em> I’ll set up some goals and expectations</span>.</p>
<p>I’m not a musician with a label and an audience expecting a new song, so I can make music when <em>I</em> want to. The moment it stops being enjoyable, I’ll take a break until my interest in it returns.<br>
(If I’m pushing myself to do something I’m not interested in, I’m probably not doing it as well as I could/should and I’m probably not enjoying it. Even worse, you can even develop a resentment for it, spoiling/tainting how you feel about it.)</p>
<p>Unless you’ve made a commitment to music as a vocation and career, I see no reason to push yourself beyond what you find enjoyable - or feel bad about the level or quality of recent output.</p>
<p>If you find yourself wanting to get back into it after a little while, cool. But, if a break turns into weeks, months or even years (or, in my case, decades), then presumably it wasn’t such a major thing - <span class="bbcode-u">and that’s ok</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* ‘currently’ is important. People change. Their passions and interests change. Things that they’re passionate about now may become less important to them later. Things that aren’t important to them now might become the thing that steers the rest of their lives. And things that were important to them in the past, but aren’t now, may become important to them again.</p>

            <p>Haha thats the like the 2nd stage of being a music artist.</p>
<p>Stage 1: beginning learning music and how it works and flows. Learning chords and other things as you go along. Music making is basically just starting.</p>
<p>Stage 2: You get the music and everything. Yet only sometimes you have a breakthrough, sometimes your in a hole on what to do.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Excelling in music making and not learning but knowing exactly what to do.</p>

            <p>Not kidding, every musician goes through this at some point, myself included. A way to remedy this, honestly, is to take a break. Maybe you’re just out of ideas, and your mind needs some time to rest. Anyway, just give it some time, and don’t worry, the ideas will start to flow again. Be patient.</p>

            <p>I feel you man. Listen to music, go outside, that might cope with being uninspired. Also, just mess around on Auxy everday and good ideas will eventually come your way. Some days I’m more talented and inspired than others.</p>
