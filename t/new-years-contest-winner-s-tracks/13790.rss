    <title>New Years Contest Winner’s Tracks</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/new-years-contest-winner-s-tracks/13790</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! 
On the first day of the year, I held a contest, and I intended on having multiple winners. Only a few participated though, so I figured I would thank everyone who did participate by posting their songs. 

Winners: 
@GR3Y
@El1011
@FRUDS
@Ch33t4h
@anon34001995     

Here is the link:
