    <title>Cheddr - Pittsburgh (Matik Remix)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/cheddr-pittsburgh-matik-remix/9080</link>
    <description>Hi! This is a track that I remixed for @Cheddr&#39;s song Pittsburgh.

You can check out the original here: 
https://soundcloud.com/cheddr/pittsburgh

This track was released a couple weeks back, but I was requested just recently that I should post it on the forum!
I guess you say this track is future? It has some elements of it in there, but I&#39;m still not entirely sure. There&#39;s also a completely different genre that changes during the end! About three-quarters of the time, I was being lazy and not working on it, so it kind of took me a while to get out to the public.

Anyways, for those who haven&#39;t listened, here it is:
