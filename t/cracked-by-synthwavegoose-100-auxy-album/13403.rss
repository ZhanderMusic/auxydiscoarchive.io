    <title>“Cracked” by SynthwaveGoose // 100% Auxy Album</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/cracked-by-synthwavegoose-100-auxy-album/13403</link>
    <description>After more than two years since the birth of &quot;Synthwave Goose&quot; I finally released my first full album completely composed in Auxy.

In theory composing music in Auxy is pretty simple and it allows you to concentrate fully on the content of the melodies as well as the atmosphere. However, it is still hard enough as you need to work in a certain direction while sustaining diversity. Despite the various challenges faced, I had a lot of pleasure in the process. 

As a huge movie fan, I put my main emphasis on atmosphere and cinematic in some tracks. Also I couldn&#39;t do it without various allusions. &quot;Thrill Me&quot; is partially inspired by the original Rambo’s soundtrack, and in the &quot;Mirage&quot; there are references to the main theme of Terminator. There are some vibes of John Carpenter&#39;s music and even influence of modern electronic musicians.

The biggest challenge was in choosing the right tracks and putting them together to get a complete picture. I had a lot of different ideas, but when I found out that this year is the anniversary of William Gibson, I realized that this could be a great inspiration. And now I hope, I will as well inspire you by my music.

Full album you can listen for free on [bandcamp](https://synthwavegoose.bandcamp.com/album/cracked). I hope, you will really enjoy! Happy holidays!</description>
