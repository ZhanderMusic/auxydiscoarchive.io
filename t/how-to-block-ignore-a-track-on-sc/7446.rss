    <title>How to block / ignore a track on SC?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-block-ignore-a-track-on-sc/7446</link>
    <description>Is there any way to block or ignore a track on SC?

I keep getting certain tracks popping up in the &#39;Next up&#39; that I don&#39;t want to hear.
(I&#39;ve not liked them and I don&#39;t follow those who made them. I always skip/stop it, but SC&#39;s not smart enough to take the hint.)

I&#39;m wondering if blocking the artist will work, but it seems like a sledgehammer/walnut thing to do.</description>

            <p>Fwiw, <a href="https://soundcloudcommunity.com/desktop-230066/how-can-i-prevent-specific-tracks-by-other-people-appearing-in-my-next-up-auto-play-station-playlist-7401266">just posted the question on the SC community board</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll feedback here if anyone mentions a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(Aaargh. It’s up next after <em>every</em> track I choose to play. It’s killing SC for me [as a listener])</p>

            <p>This often happens to me as well. I often get “recommended artists” off newgrounds/geometry dash because I liked 1 track a year ago… Looking for a solution to this as well.</p>
