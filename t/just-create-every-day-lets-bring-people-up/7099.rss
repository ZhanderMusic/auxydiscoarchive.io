&quot;Sometimes you just need to create, sometimes you just need to mess up, sometimes you just need to focus on that quantity, to get the reps in so the quality comes later. I&#39;m sick of seeing people quit because of negativity, I&#39;m sick of seeing people quit because of people putting them down, because they don&#39;t have  support...lets just be there for people... lets create to create. Let help one another, let&#39;s bring people up.&quot; - Quentin Allums</description>

            <p>Yep. Nothing wrong with trying lots of stuff in the creative world. Especially on the Internet where crap will soon be forgotten but good will be remembered.</p>

            <p>Nice. I feel the same way. I like to create a new song every day and a lot of people say I shouldn’t but because I create a new song every day I have all these new ideas flowing and although not all of them are good, some of them are great and I’m always getting better and learning something new every day.</p>
