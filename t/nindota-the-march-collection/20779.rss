    <title>Nindota - The March Collection</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/nindota-the-march-collection/20779</link>
    <description>My mass upload is finally here, and all the music tracks can be found in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhN4j0GKlCc6TqArJE6oUtWB5HnAaVg7G).
Additionally, a condensed version containing only 10 of the 62 music tracks can be found in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhN4j0GKlCc6ODJod04stHYnZklCeIEFU).

The total length of the collection is about 2 hours and 20 minutes, so I felt the condensed version a necessity seeing as not everyone has the time to listen to music for that long, nor might they remain interested long enough to see the whole thing through.
I just hope people may enjoy the music I&#39;ve made, and/or are willing to give each track a shot</description>

            <p>I’ve now uploaded it to Bandcamp as well, where you can buy it for the low price of $2Cad or more (pay what you want), or just listen to it as much as you want for free<br>
