    <title>Is the Subscription worth it?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/is-the-subscription-worth-it/11993</link>
    <description>Hey guys I didn’t know what to put this in over than random so yeah lol. I want to know if the subscription is worth it, I don’t particularly like that there aren’t many demo sounds, but I understand why I mean you need money to keep things going right? But I want to know if I’m spending my money wisely by subscribing. So please share your thoughts! ^^</description>

            <p>to Put it simply, if you already enjoy using Auxy, getting the subscription will certainly make you enjoy it more as you’ll of course have access to the many many sounds available and all future, monthly sounds.</p>

            <p>My thoughts are, if you like the app so far and its potential, go for it. If you enjoy it and even if you’d spend a few hours per month just playing around and making a track or two for fun, I would say it’s worth it. If you wanted to get more serious about music production, it’s going to be a simple, but effective foot in the door for you.</p>

            <p>I’m sure others would say the same, I assure you with the sub and the ability to import your own samples it will take substantially longer to hit a wall. I’ve been producing for nearly 19 years now and Auxy is like 80% of what I need. Everyone’s got different needs of course, but having been around the block I can promise there’s a lot under the hood.</p>

            <p>Well, I’m still an amateur so until I get more experienced, which will take time, I feel satisfied with Auxy, but I want to make music that’s not repetitive because the demos are limited I feel like it takes more work than it should to make my songs sound different from eachother because the instruments are the same I feel like I’m not really moving forward yet.</p>

<p>Now whether or not Auxy provides everything you need for a fiver, that’s a different story and everyone will have a different answer. But yeah, just looking at what you get for the money per month, I would say yes and it’s a good value.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed on this.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/katki">@Katki</a>, it’s more dependent on what sort of needs and sounds you are looking for. I also agree that the demo selection is lacking in anything that would grab everyone’s attention. At least with something like the OG pack, there was at least a few sounds that anyone could be happy with. Now… it’s much more limited in making an impression that says “I’m worth buying”.</p>

            <p>I’d suggest getting it for a month or two, to see if it works for you.<br>
If the answer is yes, opt for an annual subscription and save yourself a few pennies.</p>

            <p>I think as far as subscriptions go, yes. There is so much content in here and it’s constantly updated. For sample import alone I think it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Now whether or not Auxy provides everything you need for a fiver, that’s a different story and everyone will have a different answer. But yeah, just looking at what you get for the money per month, I would say yes and it’s a good value.</p>

            <p>Hey guys I didn’t know what to put this in over than random so yeah lol. I want to know if the subscription is worth it, I don’t particularly like that there aren’t many demo sounds, but I understand why I mean you need money to keep things going right? But I want to know if I’m spending my money wisely by subscribing. So please share your thoughts! ^^</p>
