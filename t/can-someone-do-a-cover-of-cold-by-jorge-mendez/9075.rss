    <title>Can someone do a cover of Cold by Jorge Mendez?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/can-someone-do-a-cover-of-cold-by-jorge-mendez/9075</link>
    <description>Okay, so, now that we have the pianos and orchestral sound packs, I was wondering if someone could recreate this song on Auxy? It&#39;s called, &quot;Cold by Jorge Mendez&quot;.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUZeSYsU0Uk

To whomever can replicate it, I would be so grateful!!!
Plus, it would be a real challenge to replicate it!!
You can make the song, release it, and then post the SoundCloud link here, or you can make the song, and then post the project file here! 
Either way, would be super grateful to whoever could/can replicate it!!</description>

Hey, I don’t want to sound rude, or anything of the sort, but were you able to replicate the song?<br>
Or is it proving to be a bit tougher than you thought?</p>
