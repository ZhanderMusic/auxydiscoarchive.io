    <description>Hey,

Seems like the majority of users who want to be part of a community prefers the Auxy Collective on Discord, which we think is awesome! So is it time to close down this forum, or why would we need to keep it in the future? Always looking to keep things focused and avoid dragging things along if they are no longer relevant.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think the Auxy Collective Discord is certainly lively and engaging, with feedback streams and other initiatives still ongoing, like the Auxy Collective Community Awards.</p>
<p>I often find it almost impossible to be able to follow any music discussion in the general chat, though, as it is often interspersed amongst broader general conversation in relation to life, etc. (Maybe if there was a channel called <code>#music-production</code> or such, it might help.) The <code>#resources</code> channel doesn’t really cover it, as that is more for links to external resources. And people do post WIPs in the main chat and have conversations about music production there.</p>
<p>Discord, in general, can also be hard to follow for me, since it’s intended for instantaneous chat, and I’m in a, generally, more isolated timezone, so I have found discussions on the Disco easier to follow in that regard.</p>
<p>I would probably also like to opt to continue to have the Disco and have it be tended to with more curation, but it seems harder at this stage. I’ve been here checking in occasionally since 2017 just after the Disco started, and it felt like there was a lot of excitement about Auxy, its future, and with other members in its community. Community members had interesting insights to share, Auxy’s developers were keen to interact with the community, and there was a lot of hype around challenges and tournaments.</p>
<p>Since then, with various heated discussions around some decisions around the subscription; prolonged absences from developers that were not addressed immediately and thus fed into speculation of disappointment about the app’s future and unfortunately unflattering impressions of the developers’ expectations around community interaction; and a vast number of community members no longer engaging here, I think this environment makes it harder to build up that previous level of engagement again right now, than to do it from the beginning, if one wanted to go about doing that.</p>
<p>As it is, the forum is quite sparse these days, and the past stuff seems to hang over it like a cloud, not motivating people to post here. (I noticed people still occasionally share their opinions on Auxy, and continue to give each other feedback, on Discord.) Forums and chat do give different things, but they need to each be continuously maintained and curated to fully provide each of their unique offerings. I can kind of understand, though, if Auxy does not have the people resources to curate such a community again — I thought the team would grow if the success of the subscription was enough for it, but the team has not grown, as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>But I think it’s too much to rely on just community members as janitors and tournament organisers to do their work again and again for free, and so the activity has dwindled accordingly. It’s no longer anywhere near as rewarding to do, even if others want to take on running Track of the Week, Beat the Clock or tournaments, because there aren’t much people here, and the lack of activity is feeding back into itself there (as those initiatives would breathe life back into the community and drive more engagement). So if the community is left open, I can’t see it flourishing with the current state of continued lack of care and attention. If you do decide to shut down the community though, I hope you would make sure to provide people time to save content, or perhaps a backup be stored at least.</p>

            <p>I think in its current form, there’s little case for keeping the forum open at all.<br>
If Auxy’s heart isn’t in maintaining and really engaging with an Auxy community, then wind it down and pull the plug.</p>
<p>It kinda seems that you’re looking for an OK from (enough of) the community here to pull the plug without any backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
However, as mentioned, I think there’s a great case for engaging <em>more</em> with the Auxy user community, in an official Auxy space, and across official Auxy channels. I see them/us as a hugely under-utilised marketing and content resource.</p>
<p>Is that an option you’re open to?</p>

            <p>In my eyes, a huge con of the forum is that you are active here. This is a direct way to give input for the app. Discord isn’t. It would be if you were to join the AC and be active there, but that’s mostly down to your personal preference. I think that if people want to approach you, you are the one to decide whether you’d prefer that via this forum or Discord. I think it’s best for everyone if the dev(s) is/are in an environment they are the most comfortable in. It’s your app, after all.</p>

<p>If the forum dies, if there is a different email digest you can send out to maintain that data flow, it would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Just a quick thought, its better here to get feedback on audio files or unfinished projects here without sharing the actual link, because on discord you cant upload very big files without purchasing a higher edition which alot of people dont have money for. But i mean hey, there is always private sc links too ig. Just some food for thought.</p>

            <p>Hi, sorry to hijack this thread but I’ve just tried to add AC to my ever expanding list of Discord servers. I found the page at <a href="https://auxycollective.me" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://auxycollective.me</a> and the Invite button. I then get a message assuring me that “Brandy” has invited me to the server. I then click to accept the invite, say that I want to open the separate Discord app, see the stuff about the details being “beamed in” to the app - except they’re not. When I get inside of Discord, there’s no sign of the Auxy Collective server. Any one know what I’m doing wrong?</p>
<p>UPDATE: Yet another example of websites not testing their web code on Mac Safari <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>

            <p>I’m hoping the cost isn’t the issue.<br>
Even if on the Discourse Business package, the costs aren’t hugely high, even from a small business POV.</p>
<p>Imo, the forum, the community, and the musical output, are a source of so much potential growth material that’s currently going untapped — that could produce business outcomes far greater than the financial cost of the forum software — if properly engaged with.</p>
<p>I’m happy to throw around some ideas with you, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/auxy">@Auxy</a>, if you’re interested. Low-hanging fruit through to more substantial effort/rewards opportunities and experiments.</p>

            <p>To clarify, while (imo) it’s a little strange that a company in Auxy’s position seems to be seeking excuses to do things that create more distance between itself and its user community… it’s less about who owns the platform and more about what kind of presence and engagement level Auxy wants to have — and what level the community would like Auxy to have — in that community.</p>
<div class="spoiler"><a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/should-we-keep-the-forum-alive/21149/16">spoiler</a></div>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
So, some questions for you, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/auxy">@Auxy</a>.</p>
<p>What role do you see for Auxy re: the Auxy community, in terms of growth, marketing, etc…?</p>
<p>What kind of involvement from official Auxy would be ideal, if any?</p>
<p>What kind of community would you most like to have around Auxy, from a business POV?</p>
<p>What opportunities, if any, do you think Auxy might gain by being actively engaged with the community/user base?</p>

            <p>AC Discord Janitor here – while I do think that the Discord has had a very clear spike in popularity since the announcement and people are obviously excited about the idea of it, I think the Discord and the forum both offer different things for different people. In short – there’s a market for both, and if there’s enough of a user-base on the forum and the upkeep costs aren’t an issue then it would probably be beneficial to keep it up.</p>
<p>There is a clear difference in dynamic and environment that the Discord can’t offer in some aspects that are important for forum-lovers, who might not be all that excited about completely migrating to Discord.</p>
