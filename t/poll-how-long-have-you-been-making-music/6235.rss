            <p>I’ve been <em>trying</em> to make music since the 80’s (yes I’m that old…)<br>
Back when all I had was a Casio keyboard and a dual deck cassette recorder… fun.<br>
Auxy is the first thing I’ve had any luck with. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>The point is, it’s not how long you’ve been making music. It’s the quality and time you spend making each song and putting your emotions into whatever your making.</p>

<p>I felt shocked when I realised I’ve been making music on and off for about 25 years. Most people on this forum haven’t existed for 25 years…!</p>

            <p>Technically, the first time i made music was in like middle school (about 6-7 years ago), but that was mainly just throwing loops together in Garageband with no real purpose.  Dropped it after a while.  But it wasnt until sophomore year of High S. that i really started doing music as a hobby n stuff.<br>
I saw the new garageband update.  it was a huge one, and really one that made garageband a real DAW that was pretty powerful.</p>
<p>Anyway, in terms of Auxy, i actually recently had my one year “anniversary” (i guess) of using the app.  I got it on Christmas day of 2016 &amp; been using it since (obviously)</p>
