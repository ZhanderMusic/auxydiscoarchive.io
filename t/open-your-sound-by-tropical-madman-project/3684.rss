            <p>The tweaks really helped. It sound a lot better. I’ll probably still use the ducker for the bass drop. I’ll think about it. Thanks! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>Cool - I feel like the ducker was causing wayyyy too much movement especially since you were already riding the lowpass on gossip. I made some edits, you don’t have to use obviously just some lil tweaks <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
