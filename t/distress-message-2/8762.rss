Hello everyone, My name is Xiejra and today is my birthday. 
I have been producing music for around 6 months so far, and so much has happened in that time. 

Firstly I would like to say thank you to a few of my friends on the Disco server: 

@Xicon had fun collaborating with you! would love to do more in the future. 

@anon35891271 thanks for the support during the last few months of me being here 

@HELIXX  Probably inspired me to do loads of new stuff whether you realised it or not! 

@xavior thanks for being a massive influence and being so supportive of my work. 

@MR_ANDERSON thanks for believing in me and helping me out! 

These are just a few if the people who have really welcomed me into this community and to that I say thank you all! 

Anyway... So Today I am officially announcing my first and last Auxy made album: “Limitations And A Bad Case Of Perfectionism” 
not a particularly catchy name but it is all that is my feelings towards music at this stage that I can express through words. 

My Tracks I can assure you will be like nothing you have heard before. Here is a preview of what is to come, I hope you all like it. 

stay tuned... 

EDIT: I may not leave the community I may just become very inactive

~X

            <p>Oh yes of cause! Auxy is perfect for when you suddenly have an idea.</p>
<p>Whether it be on the go or in the middle of the night, instead of openeing up ableton which would take time, I would do it by writing it in Auxy.</p>
<p>I will probably continue to ise Auxy but not to write full songs.</p>

            <p>Ahaa. Cool.</p>
<p>I have Ableton too, but I still think Auxy’s ideal for those moments when inspiration strikes and you just want to get something down and explore it a bit.</p>
<p>I don’t use Ableton as much as a should do, given that I coughed out for Suite, but I do intend to get back into it.</p>
<p>Still, I think Auxy will stay a significant part of my creative process.</p>
