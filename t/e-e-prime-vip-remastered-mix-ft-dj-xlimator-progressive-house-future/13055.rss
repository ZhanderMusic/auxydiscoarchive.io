Remastered mix of Prime, a collab I did with @anon2811266 back in the days as James Lucien. Glad to finally get a look back at this song, as it always bothered me the ways I messed up so much of it xD

Hope you all enjoy and take a look at it at the very least.

            <p>Ah, cool.<br>
If you believe that it counts as a remaster, then by all means, we’ll all consider it a remaster.</p>
<p>I didn’t post my article out of critical intent. I’m just trying to make the Auxy community a bit more informed.<br>

            <p>The “whoops” are Coin.</p>
<p>And I would argue that it is indeed a remaster, because there was actual mixing done to bring it up to a mastered product, including all of the items you brought up. The original mix, straight from Auxy in it’s original form, wasn’t quite up to standard either. So, therefore, the tag applies.</p>
<p>As an addendum, Amuse is pretty weird when it comes to actually applying a “tag” of sorts to your song. I’ve had issue getting a “VIP” tag to go through, but “Remastered” works, so I’ve simply been using that.</p>
<p>If you want to be super critical about it, I suppose the right word to use would be “Reimagining”, but that doesn’t quite catch a layman’s attention quite like “Remastered”, and so I decided to go with that as the basis of the naming.</p>
<p>Glad you liked the track at least, and I do hope that you see how I would legitimately be able to consider this a “remastered” mix.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Hey, all, 
It’s your friendly neighborhood audio engineer, Nick Elle. 
I have been seeing a lot of people putting the tag “remaster” on their tracks, but without actually knowing what a master actually is. 
Well, I’m here to explain a bit. 
In modern audio engineering, you have three parts: Recording, Mixing, and Mastering. But, for production, you really only have two parts: Mixing and Mastering, so I’ll skip recording. 
Mixing is basically what it sounds like. 
It’s mixing a lot of sounds toge…
