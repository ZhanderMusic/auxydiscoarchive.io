    <title>Question relating to one of my WIP tracks and copyright infringement</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/question-relating-to-one-of-my-wip-tracks-and-copyright-infringement/11770</link>
    <description>Before I got at all serious about music production, I started to make one of the songs that ended up becoming part of my upcoming album around 4 years ago. I didn&#39;t know really anything about music production, and I was using Apple loops in GarageBand because they were the only good thing I could find for free at the time. When I found Auxy, I decided I wanted to remake the song, revamp the lyrics, and make it more original. The only parts that I want to sound similar to the loops I put together in GarageBand are the two verses.

Sense I plan on making those parts sound so similar to the loops, I&#39;m worried about facing copyright strikes or legal penalties for copyright infringement when I commercially distribute that song.

I am aware that Apple loops are royalty free, and can be used in a track that is sold commercially as long as single loops aren&#39;t sold by themselves, but tracks using Apple loops cannot be monetized on YouTube, which I plan on using.

At the same time, I am also aware that while chords and instruments aren&#39;t copyright-able, melodies are.

Because of this, I am not sure if I can safely use melodies from Apple loops that I near replicated in the verses of my WIP track in Auxy. Every other part of the song will be different and original, but I really like how the verses sounded in GarageBand. I will change the melodies if nobody knows with 100% confidence that I won&#39;t run into issues with copyright and that I will be able to post that track on YouTube.</description>

            <p>you dont need to credit any of the GB samples.  Those are all free to use.  I use some of them for references or by chopping them up and sampling/editing individual parts of them.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t worry about the loops. All of the loops and such on Garageband are free from copyright. You only run the risk of an experienced user recognising that they’re from Garageband. That’s why in some old iMovie films you might see around, they all have similar sounding SFX and scores.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all of your responses! I’ve decided to use the loops as more of a reference/inspiration rather than copying the melodies. It probably wouldn’t have been an issue, but sense I plan on distributing my music to multiple services through Amuse, I’d rather play it safe than sorry.</p>

            <p>That’s probably unnecessary. You don’t usually see artists crediting samples they used.</p>

            <p>I don’t know too much about how copyright law would apply to this, but personally I feel like you would be ok, simply because everything else is original and you didn’t just take the loop straight from GarageBand and put it in your song. If you want to be careful, I would just recommend maybe changing around a few of the notes in the melody or something small like that, just to make it more original. Not sure if that’s completely true or possible, but it’s just my thoughts on it.</p>

            <p>I heard something against using ‘non-liscenced’ Apple Loops, but I’m not sure if that’s actually true.</p>
<p>Note that if you were to publish a song with actual apple loops, and you used one of the preset boards (R&amp;B, Rock), it would be taken down if someone else already published it.</p>

            <p>You should be fine.  ngl, I’ve ripped off some of the GB loop melodies and haven’t had any problems, tho I don’t monetize my stuff.</p>
<p>Try it out. Post the melody on YT in the instruments you’re using and see if it gets flagged.</p>
<p>But honestly, as far as I know, apple isn’t hella stingy about their GB stuff unlike FL or something.</p>
