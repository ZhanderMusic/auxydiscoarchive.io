    <description>The new update for Auxy is super cool, and really fun to play around with.
I&#39;ve already found some cool uses for it, but I wanna see what you guys can come up with!</description>

            <p>Wow, just wow. I’m too lazy to put how good this song is into words, but holy CRAP, that was amazing. Tons of great melodies and great effects! (Using the sweeper to sound like a wave was a cool idea!)</p>

            <p>I honestly think that one of my main uses for the automation is hat automation, to give it a top layer.<br>
I honestly think that it’s going to help with House for some people.</p>

            <p>With the new update out, I’ve been lately messing with some of the lead automations in my previous songs (I don’t have many, I got Auxy 2 days before the update came out :p). I’ve always wanted some sort of vibrato in Auxy, so I’ve been experimenting with the pitch automation and rate. It is quite strenuous drawing in each of those triangles but it makes a cool sound when you’re finished (I just wish you could go between quarter-tones, instead of semitones to sound less “robotic”). I’ve also been using the pitch automation for buildups and I’m very satisfied with the results. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

            <p>First of all, thanks for the comment. What do you mean by “screechy”? Did you mean something was too loud or high-pitched? Or did you mean that there was too much going on in the background?</p>

            <p>I’ve heard a bit of this song before, but was a bit thrown off bye the screechy background loop. But after listening to this song in it’s entirety, I was glad I did. Great stuff, keep up the good work!</p>
