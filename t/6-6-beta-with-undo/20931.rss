    <title>6.6 Beta with Undo</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/6-6-beta-with-undo/20931</link>
    <description>Just sent out a new beta to everyone who helped testing the previous version. The big news is that now you can (finally) undo any changes in the loop editor! 🥳

Also in this version:
- Old renders are automatically grouped and can be quickly deleted if you need to free up space on your device
- New scenes are made empty by default (use duplicate if you want to copy an existing scene)
- The last scene now stays selected when you play the track to the end
- A few tweaks for improved graphics (can you spot the differences?)

If you want to test it and didn&#39;t get an invite:

            <p>Just posted build 864, which we’re going to release publicly unless something new comes up.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ducker is now enabled when master effects are switched off</li>
<li>Automatically increase gain when master effects are switched off</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause drums not to make any sound for a few seconds when launching the app</li>
<li>Polished how individual samples are exported when that option is selected</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know if you find anything suspicious!</p>

            <p>Toggle Master Effects On/Off is great addon, but disabling Master effects also disable Ducker which it should not cuz my almost every project uses it and it’s not great idea to disable everything at once.<br>
Why don’t we get  option to choose which master effect we want to disable.<br>
Like  Toggle<br>
Ducker   On/Off<br>
Gain.      On/Off<br>
Compressor        On/Off<br>
Limiter.                On/Off</p>

            <p>New beta build (863) just posted with the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added option to disable master effects. Note that the limiter is still on but it will not engage unless you push the gain up a lot. In normal circumstances, we estimate that you will have ca 12 dB headroom before hitting the limiter.</li>
<li>Added option to render samples as individual stems. Just tap the “Export Stems” button and you will be asked whether you want to render the samples individually. This will need some additional polish and we can probably improve performance a bit.</li>
<li>Fixed scene preview graphic glitch so that the last loop doesn’t look cut-off.</li>
<li>Tapping the master gain slider now moves the handle correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know what you think about these changes and whether you find any issues! The plan is to release this version publicly next week.</p>

            <p>What I’m guessing is that the prerecorded demo of the loop populates up on the drum kit as a pattern. Which, to be completely fair, I think would be a great idea. Even if tempo syncing wouldn’t exactly be much of a thing, and it might require redoing some of the demos, to have that pattern pre-populate up when the drum kit is loaded would be a great way to build off of a loop, almost like dragging and dropping a drum loop audio file into the workflow and building from there. Added points for it being modifiable.</p>

            <p>I do kinda wish there was a “sort by” option when navigating through the instruments list. I’m currently very lost on where instruments are because they’re not in the order they used to be at anymore.</p>
<p>Another thing is there’s currently a minor annoyance is when selecting an instrument that’s already favorited in the main list, going back to the instrument from the home view automatically shows the favorited list instead of going into the previous list.</p>
<p>I should’ve mentioned this before the release of 6.5, but I was busy with irl stuffs, and couldn’t find the time to share</p>
<hr>
<p>Another thing I would like to be added is for the user to create their own demo loop, likewise what we did when expanding the list of drum kits.<br>
A very simple idea for this is to have the first loop or selected loop be the demo loop for the preset.</p>

            <p>Did the plus button always make an empty scene or did it use to make a duplicate of the current scene you were on? Maybe it’s just me but I keep pressing the plus button expecting a duplicate at the end (kinda like a reflex) only to find that it’s empty and was just making sure I wasn’t going crazy!! Haha!!</p>

            <p>Yeah but the issue was that the browser stuff looks terrible with a dark page, so we think it’s nicer that all web pages look like web pages instead of some semi-similar to the app.</p>

            <p>Agreed, i like the duplicate behaviour aswell. maybe an long klick on the plus option presents a menu with option to duplicate or create blank scene or the otherway around. Dunno but i like to have both features <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grimacing.png?v=9" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>
