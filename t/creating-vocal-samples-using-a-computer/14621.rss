    <title>Creating &quot;vocal&quot; samples using a computer</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/creating-vocal-samples-using-a-computer/14621</link>
    <description>Here is a little tutorial for Mac OSX users...

This is a little tutorial, which is a short explanation of how to generate your own vocals under OSX. Please do not expect too much: the modulation is not perfect - this does not have much to do with singing. Everything sounds more like reading. If you have better options or know tool - please participate in this tutorial.

Manual:

Open the terminal (In the Finder -&gt; Go to -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal) and enter the command

![Terminal|500x500](upload://fFEESgUgUvqAALQN2RIDuJTmYHc.png) 

***say &quot;hello&quot;***

Of course, the sound must be activated for this. You can also download and activate different voices. For this look in the system settings under &quot;dictation and language&quot; (perhaps different I have another language installed..).

You can easily select the desired voice - if it is installed - via this command:

***say -v Boing -r 160 &quot;haha - i like music&quot;***

&quot;*Boing*&quot; is the voice used here.

*-r 160* is the speed - just change the number

You can also save everything as an audio file. For this you need the following command:

***say -v Boing -o ~/Desktop/boing_audiofile.aiff -r 185 &quot;hello&quot;***

The file is then saved as aiff-file under the desktop.

Of course, this file has to be converted to a wav-file in order to use it in Auxy. For example, the program [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) could help you.

[Here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/SpeechSynthesisProgrammingGuide/FineTuning/FineTuning.html) are some helpful ways to edit some adjustments like pauses and accents.

I also used these on some of my tracks. [Check this one](https://soundcloud.com/dr-aquaman/natt) here at 4:30 or this [one](https://soundcloud.com/dr-aquaman/kill) (kill - do not kill all humans - please do not misunderstand the lyrics - the most important thing is at the end as always...)

I would not be very happy about your attempts with the say command</description>

            <p>I’ve used TTS in some songs before, most notably the intro to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eslashe/2050-ad" rel="nofollow noopener">2050 AD</a>. Also, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/xavior">@xavior</a> used them <em>amazingly</em> in his song <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/xaviormusic/sex" rel="nofollow noopener">S.E.X.</a> (this was actually the inspiration for putting the vocal chop at the beginning of 2050 AD xD)</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that Apple’s ToS doesn’t permit this method, as Siri and other Apple voices are top-quality.</p>
