    <description>Auxy and the op 1 have very much in common the main difference is that the op 1 is played live as auxy is not . I don’t care about the idea of money I just want to know what your thoughts are,thanks?</description>

            <p>I wouldn’t use an OP-1 over Auxy mainly because of the price and because i’m not the right customer who would buy this.</p>

            <p>Ah, well yeah, I still think the same thing. They’ve got very different use cases. I’d argue if you’re concerned strictly about portability, Auxy is superior, because it runs on a device that fits in your pocket. I don’t think I’m slipping an OP1 in my pocket any time soon. But we’re also talking software vs hardware, apples and oranges. So I’m really not sure I can objectively answer lol…</p>
<p>If I was seriously looking for a portable piece of hardware, I’d probably consider the OPZ over the OP1. OPZ integrates very nicely with other apps on iOS (AUM comes to mind) and supports midi bluetooth out of the box (not sure about OP1?) – it’s also less than half the price, and has other features I’d never use (photomatic, unity integration, DMX lighting track etc). Just seems to give more.</p>

            <p>I guess I’m just a bit curious on why you would use a op 1 over auxy Vice versa</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. I definitely should have been more clear in my question as was more ask about the portability of the machines as they are both portable but very different. Which would you choose was my question</p>

            <p>The OP-1 is very expensive, to say the least. The product is out of my price range, especially knowing that the OP-1 is modular (?).</p>
<p>You mentioned in your post, and correct me if I’m wrong, Auxy isn’t used for live performances. I think you are correct in that regard, but you got to remember that the OP-1 is in a league of it’s own. It’s in a whole different universe compared to Auxy</p>

            <p>These are two very very very different things.</p>
<p>They are similar in that they both make sounds, the similarities end there though. Auxy is more like a groovebox, OP1 more like an instrument. Don’t think it has a proper sequencer but the tape looper? They can’t even talk to each other which is a bummer because no midi in for Auxy.</p>
<p>Anyway, to answer the original question, I wouldn’t choose one in lieu of the other. They fill very different niches</p>
