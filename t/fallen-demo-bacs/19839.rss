    <title>Fallen (Demo) - Bacs</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/fallen-demo-bacs/19839</link>
    <description>Hey, its been a while since I posted something. This track was originally a demo but the genre of the song suddenly I changed it to different one. I was not quite satisfied so I renamed it to “Waiting Shed”, a song that I include from my latest album Anela. 

And this project was made a year ago. I played around it which supposed to be a Lo-Fi track but anyway it did ended a lofi track. Give me some opinion about this demo. [Fallen (Demo)](https://soundcloud.com/bacs-molina17-183209610/fallen-demo-10-16-19track12)</description>
