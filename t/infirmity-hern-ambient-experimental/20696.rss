    <title>Infirmity - Hern [Ambient/Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/infirmity-hern-ambient-experimental/20696</link>
    <description>New single from my upcoming album, &quot;Health,&quot; in which I will be taking a more ambient and less sample-driven approach to my usual experimental stuff on this account. I am looking forward to releasing more music like this in 2021.

As usual, I hope you people can find some enjoyment out of the stuff I put out. Constructive criticism is also welcome (encouraged, really) as always.</description>
