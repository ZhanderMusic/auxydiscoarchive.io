    <title>Spirit Collapse/Decomposition - Hern [Genre?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/spirit-collapse-decomposition-hern-genre/20736</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a new track from my upcoming album, &quot;Health.&quot; I&#39;ve been taking a much more ambient direction on this one, but this final track kind of diverts from the more low key sound of the rest of the album. I&#39;m not quite sure what genre this (I know it falls under the blanket &quot;electronic&quot; and has some experimental/ambient elements, but besides that I&#39;m not sure).

Hope you guys enjoy, constructive criticism is welcomed as always. Album will be coming soon.</description>
