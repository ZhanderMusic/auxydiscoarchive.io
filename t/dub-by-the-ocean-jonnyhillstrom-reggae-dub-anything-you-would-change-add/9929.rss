            <p>Lol this is awesome. I have no idea how much of this is Auxy but frankly I don’t care. I think this resonates with me especially because I’ve been listening to a ton of jungle and ragga jungle which owes A LOT to this genre.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’d change anything, the vocals might be a little loud (they almost sound overdriven a little) - I think everything else seems ok.</p>
<p>Real nice man <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1/3.png?v=5" title=":+1:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t3:"></p>
