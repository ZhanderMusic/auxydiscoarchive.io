    <title>Double Deux - James Lucien &amp; Kerfuffle</title>

This song is sort of a remix/remastering of one of my first songs using Auxy. I never put it on SC because it wasn&#39;t that good and I didn&#39;t have one at the time. It&#39;s my second collab with @Kerfuffle and he did such a fantastic job helping me rework the song into something much more amazing.

((BTW if anyone wants to help me genre-classify the song gets brownie points! ^w^))</description>

            <p>It was my pleasure JFalc! It’s always fun working with you!</p>
<p>Everybody should take a real close look at his theory, it’s actually nuts! I’m always baffled at how he comes up with the most insane progressions and keys.</p>
<p>This track I hardly wanted to touch his piano, so I took the subtle approach to filling in around it. It turned out fantastic and I couldn’t be happier with the outcome of his dissonance being brought forth and the taking it’s role as the key element.</p>
<p>This isn’t the last collab between us, that’s for sure.</p>
