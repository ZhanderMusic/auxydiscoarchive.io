            <p>The “demos” on the featured tracks are actually what really helped me to learn different genres of music. In the beginning, I wanted to learn how to make a certain sound in that one song,but I couldn’t figure it out. It was in looking at these demo projects that I learned to make good chords, or wubs, or which sound packs I wanted to invest in.</p>
<p>Overall, the demo projects are really important to get beginners learning faster.</p>

<p>You can actually opt-in to notifications for the ‘feature request’ threads here.<br>
Seems a little redundant to put it in the Auxy app too.</p>

            <p>Speaking as someone who very rarely looks at the Feed (I hadn’t looked in there since the AP-007 release and I’d never looked at How To until today)…</p>
<p>I’m curious to know what the plan ultimately is for the Feed.</p>
<p>Is the intention to make it something people spend more time viewing/browsing – e.g. a content destination?<br>
…or still keep it light and brief (1 or 2 posts per week), but just make the content more centred on what users want to see?</p>

            <p>That would not be a great idea. The point of the feed, afaik, is to make announcements about Auxy and further discussion takes place on Auxy Disco. It’s not to hard to go to this website from auxy.</p>

            <p>Just kicking the can on where the Auxy feed is accessible from, like from a desktop browser, etc. Nothing really crazy important</p>

            <p>It’s nice to learn new tricks by looking at demo projects, but BTC and Auxy announcements are more important. I’d like some sort of soundpack teaser maybe a few days before they come out as well.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t saying it was against people’s best interest. I don’t think you’re going against people’s best interest either. I am sorry if I was coming off that way.</p>
<p>It’s more of a personal thing that things I feel are important aren’t a priority and, to be quite fair, aren’t really as much of a priority as other things, such as full automation on the new drum settings, tempo automation, different time signatures, etc.</p>
<p>I really wasn’t intending it to be something negative.</p>

<p>I’ve answered my personal opinions on this before. I fully support the direction the app is taking. I still feel like there’s something lost with the direction the app is going, but I never would believe it’s against the best interest of those who use this app. And I apologize that it appeared that way. If I wanted the app for free, I wouldn’t have purchased it for 5$ when it first released on the app store so long ago c:</p>

            <p>I don’t appreciate how you always seem to assume that we’re doing things against people’s best interest, whether it’s related to featuring tracks, building new features, charging for the app, etc.</p>

            <p>Perhaps having a vote with these tens of thousands of people in order to decide what sort of features they want most from the app would help push the app forward.</p>
<p>Not suggesting new things, but voting on a set number of possible features they want prioritized. I think that’d be nice to see, as some things that have been requested for a long time could <strong>finally</strong> become a priority.</p>
