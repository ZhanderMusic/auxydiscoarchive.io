    <description> Hey, I&#39;m switching to Mac and I am not sure which music program to go with. I don&#39;t even really know what I&#39;m looking for. (Prices don&#39;t scare me, I&#39;ve dropped hundreds and hundreds of dollars on music in the past.)</description>

            <p>Yep, I just tried it today actually after having used bootcamp with it and there’s an awful lot kinda wonky with it (which is to be expected).

<p>FL’s definitely good, but it’s not completely out for Mac yet (it’s currently in beta testing). You can get it with Bootcamp (Use Windows on a Mac). They explain it better than I do: <a href="https://support.image-line.com/action/knowledgebase?ans=114" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Is FL Studio available for Mac - macOS ?</a></p>

            <p>Then you learn the DAW? isnt that what you are supposed to do. besides the ammount of features you get with suite edition. better than FL or Logic imo. as well as this having the intro would be useful for people who are starting out. (even then I would recommend getting the full features so you dont have to spend more in the long run) if you want to upgrade you would spend more in the long run.</p>
<p>For someone who wants to go more professional into music either pursuing music as a carrer either in production or sound engineering I would propose getting a full studio to higher your experience. Ableton instruments are good cause they just work really well along with being not overly expensive either, because of their simplistic view it would really strip the learners experience doen to the fundamentals which encourages them to explore new sounds. It may be expensive but It would be worth it.</p>
<p>this is what I think anyway.</p>

            <p>The instruments are fine lol. They just look bad cause they dont have a well defined user interface. (well the old ones) things like the new wavetable are really good. its worth getting the suite</p>

            <p>yo just get ableton, it’s a lot easier to use than logic imo, but as it says above, the ableton instruments are horrible… honestly there’s not a lot that the suite version does that’s essential to making music… i have the intro version and it works just fine. focus more of your money on the vsts that you get such as serum and sylenth. those two are probably the best. nexus and avenger are good too but since you can’t really make your own presets, the presets the company gives out are overused</p>

<p>It’s definitely not WHICH tool. It’s how someone uses it and how it fits their workflow for sure</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Absolutely agreed on this. I feel that FL studio is a good transition from Auxy, but there possibly are other DAWs that work much better than it. It all depends on what works for you. (Also bias since I’m using FL studio but bleh)</p>
<p>If you’re going for a computer DAW (outside of Garageband, one that has VST compatability), I’d highly recommend obtaining the Serum wavetable synthesizer. It’s excellent and is great for designing sounds.</p>

            <p>Then again abletons suite edition comes with so much more than Logic. Tons of instruments tons of effects, Max for live where you can make your own instruments. 5k + samples. Workflow id easier imo</p>

            <p>They do enough, but Logic’s instruments do more. Analog and Operator don’t hold up against Alchemy or ES2, especially when you consider it costs 750 dollars for the Suite Version which includes these instruments but Logic has only one 200 dollar version.</p>

Operator is easily my favourite FM synth and Wavetable looks brilliant.</p>

            <p>Very Much Reccomend Ableton Live! It’s very easy and smart, a more complex version of Auxy I could say. I’d use Ableton Live but I have FL Studio. Anyways, you could use the free demo of Ableton, it won’t save projects but that helps you get more familiar with the software, besides, the first few things you make probably won’t be that good.</p>

            <p>I agree with all your points except for the Session View, which is the “clip view.”<br>
It’s actually not DJing. I know Ableton says it’s for DJing, but it’s actually for a Live PA (Live Production Act).</p>
<p>Ps. You “can” actually DJ on Ableton, but it sucks. I would suggest Traktor, or Serato for DJing.</p>

            <p>It’s definitely not WHICH tool. It’s how someone uses it and how it fits their workflow for sure <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

In GarageBand, than I think it’s safe to say it’s a good DAW. You just have to know how to use it.</p>

            <p>That’s what I thought, but if you go back to the Mac does it remember what plugin you used and put it back to an editable mode? Cause if so, THAT is slick… VERY slick.</p>

            <p>I also have a Mac, and I have used both LPX and Ableton Live 9 Standard. When I was looking for a good Mac software I did a lot of research, so I’m pretty familiar with the top DAWs and top plugins.</p>
<p>I put together a list of the pros and cons of the top 2 DAWs for Mac; Logic Pro X and Ableton Live.</p>
<p><strong>Logic Pro X</strong>:<br>
Pros:<br>
Easy to learn<br>
Plenty of features<br>
Amazing in-built synths<br>
Tons of samples<br>
Worth your money</p>
<p>Cons:<br>
Difficult MIDI programming without a keyboard<br>
Mac Only<br>
64 bit plugin support only<br>
Tough and confusing Automation</p>
<p><strong>Ableton Live</strong>:<br>
Pros:<br>
Great workflow<br>
Easy drum programming with “drum rack”<br>
Amazing in-built effects<br>
32 and 64 bit plugin support<br>
Session View for LPA and smoother creation<br>
Super easy Automation</p>
<p>Cons:<br>
Steep Learning Curve<br>
More Expensive<br>
Doesn’t come with “good” in-built synths</p>

<p>Edit: simple googley search reveals that Logic Pro is for P R O F E S S I O N A L S as it is $199, whereas GB is free. As such I’d go Logic Pro if you’re good to spend a bit more and dodge GB all together lol</p>

</aside>
<p>That pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>Garageband is more than enough to make professional music, but Logic has a much nicer workflow.</p>
