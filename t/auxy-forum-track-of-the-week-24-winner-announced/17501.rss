    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-24-winner-announced/17501</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* :icsleepers: ICSleepers 
* :arimyth: Arimyth
* :azureonyx: AzureOnyx
* :goxenar:  Goxenar
* :blakkaz: Blakaz
* :dadmother: DadMother
* :janitor: MisterMaster

Judge this week is: @Dadmother       

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p><big><strong>Who is the ‚ì¶inner?</strong></big></p>
<p>This week has been interesting, as one entry was a collaboration (rule 6: No collabs) and another was under a minute (rule 3: Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer). So unfortunately those tracks couldn‚Äôt be winners, because rules are rules.</p>
<p>Our judge this week, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/dadmother">@DadMother</a>, has chosen the winner.  Here‚Äôs his announcement: -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Track of the Week</strong>  has consistently brought out killer talent from every contributor, and this week is certainly no exception. There was a good variety of styles, which also made my choice that much harder. My  <em>Track of the Week</em>  this week goes to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/twizard">@Twizard</a> and his track ‚Äú<a href="https://soundcloud.com/twizard-official/claustrophobic-twizard">Claustrophobic</a>‚Äù! This track showcased some nifty neuroDnB with well-balanced moments of tension and release throughout. The chirping lead provided an excellent minimal-but-strong focal point in the verses, while the drop sections boasted both spaciousness and a sense of enclosure simultaneously, really living up to this track‚Äôs namesake. Great job, Twiz! And well done to every contributor! You should all be proud!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congrats Twizard for winning your first <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:"> !!!</p>

            <p>I had 2 choices to submit for the unicorn challenge, and I chose a different one, so this is the other one, and I think it is nice as well. However, it is pretty minimalistic as is part of the other challenge.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
