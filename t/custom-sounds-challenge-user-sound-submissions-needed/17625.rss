    <title>CUSTOM SOUNDS challenge! [User sound submissions needed!]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/custom-sounds-challenge-user-sound-submissions-needed/17625</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt;**HEY GUYS!**&lt;/big&gt;

So I had an idea for a challenge that we could use  to sort of revive our community here. Custom sounds have been all over [their respective thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/custom-sounds-packs-and-etc/16960?u=bobtheguyyyyy), and NotMiles has even made some ventures into the Auxy news feed.

A lot of these sounds are really cool, but a bit subjective at times. That’s why I want to make a challenge where you take select groups of sounds and make a song out of them with minimal tweaks!

The idea is I compile a list of maybe 15 custom melodic sounds and 2-3 custom drum kits made by people all throughout the community, and Beat The Clock style, you have a week to put together a track with them. The rules would be relatively simple, and I’ll flesh this out if I get enough people.

If you’re interested in having your sounds used for this challenge, let me know over Discord (BobTheGUYYYYY#9265) or DM me right here in this server. Make sure to send me a project link with some options of which sounds to use. I’m not taking anyone’s sounds without permission, so I need your guys’ help to get this challenge off the ground.

All right, see y’all later. Let me know what you think.</description>

            <p>Seems <em>totaly</em> awesome.<br>
Maybe a little more time until the deadline? There probably will be one entry.</p>
<p>By the way, this sounds fun. Can I put in multiple entries?</p>
