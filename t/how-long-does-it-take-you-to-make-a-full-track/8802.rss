            <p>It might take me a day or two to get the bare bones of a track.</p>
<p>My problem/advantage is that I’m a strong self editor. I’ll edit and add and cut for weeks — mainly because I may only have only 15 mins here and there every day.</p>
<p>I also don’t concentrate on a task for more than two hours becuase I like to move around. But the song probably takes about as long as someone working on it in a day (maybe a 10 hours all together).</p>

            <p>tracks take me like… about a half hour usually. 20-30 mins, maybe 35-40. oh, and the occasional at least one day.</p>

            <p>On weekdays 2 Hours<br>
On weekends 3 Hours</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to work on one Track each week. Then If I go into settings and see the battery usage of apps, it will tell me how much I use auxy within the past 7 days. So my current song I’m working on has about 9 hours on it. (Its sucks tho)</p>

            <p>Add a new instrument, or melody, or drum track. Even if it seems like a non-sequitur, it’s something that could poke your brain into thinking of new stuff. Hell, even adding an automation clip from another song you made to an instrument could change your entire perception of the song.</p>
<p>There was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/monkeyfist13/oil-summer-evening" rel="nofollow noopener">one track</a> I made where I wasn’t sure how to continue, so I did the automation clip thing on that and ended up with something that I thought was really cool.</p>
<p>Hope that helped, yo.</p>

            <p>I feel like my songs could improve if I spent more time on them, but whenever I try to keep working on a song after an hour or so (after I consider it “finished” I can’t.) Anybody have any advice?</p>

            <p>Honestly, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/monkeyfist13/crunk-in-c-minor" rel="nofollow noopener">I’ve made stuff in an hour.</a> It’s just really nice to make tracks, I guess. I don’t really want to get popular. I just love music. I mean, if I were to get paid for it, that’d be cool. There are tracks that take ages to produce, though. I guess it just depends on how into it I am.</p>
<p>Like the adage goes, “Art is like farting: When you can, you can; when you can’t, you can’t. And if you force it… It comes out as s*it.”</p>

            <p>My recent tracks I’ve spent 30+ hours on. That’s pretty bad compared to you guys with your amazing 10 hour songs. Mine aren’t even that great.</p>
<p>I guess the recent lack of motivation comes into play, and I’ll spend a month going back and adding touches until it’s done. These days I’ve only been opening Auxy when I’m bored. I hope soon I’ll get back in the groove, and can start pumping out tracks like I used to.</p>
<p>edit: by 30 hours I mean 30 hours total spent having the project open and doing stuff to it. And it’s probably more like 40+ now that I think of it. Idk</p>
<p>tl;dr: 30-40+ hours for me to make a track, mainly because I’m bored and unmotivated, and blah blah</p>

            <p>2-14 Days ;P, well actually, I usually create a track in about 3-5 Days, spend 6-7 perfecting it, then spend about a day creating cover art, thinking of a title, and uploading <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>When I first started, about a day. But now, it usually takes a full month or more to put something out.</p>

            <p>…A month or two</p>
<p>But some days I can think of a track in a couple hours. Very rarely though.<br>
Fun fact that one of my tracks, kicoh, was created in less than 2 hours.</p>

            <p>I can make songs in a day, but I still go back and fine tune them, and I also wait for the right time to release them.</p>
<p>…I have way too many as-of-yet unreleased demos.</p>
