    <title>Did anyone recreate the drum kits from Auxy Jam to Auxy Pro?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/did-anyone-recreate-the-drum-kits-from-auxy-jam-to-auxy-pro/19937</link>
    <description>As the title says, I&#39;m looking for a Pro project that recreates the drums from Auxy Jam into Auxy Pro.

I&#39;m well aware that Auxy Jam uses the same drum samples as Auxy Pro, and that Auxy Jam has 16 slots for each sample and would like to use those kits in Auxy Pro

I&#39;ve started to recreate the Transcendent Kit from Jam in Pro, but still looking for the same samples used in Jam</description>
