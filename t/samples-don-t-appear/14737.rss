    <title>Samples don’t appear</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/samples-don-t-appear/14737</link>
    <description>Ok,  I have a couple samples, wav files, five seconds each, I export them to the Auxy folder in iCloud, I’ve checked the samples folder and they’re definitely in there, but no matter what I do when I open the iCloud in Auxy  to load samples into an empty drum kit, they’re not there. 

I tried closing and reopening the project, still not there. I have many samples and successfully loaded in the past, first time I’ve had this problem. Any idea why?</description>
