    <title>GreyOldTwit - Who We Are VIP [Progressive, Future Bass?]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/greyoldtwit-who-we-are-vip-progressive-future-bass/15020</link>
    <description>A remake of my fifth track ever made. I know there has been suggestions of adding vocals to the track; so if you still want vocals to be included, I’ll try my best to get them and reupload.
