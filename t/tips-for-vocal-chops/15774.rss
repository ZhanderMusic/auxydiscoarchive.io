            <p>Yeah, I looked and found the pack on Blackoctopus as well. I may try to find the actual stems if I were to really want to make full use of them as far as how I’d <em>want</em> to use them (I’m not the typical user of course take that with a grain of salt).</p>
<p>That being said, the tutorial I linked can help give a good idea of what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>As a side note, the actual stems of the chops themselves are tuned to key, but not the actual notes being sung, as they change throughout the stem they were chopped up from. So trying to get it to fit with a melody can/will be extra frustrating.</p>

            <p>Yeah these are not vocals. They aren’t meant to be vocals. They’re just chops.</p>
<p>I stumbled across this same pack on loopmasters I think it was, was just poking around. There’s actually stems for twelve full songs in the full pack, but obviously working with full length stems in Auxy is kind of a nightmare (not just Auxy, this is a common problem in any groovebox style app that doesn’t use a linear sequencer. Gadget is in the same exact boat).</p>
<p>Anywho, just my two pence. They will be largely unsatisfying if you’re trying to use them as vocals.</p>

            <p>Are you looking for in terms of the vocal chops <em>in Auxy</em>, or just in general?</p>
<p>If you’re looking for in general, I’d recommend this guy’s tutorial. He’s the same guy who did those “How to [Genre] in 3 minutes or less!” videos on Youtube, and it’s quite helpful.<br>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVB8Ztyfifg?autoplay=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque">https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVB8Ztyfifg</a></p>
<p>In terms of what Auxy provides… good luck. I’ve tried to do it but it just ends up too frustrating for me, due to the division of the samples being already hard enough to work with sometimes. But if you’re just going for something simple and not more lyrical, you’re probably best just studying the Intonations demo from Phluze. It really gives a good overview of how to get freaky with them <em>in Auxy</em>.</p>
