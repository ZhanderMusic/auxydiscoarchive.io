    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/swapped-sounds-challenge-closed/9264</link>
    <description>New challenge from Osharu Perez! Make a song, like you would any other regular song, except for the fact that you have to use the bass for your leads and your leads for your bass. Drum Kits are...Drum Kits...Anyways, make a song with the bass sounds being your leads, and your lead sounds being your bass! Can&#39;t wait to hear what you come up with! **ONLY REPLY IF YOU ARE ENTERING THIS CONTEST!!**  You can post the project file here once your done, OR you can release your project, and post the SoundCloud link on here. Good luck!

Instead of using bass for bass, use bass for leads, and use leads for bass.
