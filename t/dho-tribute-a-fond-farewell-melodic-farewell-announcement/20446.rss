    <title>DHO - Tribute (A Fond Farewell) [Melodic] + Farewell Announcement</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/dho-tribute-a-fond-farewell-melodic-farewell-announcement/20446</link>
    <description>Hey, everyone! ;P 

Unfortunately, I&#39;m no longer going to be running tournaments here at the Disco, due to a variety of reasons. Mainly due to the dwindling activity on the Disco and my interests moving away from electronic music. I whipped up one last track as a tribute to the Auxians who inspired me in the early days to work hard and hone my skills, and who still inspire me to this day.  I wonder, can you guess who each section is a tribute to?

Best wishes!
