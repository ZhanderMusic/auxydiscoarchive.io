    <title>Rocca - Off My Face [Hardcore]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/rocca-off-my-face-hardcore/14953</link>
    <description>Hey guys! Been a while since I created a track, but here’s another song for the “mdma” album. This one features a jumpy bassline and smooth melodies.

I am thinking about creating a VIP mix with the piano towards the end of the track.

Let us know what ya think!
