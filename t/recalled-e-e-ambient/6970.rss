    <title>Recalled - E/E [Ambient]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/recalled-e-e-ambient/6970</link>

Now I know what you all are thinking, &quot;Oh jeez he&#39;s made another song! It must be bad since it&#39;s so soon after his last song!&quot; But listen, hear me out on this one. It&#39;s not actually bad either ;3

I had this song planned for last wednesday, the day before the drum update because it was ready and I wanted to release it then. However, some things came up. Such as the update actually releasing Wednesday, my [eXodus Chamber release](https://soundcloud.com/exoduschamber/waveform) with @MrSerpent, and the fact that this song originally was going to be that release. However, the update happened a day early for me, so that threw me off. Also me and Mr. Serpent went with a different idea built off of the demo for this track. They may sound similar in that way.

This track is based more on Moemx&#39;s style of ambient, while the release on eXodus is more influenced by Stereofield&#39;s style of ambient. They&#39;re sort of like a musical equivalent to siblings. Anyway, with that little bit of exposition out of the way, enjoy my newest release, &quot;Recalled&quot;.</description>
