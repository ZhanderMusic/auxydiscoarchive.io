    <description>i&#39;m curious to see, do all the ppL making trance, or house, techno music, etc. do u think making that type of music as a beginner made u a better music producer overall? meaning, if u can make a sicc trance dubstep track, can u make anything? like hip hop beat or trap.. cuz i see ther&#39;s a ton of crazy sh%t in techno track compared to a hip hop beat.  i don&#39;t listen to techno, but it&#39;s cool.. i jus love rap/hip-hop &amp; r&amp;b..but shud i learn to make wat u guys are makin to become a better artist?</description>

            <p>Trap, Trance, and House is a whole lot simpler than making Dubstep. I learned how to make dubstep on a PC DAW and I can do alot of genres now but I still don‚Äôt know how to make a jazzy track. I can also try making a trap beat but without vocals, I dont have anything to put in the trap beat.</p>
<p>This was all in FL studio though so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend trying to learn one genre to learn them all. All you really need to do in Auxy is pick good sounds and a kick set and then place notes and then sidechain. Sound design and mastering is already done for you. Its simple and nice</p>

            <p>That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing, I like rap and all, but I‚Äôm spreading out and trying all sorts of things in Auxy and I‚Äôm learning more than I ever thought I could because of it. You can check out my soundcloud, I‚Äôm about to drop a song that I‚Äôm extremely proud of. And I‚Äôm sure if I make a rap beat now, it would be a lot more interesting!</p>

            <p>I agree with the previous poster. Don‚Äôt worry about genres, just make the music that moves you. The music that is fun to make for you.</p>

            <p>You don‚Äôt have to make what everyone else is making, it all depends on what you like and feel you‚Äôre good at making, and in the end <strong>you</strong> have to love the music you create</p>

            <p>Do all kind of music what you like - put a lot of your feelings (bad or good) in it and your music becomes better. I like rock and orchestral music, but can write in pretty all genres. One thing - it must be sincerely. So for beginner in my opinion best way to create good music it‚Äôs find some harmony in process of music making. If you find it, you will find satisfaction in what you doing. Put emotions in your work and it will alive;)</p>
