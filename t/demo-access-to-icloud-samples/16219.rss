    <title>Demo Access to iCloud Samples</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/demo-access-to-icloud-samples/16219</link>
    <description>Recently, I went back to a demo user with all the limited sounds; but I’m not here to complain about that.

An issue I have as a demo user is with iCloud Samples. Usually this option is for Auxy Subscribers, but I was able to access this option and choose whatever samples I want. However, once I chose my sample (and left the edit loop section), I am instantly locked out of that Drum Kit. And instantly, I wasted an instrument and can not delete it.</description>

            <p>Seems like a glitch. I can import sounds, and audition them, but when I try to assign it to a drum slot the it doesn’t work. The sample is grayed out too. Maybe reboot device? Failing that I’d email <a href="mailto:feedback@auxy.co">feedback@auxy.co</a> and file bug report.</p>
