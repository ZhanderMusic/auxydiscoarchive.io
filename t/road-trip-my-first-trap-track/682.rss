    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/road-trip-my-first-trap-track/682</link>
    <description>Here is my first trap track that i&#39;ve ever made. You are welcome to enjoy and mess around with it as much as you want, but take note that the original will be posted on IG, SoundCloud, and maybe Facebook (idk). You may also post whatever you&#39;ve done to the track in the comments, I&#39;m excited to see what kind of skill you guys have in ya. Alright now, see ya later, love you all, and stay tuned for more...

            <p>Bro that drop is straght fiyyyaaahhhhhh!!! I think Road trip doesn’t match the vibes, something like Cent or Clarity or Vibrance (i know, I know but it’s my top pick out of the three.<br>
Will attempt to remix, although you will be hearing sounds from only the original pack, I haven’t bought anything yet <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
