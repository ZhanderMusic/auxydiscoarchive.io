            <p>I used garageband for vocals, the rest was on Auxy. I am glad you enjoyed the track!</p>

            <p>Listening again, I really like this a lot and I enjoyed your vocal performance. I think you‚Äôve got a good voice man. If I had anything meaningful to write lyrically I‚Äôd give it a spin but I really have nothing to say haha.</p>
<p>Did you end up exporting stems to another software/DAW? Cause I can‚Äôt imagine it would be much fun to do this much vocal work in Auxy given the current setup <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Awesome, I listened this morning but when I have time I gotta listen again. I like it! You did a good job I think, especially once the synths come in it all gels together very nicely.</p>
<p>Everyone watch out for this guy he‚Äôs got it together <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/triumph.png?v=5" title=":triumph:" class="emoji" alt=":triumph:"></p>

            <p>Thank you, I was a little insecure at first, then I realized what the purpose of the song was‚Ä¶ to ensure the listener understands the singer‚Äôs feelings. Hopefully I was able to convey that throughout the song.</p>
