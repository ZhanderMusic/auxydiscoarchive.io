    <title>Does anyone have tips to make [genre unknown]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/does-anyone-have-tips-to-make-genre-unknown/15341</link>
    <description>I love this song so much
It’s like a mixture of future bass and something else but I’m not sure how to make it
Melody and chord wise it’s extremely hard for me to make something like this

If anyone can make melodies, chord progressions, drums and other things or give tips it would really help a lot
Thanks in advance..</description>

            <p>Chord ideas:</p>
<p>Use major seventh or ninth chords (for the chords in this key that are major, except for the V chord).<br>
Use minor seventh chords (for the chords in this key that are minor).<br>
Use a VI7 chord to lead into a ii7 chord.<br>
Use a I7 (dominant 7th) chord to lead into a IVmaj7 chord.</p>
<p>here are some examples:<br>

<p>you’ll find a lot of this stuff in conux or kayasho’s music</p>
