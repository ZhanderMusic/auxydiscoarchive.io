            <p>If you have the Demo, use sounds like spray and make the pitch bend up as a riser for the build of the drop. also use snare or hi-hat rolls. For the drop, use dirt (lowpass down for a sub,) and barber for a driving bass, and use mascara for the chords. Use spray a driving lead and make it more pleasing by adding pitch bend.for the subscription, use whatever alternitive you want, just make sure you add sweeper for a more smooth transition. if you want a demo project explaining it more, message me. i know that this isnt very descriptive, but its the basics to having a good drop.</p>

            <p>What could I do that would make my drops and melodies in future more interesting? Is there any tips that you could give me? Most of the songs on the disco are very interesting but mine seem to be (like you said) generic. Any tips would be appreciated <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=6" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p>If you wanted you could Message me if you wanted to go in depth (which would be awesome)</p>

            <p>Nice chords, kind of basic, but that doesn‚Äôt hurt anything. Nice use of the new slap basses. I like the melody and use of instrument there. Nice ‚ÄúKilobyte?‚Äù before the drop. Drop is okay. I feel like more could have been done with it. It‚Äôs not BAD per say, just kind of‚Ä¶ generic? Nice track though. I‚Äôll have to check more of your stuff out.|</p>
<p>Chords/Melody: 5/10<br>
Drums: 6/10<br>
Arrangement: 6/10<br>
Mixing/Mastering: 7/10<br>
Appeal: 7/10</p>
<p>Overall: 31/50 (Not bad.)</p>
