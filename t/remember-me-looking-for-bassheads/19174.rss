    <title>Remember Me? (Looking for bassheads)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/remember-me-looking-for-bassheads/19174</link>
    <description>Hey Auxy fam! 

Remember your ol&#39; pal, IVO (now Xavior.. but I think people are gradually warming up to that still :sweat_smile:)? I&#39;m working on some brand new projects, as quarantine has given me the time and energy to invest into some new ideas. I haven&#39;t really been in touch with anyone here for a hot minute because, well, life happens. BUT, I&#39;d love to hear from you and see if anyone&#39;s been cookin&#39; up some bassy $*** lately! Am I still the bass dad or have I been replaced? :joy:

I hope everyone&#39;s happy and healthy during this uneasy time! Wishing you all well, and hope to hear from your lovely faces, both new and old!

Cheers!
Xavior</description>

            <p>I listened to “The Good Part” and I think the song is great! It wouldn’t necessarily go with my style as Xavior, but I’m working on music through a different alias that would be able to incorporate your style perfectly. DM me privately if you’re interested and we’ll see if we can work something out.</p>
