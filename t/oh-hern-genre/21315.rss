            <p>I like it, especially where the chord progression wanders off around the two minute mark. Nice.</p>
<p>Genre-wise, tricky to pin it down.<br>
My first thought was that it had a complex Pop production style to it. I also felt that it might sit well amongst some artists commonly grouped under Downtempo.</p>
<p>…or somewhere in between the two.</p>

<p>Either way, I liked it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=10" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
