    <title>Bad soundcloud uploads</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/bad-soundcloud-uploads/2036</link>
    <description>Do you guys sometimes also scroll all the way down through your soundcloud page, listen to all your uploaded tracks, and repeatedly think: &#39;Wow this is so bad&#39;. I have this for several of my uploaded tracks, and I&#39;m seriously considering deleting them from my soundcloud page. 

Is this familiar to some of you, or am I the only one?
