    <title>How do you get out of Producer Block</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-do-you-get-out-of-producer-block/16183</link>
    <description>I’ve been really uninspired to produce music lately, I haven’t made a track in 2 months and I’m not exactly sure if I want to keep producing or not...I guess this is less of producer block and more like producer slump, any tips? Just wondering what you guys do when you feel like this.</description>

            <p>What I do is wait for a shower thought to appear in my head, let’s hope that you don’t forget it before writing it down.</p>
<p>But real talk, there are many ways to escape Producer Block. What I do is listen to some unique songs and get ideas from them. If that doesn’t work, then you could use a chord auto-generating software that makes a chord for you. That sometimes give me ideas for a song.</p>

            <p>I just try a new genre that sounds interesting or that I’ve listened to a little bit before. It’s often pretty fun to try something completely new and original, rather than try to make a similar song in the same genre.</p>

            <p>I have two solutions for when I hit a block.</p>
<p>Solution one is simple, and involves throwing sh*t at a project until it makes good noise. This doesn’t always work, but I find that when it does it works <em>well</em>. And I mean really well. Some of my best work comes from that breakthrough push, even if the build-up is painful.</p>
<p>Second solution is also simple, but extremely difficult to do (at least for me.)</p>
<p>Cut yourself off from all music, or as close to as you can get. After a day or so, my head is just filled with melodies and ideas for music and I honestly can’t put that feeling into words. It’s not easy to go that long without music, however, so I tend to forego it.</p>
<p>Never listen to another person’s work for inspiration <strong>during a block</strong>. It just leads to endless procrastination.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you’re producing for the right reasons. Find what drives you when you are motivated, and try to remember that feeling. Hope I was somewhat helpful.</p>

            <p>The only thing that stops me from producing a great beat is laziness, but once I dig into it I find myself getting myself super inspired. Also I find temperature has to do a lot with inspiration.</p>

            <p>Jeez I have this same problem, and literally haven’t posted my own original song in around 9 months now. Collabs help, since I haven’t had to make an entire song, I just have to contribute to an existing idea.</p>
<p>I have a ton of ideas and drops and whatnot sitting around in my library—probably close to 25-30 projects, and some of them are decent, but in my mind, they need so much tweaking and work that I just end up finding new inspiration for some idea before I put the work in to finish what I just started. Cue this cycle for all of my school year, and I’ve got unfinished tracks that could probably make 3-4 full EPs or albums if I actually finished them.</p>
<p>Mostly, I just take a break if I’m feeling terrible about my current projects, or just move on to a new idea and have some fun with that, I guess.</p>

            <p>For producers block, I’d say, take a break for a while; go outside, take a bike ride, do something other than music for a while. (Sometimes I’ll take a two day to two week break.) When you come back, you come up with stuff you never thought you could.</p>
<p>For producers slump, I’d say everyone here has answered it pretty well. Force your self to make something, even if it isn’t that good. Your brain will get back into that flow and start making stuff again, and like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/obexg">@obexg</a> said, try collabing with other people, their styles might inspire you. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>This was me for the past five months<br>
What I did was force myself to produce, even if it was just one track a month. I forced myself to make tracks, even if it was a simple melody, I would create the whole song around that melody! I still have this producers block, but I’m slowly getting out of it. Matter of fact, I’ve started working on some lo-fi stuff recently, a genre I’ve never dabbled before in! Best of luck to you!</p>

            <p>I usually just search up different genres of music as it frees my mind up to think differently.

            <p>When I get stuck, I often force myself to put ideas down, even though I KNOW they’re bad. It’s always when I feel like I’m not gonna come up with a good project and I put barely any effort into an idea when I’m stuck that i end up doing something that I like, and even if that idea goes nowhere it helps me feel a bit more motivated. It gives me that little push of ‘oh hey, I tried (or didn’t really try <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:">) and came up with something half decent! Not for everyone, but it’s worth a shot. Just force yourself to put LITERALLY ANYTHING down. Eventually something might click.</p>

            <p>I’ve been really uninspired to produce music lately, I haven’t made a track in 2 months and I’m not exactly sure if I want to keep producing or not…I guess this is less of producer block and more like producer slump, any tips? Just wondering what you guys do when you feel like this.</p>
