    <title>Vocal requests accepted now! Mic is working again!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/vocal-requests-accepted-now-mic-is-working-again/7149</link>
    <description>I already have a list, but I can add to it if needed. For the time being, since there is a list, I might be charging about $10 a track. Something cheap so if you dont like it, you wont feel cheated. And I know most of you don’t work, so I apologize but the price may drop in the near future. Hopefully, I can get some money though. Who’s up?

[EDIT] Due to popular demand, I shall not charge for vocals. Just ask, and you shall recieve. Do keep in mind, I have a list of people I&#39;m doing vocals for, so I may not get to you immediately</description>

            <p>Well, I might start charging when I get a bit bigger as an artist. Until then, it’ll be out there</p>

            <p>Bro, I think you should charge.<br>
You are providing a service that many EDM producers don’t have: words.</p>
<p>I mean, you don’t have to charge all the time, and if you do charge, you don’t have to charge that much.</p>

            <p>Just fyi, your title is a bit confusing</p>
<p>If you’re accepting vocals, wouldn’t that mean that you want people to sing for you?</p>
