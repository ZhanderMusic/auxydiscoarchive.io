    <title>Unfound - Gamma Rays [Chillsynth, Synthwave] [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/unfound-gamma-rays-chillsynth-synthwave-wip/13124</link>
    <description>Hey guys!
I&#39;m working on a new track and would like some feedback on what I can add/change on it, as I feel that it&#39;s almost there in terms of it being finished, but I still feel like it could have a bit more added to it. Thanks!

            <p>i can’t find anything wrong… why have i not heard of you before! we need to talk sometime, i also make synthwave (poorly, but i try)… i digress; the track is finished in my book! i really don’t hear anything i would change except maybe vary the drums a tiny bit</p>
