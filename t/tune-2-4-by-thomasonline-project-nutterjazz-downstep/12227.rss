    <description>I haven&#39;t been creating music for over 8 years, when I was working as DJ and having fun with production in Reason. Auxy gave me this chance again. I usually use it between other tasks or on my way to work in the subway. Anyway enjoy my first fully finished track made with Auxy:

            <p>Thanks!<br>
By the way. I found few mistakes in bass line, few minutes ago. &amp; its kind of hype to make it on the run so these kinds of things happen… Anyway thanks again.</p>
