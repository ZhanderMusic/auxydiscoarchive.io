    <title>T3CH [Collab?] - For an upcoming event</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/t3ch-collab-for-an-upcoming-event/8860</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&#39;m still getting use to the Forum community layout and I&#39;m probably doing this wrong, but as a bit of introduction to myself; I am glad that I can say that I am part of this community and I have been using Auxy for little over 2 years. I grew up listening to Deadmau5 and Pete Tong, and I&#39;ve always had a knack for music but I couldn&#39;t ever put it on paper. Auxy allows me to do so, but I will admit that I am currently stuck on a project, it is for my senior graduation and my song will be played there. I have made the majority of the song but it is just missing a few things and I need a second opinion. I am open to collaborations and what not, but not too sure if you can dm me... still haven&#39;t figured that out yet. Anyways, if you have gotten this far, thank you and I look forward to hearing you.

p.s. how do I reply on posts, I dont see the reply button anywhere... 
thanks</description>
