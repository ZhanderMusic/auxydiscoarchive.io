    <title>Messaging on Here as opposed to SoundCloud</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/messaging-on-here-as-opposed-to-soundcloud/3097</link>
    <description>Hey guys, hope you&#39;re having a nice day!
This topic is mainly on what&#39;s more convenient for me but I&#39;m betting the same might be true for many others. I would just like everyone to know that it is probably better to message on this forum than the provided SoundCloud messaging interface, primarily because many users like myself are always on their mobile device and rarely have access to a computer, so for the sake of convenience, I think that any requests for remixes or collabs would be a lot more efficient on here, at least for me, because you can access it from literally almost anything with internet, as opposed to desktop only with SoundCloud.

Just wanted to throw that out there.</description>

            <p>Just messaged you on SoundCloud and then saw this… well here’s the message:</p>
<p><em>Hey aUstin!</em></p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of your tracks, and I know it’s a long shot to ask… but would you like to do a collab w/ me?</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to hear what kind of music I typically make, you can listen to Believe and my remix of Conux’s Kleuren.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks,</em><br>
<em>SanaB</em></p>
