    <description>[AKA.SND - Antifragile [Electronic, Electronic, IDM, Witch House?]](https://soundcloud.com/heathenaka/antifragile-demo)

Got things I should be doing instead, but the basis came to me on the journey home last night and wanted to explore it.
This piece is the result of a few hours from today — to give it some form.

Starting to play more with samples for melodies. Makes a real difference, imo.

&lt;s&gt;WIP/Draft. (Mix levels certainly need some attention, but I put it on SC so I can actively/passively listen to it over the next few days, and get some feedback, ahead of changes.)&lt;/s&gt;

Thoughts, comments, feedback, would be good. :+1:</description>

<p>There’s so many little nuances</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve just done an edit, adding a new melody to the 1:37–2:07 section, to give it a little more interest and energy (compared to the previous 16 bars).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day you release a final complete Auxy Track without it being a “sketch”, “demo” or WIP, will be a momentous occasion!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m actually thinking I might make this one my first actual release (Spotify, iTunes, etc…).</p>
<p>I’m quite happy with it, and think it might have some legs as a track. So, rather than wait until I can engineer it ‘properly’, I’m gonna pull the trigger and get it out there properly.</p>
<p>I’m now on the lookout for appropriate streaming playlists and promo channels (incl. YT) to <s>pimp</s> submit it to.</p>
<p>…and I need to rustle up a proper logo and some proper cover art too.</p>

            <p>‘Witch House’ isn’t actually a form of House music.<br>
(Links earlier in this thread.)</p>
<p>It’s generally heavy, dark electronic that typically comes bundled with fx-laden vocals and sometimes occult visuals or references - hence the Witch part.</p>
<p>Tbh, I’m not sure where ‘House’ comes into it.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it used in reference to Lorn, and rejected. This thing is, strip out the occult stuff and it’s not a million miles away from what this track is.</p>
<p>Generically calling it Electronic doesn’t really seem like it’s adding anything useful, imo.</p>
<p>Ish.</p>

            <p>I don’t know what “Witch House” is at all, but this track isn’t House.<br>
It doesn’t have that steady 4 on the Floor beat, at 120-130 bpm.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Really do appreciate it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I agree with the ‘good mixing’. Sounds a little all over the place to my ears, lacking any subtlety.<br>
That said, I do have a knack for making stuff worse when I try to mix ‘properly’ in Ableton.</p>
<p>I’ll try to not listen to it for a day or two, and visit it again with fresh(er) ears.</p>
<p>Well, after a couple more listens. After all, there are a couple of issues that definitely need attention (the Gravel clicking), etc… plus I’m still kinda in that ‘afterglow’ and really enjoy listening to it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Oh Jesus at first listen I thought the viola was tonsil lol… yes, I love doing stuff like that. Like in a four minute long track or whatever you just introduce an element once. And then you don’t use it again for the rest of the track.</p>
<p>Listened again on headphones (listened in the truck this morning), those drums hooked me again immediately haha. I know I’m basically just repeating myself but great work. Btw sounded good in both the car and in headphones so good mixing <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> even though it’s labeled draft / wip</p>

<p>16 bar segments</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course. I should clarify.</p>
<p>I never have any single segment/‘loop’ running for 16 bars.<br>
I typically change/add/remove/build/reduce after 8, at most.</p>
<p>What I meant, on this instance, was that I had an 8-bar* segment which had a prominent new lead melody – that had no melodic connection either side. It’s kind of a standalone 8-bar* melody – only getting a single play-through.</p>
<p>I think it’s the absence of that second play-through that’s the main revelation for me. I tend to allow the listener at least two chances to hear any prominent melody.</p>
<p>It’s a small thing, but for me, it’s new. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
* Technically, it’s a 4-bar melodic segment, as the effective tempo is actually 63.5bpm (rather than the 127 used within Auxy). I’ll probably nudge it to 128/64bpm.</p>

            <p>For what it’s worth I never ever ever build using 16 bar segments, never. I mean not that there’s anything wrong with it, but I feel like it keeps the pace moving and forces you to explore other ideas if you have a certain length in mind. Sometimes, it’s to my detriment because I explore all the ideas I wanted to in a piece in a two minute or so time window. But that’s ok, trying not to force myself to hit a certain length.</p>

<p>So, I’m kinda somewhere between Modeselektor and Thom Yorke. Still, those are some pretty flattering points of reference to have used with one’s music. So, no complaints. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hopefully I can carve out my own sound. I’m certainly starting to feel like I’m starting to gravitate towards certain things, that might become ‘my sound’ – or at least, ‘my sound’ for stuff produced under a certain name.</p>
<p>(Feel like I’m reaching the point where I should break off certain styles into other names [and SC accounts].)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the more prominent lead sound that comes in is great</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks. As mentioned, it’s a layered combo of around four different imported sounds (actually five, as one is duplicated and panned).<br>
With some offsetting and a touch of panning, I was able to give the lead a looser, more spacious feel.</p>
<p>It really helps add character to the piece, as one of the sounds has a slow, drunken vibrato, which isn’t currently possible within Auxy. (It’s a lo-fi characteristic I fell in love with back with Boards of Canada, and again more recently thanks to Lorn.)</p>
<p>I’ve been making a point of going through all the free and paid samples I’ve been trawling in recent months.</p>

<p>I know. Music is meant to be taking a back seat for a spell, but… but… can’t… …help… …myself. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

One of my key learnings from this track is to get past my tendency to build using 16-bar chunks.<br>
Perhaps due to how little time I’ve spent on it, I was less ‘precious’. Even so, I think it’s produced a looser, more interesting composition.</p>
<p>For instance, the section with the Viola (4:24—4:39) is only 8-bars and the lead melody has no connection with anything either side of it.</p>
<p>So, my lesson from this track is to be less precious about resolving to 16-bar segments.</p>

<p>I know what you mean about the lead and I kinda agree that it’s over-the-top at the moment. I’ll likely pull it back a bit, but not to ‘ghost’ levels.</p>
<p>I certainly need to look at all the levels. It’s a little muddy at the moment, imo, but as mentioned, it’s kinda at draft stage.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>There’s so many little nuances</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny you say that. I generally feel like my stuff lacks detailing. Adding subtle details and flourishes isn’t a strength – at least, not that I’m aware of.</p>
<p>While I’d like to be better at detailing, I’m wondering if my current amount of detailing is actually, simply a characteristic of my sound. I do enjoy simpler structures, so if this track could be considered nuanced and detailed, then perhaps this is where I should pitch my tent and consolidate the other aspects of my sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sit here smiling like a fool as each new part plays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really glad you had that experience with this piece. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That lead, …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Starting to play with tonal samples and pushing it around using Pitch Automation to make melodies.<br>
Makes such a difference to step away from the stock sounds and play with sounds I find more emotive and inspiring.</p>
<p>(I just hope they find a way to make samples ‘playable’ in an Auxy update soon.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the supporting guitar-like sounds…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool that you caught that. Adds a hint of twang. It’s not actually a guitar. It’s built using a twangy synth. Layered over the three other sounds, one of which is a kind of tube-ish, drunken woodwind and the other two are thin rezzy, it all creates a sound with a lot of character.</p>
<p>Definitely the way forward — for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the brief strings … so good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Tbh, on later listens, I’m torn whether to keep that strings bit near the end.<br>
The whole piece feels so strongly electronic/synthetic, that it seems a bit random and incongruous — kinda coming outta nowhere.</p>
<p>I’ll certainly keep that brief melody segment, but I may end up replacing the plaintive Viola with something else.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I may introduce a little of it earlier, so that it’s not so ‘outta nowhere’ later on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day you release a final complete Auxy Track without it being a “sketch”, “demo” or WIP, will be a momentous occasion!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw, there’s now a section for WIP tracks if you didn’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I somehow completely missed it. Thanks for heads up and thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/mistermaster">@MisterMaster</a> for moving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dubby wub at the beginning (not the very first one with the panning) has a little spikey thing that I can’t really explain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know what you mean. The low, rezzy Gravel bass ‘wub’ is clicking.<br>
At first, I thought it was because I hadn’t cleaned up the Lowpass settings, so that it ends at the same level as it begins. (The ‘jump’ in the soundwave can produce an intermittent click in the sound engine.)</p>
<p>I aligned the in/out better, and it has reduced it, but not eliminated it completely, even when soloed.<br>
I guess the Auxy sound engine is struggling a bit.</p>
<p>Might need to output the wave, find a click-free loop and use that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…whatever genre that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine. I defaulted to the generic ‘electronic’. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=5" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Aside from the additional ‘IDM’ tag, I keep hearing ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDmXNcamE_Q">Witch House</a>’ used for Lorn (who’s one of my main influences at the moment). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_house_(genre)">Reading up on it</a>, it kinda fits, ish, though I don’t relate to any of the associated, occult visuals.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll use Witch House as a secondary genre. It’s close enough, imo, to be relevant and hopefully interesting enough to attract listeners of that genre.</p>
<p>‘Dark electro’ might be another one. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/man_shrugging.png?v=5" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>

            <p>Them drumsss. I’ve been digging on Thom Yorke a lot lately so this kind of drum work is right up my alley.</p>
<p>Overall a great sound, at 2:40 the more prominent lead sound that comes in is great.</p>
<p>For a few hours work this is great haha, and imo more polished than I’d expect for such a small time window. Strike while the iron is hot <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>Btw, there’s now a section for WIP tracks if you didn’t know.</p>
<p>Only one small thing that I didn’t really like about it. The dubby wub at the beginning (not the very first one with the panning) has a little spikey thing that I can’t really explain, but right when every wub starts you can hear a little tick. Very small detail but definitely look into it.</p>
<p>Other than that, I’d say that the drums can be changed up a bit, specifically maybe a quicker tap on the hi-hats. Nothing really wrong about how it is now, I just think it might sound better.</p>
<p>P.S. I really liked it. Not the typical thing I’d listen to, but it almost makes me want to get into whatever genre that is.</p>

<p>Got things I should be doing instead, but the basis came to me on the journey home last night and wanted to explore it.<br>
This piece is the result of a few hours from today — to give it some form.</p>
<p>Starting to play more with samples for melodies. Makes a real difference, imo.</p>
<p><s>WIP/Draft. (Mix levels certainly need some attention, but I put it on SC so I can actively/passively listen to it over the next few days, and get some feedback, ahead of changes.)</s></p>
