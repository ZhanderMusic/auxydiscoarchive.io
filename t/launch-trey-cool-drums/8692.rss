Here it is! My latest track. This one is very cool and I did my best to make progressive chords and smooth transitions while keeping it creative and introducing new ideas. I also used toms and the idea of an actual drum set much more, which hopefully sounds good!
Please tell me what you think and I’m open to any feedback or advice.

If you are interested in the project I’m open to requests, but I can’t guarantee that I will be able to give it to you.
