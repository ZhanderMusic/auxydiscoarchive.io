    <title>Smoke - Hern [Experimental Album]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/smoke-hern-experimental-album/19251</link>
    <description>I didn&#39;t really try to go for a consistent theme or concept on this album. This is the farthest I have gone so far with this almost entirely sample-based sound I&#39;ve been working with as of recent. This includes some of my most out-there samples.

Track list:
Powerful (2:44)
Tomb (5:27)
Falter (2:49)
Hesitation (0:50)
Smoke (30:00)
Interlude Type Beat (1:36)
Sainthood (8:34)

List of samples (for anybody curious):
Yes - Heart of the Sunrise
Cuphead OST - Railroad Wrath
Justice - Waters Of Nazareth
My guitar
Death Grips - Government Plates (Not album version, live piano cover on Twitch)
Ambient noise from outside of a school
Primus - Wynona&#39;s Big Brown Beaver
Soundgarden - Rusty Cage
Rage Against The Machine - Bulls On Parade
Weird nonsensical melodies from my way older unpublished music
Black Flag - Rise Above (But only the drum intro)
Horn section
Pantera - Cowboys From Hell
&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot; song from some strange foreign educational game that was made by the man who made LSD Dream Simulator

[Runtime is 52:02]

I hope you people enjoy, it took me a while to feel comfortable releasing this. Constructive criticism is always welcome.</description>
