    <title>Am I being scammed?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/am-i-being-scammed/8920</link>
    <description>I recently got a message on discord by someone claiming that they own a website that helps you get &quot;views&quot;. Not to mention he has very bad English. I’m not a big fan of these types of sites because I like getting natural plays. So is it a scam or not ![image|445x500](upload://bIL7zPsikeiA5Q7yY747YTBo6fI.jpeg)</description>

            <p>Yeah, that’s what made me think it might be fake. Because messaging someone that you’re gonna repost their track, is fairly normal I assume.</p>

            <p>99% chance that it’s fake and won’t contribute to much (if any) exposure increase.<br>
1% chance that there’s some vaguely legitimate aspect of it but it’s behind a paywall.</p>

<p>:sigh: I could make the exact same remark about your ‘non-dismissal’ of the OP’s question.</p>
<p>Your point isn’t complex. (Maybe we have some crossed-wires going on.)</p>
<p>We simply seem to disagree about how much detail in general, and what key detail in particular, is required to understand the offer and make an informed decision about it.</p>
<p>We also seem to disagree a little about what constitutes a categorical deal-breaker.</p>
<p>If that’s not the meat of your point, I’m genuinely interested to understand. I’m always open to the idea that I might be wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whether or not it is a “scam” as in you will be swindled out of something is perhaps a different question</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny, given that’s the OP’s original question, It’s not a different question. It’s <em><span class="bbcode-u">the</span></em> question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>verify the safety</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d be interested to hear what you believe is ‘unsafe’ about this free offer.</p>

            <p>Seems like the conversation isn’t really getting anywhere. You claim to understand the points I’m raising, but the rest of your response would suggest otherwise. I’ll put the main conclusion below, in a concise summary.</p>
<p><strong>RocketYou is a new crowdfunding / sponsoring site, which appears to have traces of legitimacy, but the time you’ll have to take to verify the safety of this method compared to the potential benefit is not worth it. There are several signs that the site is illegitimate (whether or not it is a “scam” as in you will be swindled out of something is perhaps a different question). Feel free to look into the company as it very well may be atleast somewhat legitimate, but until someone does, it is safe to say that it should be stayed away from for the time being.</strong></p>
<p>And with that, I’d call it a day. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/ok_hand.png?v=5" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"></p>

I don’t think he just took it from Google Translate. I tried translating one of the sentences from French to English and I is capitalized when it gets translated from “je”. The I’s in his message are all lowercase.<p></p>

<p>Curious. If it was such a concern for you, why not send your last reply as a PM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
For the record…</p>
<p>Do I believe it’s a scam? No.</p>
<p>Do I <em>recommend</em> using/trying the service? No.</p>
<p>Do I believe there’s a risk to trying the service? No.</p>
<p>Do I think that RocketYou is making several potentially catastrophic missteps? Yes.</p>
<p>(Fwiw, I’ve helped launch large platform betas. So I understand that it’s not easy building market confidence in a brand new offering, especially one that challenges the dominant model.)</p>

            <p>At this point I’m wondering if you work for RocketYou. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Which is why I substantiated my deduction that it is lacks credibility with other evidence besides its reviews (or lack thereof).</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a full time professional in the music industry to understand and recognize a good business model. And this isn’t one. It fails on perhaps the most crucial step, which is selling the idea. The fact that it even looks like a scam should be a red flag.</p>

<p>Missing the point again. I’m not saying OP’s question is irrelevant. What I <em>am</em> saying is less relevant is your need to hash out the exact details of RocketYou’s offer. From what I can see, the people on this thread understand it well enough to make an informed decision without getting hindered by unnecessary details.</p>

<p>If you want to get technical about it:<br>
<em>scam: noun - informal: a dishonest scheme; a fraud.</em><br>
Since you don’t have any more experience with RocketYou than anybody else here, it might be beneficial to leave the debating about what exactly the dictionary definition of what a scam is for another time. It’s besides the point, and any of the definitions raised in this thread will suffice.</p>

<p>:sigh: OK…</p>

<p>I’m sure you don’t know enough about how “real, well known promotional agencies” handle sales and marketing to make that kind of generalisation.</p>
<p>Fwiw, I work within marketing and I know enough not to make generalisations like that.</p>
<p>It’s highly likely that companies offering music services, such as promoters and even label A&amp;Rs, are hanging out where music makers hang out. Discord servers are increasingly part of that landscape.</p>
<p>Similarly, it’s likely that an increasing number of meaningful transactions start out as DMs on obscure music communities.</p>
<p>Years ago we’d question the legitimacy and reputation of companies who used Twitter to handle customer support requests. But, it’s pretty common now. Go figure.</p>

<p>It’s lucky you’re here to remind the OP that their question isn’t important (or relevant).</p>
<p>It’s fine if you want to rail against bot offers etc… (I’m no fan either), but at least attempt to properly address the OP’s question first (and know the difference), rather than attempting to second-guess their ‘actual’ question. What you refer to as the “real point” simply appears to be the point <em>you</em> feel should be discussed.</p>
<p>It’s related, but it’s not the OP’s question. So, first things first maybe.</p>

<p>I’m sure you know that real, well known promotional agencies don’t DM people on discord in a bot-like fashion offering up their “services”. <strong>The exact, specific offer that RocketYou proposes isn’t important.</strong> Putting aside the fact that other peoples’ definition of a scam doesn’t exactly match your definition word for word, having done some looking into the company I can say that it looks fishy at the very least.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Stick to well known promotional agencies and distribution platforms, and self promotion, but avoid newer methods such as RocketYou and others, atleast until they build more of a reputation.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know how it’s possible to accurately and reasonably address ‘the real point’ without…</p>
<ol>
<li>First knowing what constitutes a scam.</li>
<li>Having the ability to discern between this offer and other offers</li>
</ol>
<p>Better to leave this question to people who are willing to look a bit deeper and/or who have more knowledge on the subject. Certainly better than spouting uninformed opinion as though it were fact (as some have done here) and making potentially libellous statements with no foundation. That doesn’t help anyone.</p>
<p>But, hey, that’s just my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Given the rest of your response, I think you’re amongst those who haven’t properly grasped what RocketYou is offering either. (I’m not saying that it’s a good offer, but it’s worth having a decent understanding of what the offer actually is, if you’re going to pass judgement on it and advise others about it.)</p>
<p>They’re not selling batches of empty plays, so directly comparing it to ‘promo channels’ offering X plays/like/reposts for $10 isn’t as helpful as you might think.</p>
<p>If you believe I’ve misunderstood RocketYou’s offer, then I’m happy for you to correct me and point out how.</p>
<p>I’d also appreciate those who are convinced it’s a scam explaining to me how the scam supposedly works - keeping in mind that the offering is <span class="bbcode-u">free</span> to artists.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/helixx">@HELIXX</a> Regardless of the legitimacy of this offer, plays in mass quantity rarely if ever help your publicity or help you expand. In fact, they can often hurt your profile, as the plays are mainly from “listeners” that will not be repeat listeners / don’t actually care about your music that much. Not to mention that a track with a ton of plays but almost no comments / feedback or real interaction looks odd to an outsider.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s best to ignore these types of offers, as while this may be legitimate at least in some respects, other offers are not and will try to scam you or require payment. Real, interested listeners are the best and the only reliable way to improve upon your musical persona.</p>
