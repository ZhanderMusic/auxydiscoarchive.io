**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: -

            <p>Ok, so here‚Äôs the winner:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/EVERANGE">@EVERANGE</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, your submission keeps the energy high without using any ‚Äúannoying‚Äù sounds you would normally hear from royalty free music. The sub goes well with the rhythm and used melodically instead of continuously.</p>
<hr>
<p>Honourable mentions:<br>
Vepium - Byzentine<br>
A joyful submission, only losing by a bit for the lead choice. Overall a great submission nonetheless, drum solo to mix things up made it hard for me to decide whether you should be the winner or Just Chill‚Äôs submission.</p>
<p>Kamal - Rap Beat 6<br>
Easily a banger with sub heavy bass and traditional beats that go well with the genre you‚Äôre accomplishing, but docking points for the repetition of the overall song. Great beat, easily going to get people dancing.</p>
