    <title>Time - By ChiefBC</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/time-by-chiefbc/4022</link>
    <description>So, I made a track, and I’d like the community to listen to it. Honestly, I’m not sure what genre I’d identify this as, but some feedback and constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated!

            <p>Agreed. Once it gets going around half way through the song it’s very nice listening, it just felt like it took a while to get there. and then ended too soon.</p>
<p>To me it still felt like it was building to something at the end of the song; I was pretty much waiting for some mad drums and a banging bassline to be dropped in <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>All of that said I still like the song as it is, so liked and you now have a new follower on SC. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I like it, the off beat piano caught me by surprise but not in a bad way. I listened twice and I really like the sound you brought in at about :55. From that point to the end i like what you’ve done, kinda just wish it was longer but as is you’ve got a nice little track going on <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
