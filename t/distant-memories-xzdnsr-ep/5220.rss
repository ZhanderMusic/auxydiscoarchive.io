_Distant Memories_ is a project I worked one during late summer nights in 2017. Consisting of 4 official tracks, this EP was originally supposed to have more, but I decided not to add them since I didn&#39;t quite like them. The tracks you hear in this EP are the ones I liked the best.

What do you think? What&#39;s your favorite track? Leave any comments here and enjoy the music!</description>

            <p>I really like how all the songs are peaceful. Hopes is a little repetitive, but overall It’s a great EP. Well done!</p>
