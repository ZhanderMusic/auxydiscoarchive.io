    <title>Crystalize - XN (WIP) (Chill) [Feedback] [Garageband]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/crystalize-xn-wip-chill-feedback-garageband/7898</link>
    <description>Something a bit different from what i normally produce... 
I started this track the other day in Garageband, only been about 2 days into it, but it&#39;s a finished rough draft.
Figured i would share it and get some feedback
I&#39;m not the happiest with the second half of the track (especially that buildup) because i didnt think it fit in super well with the more &quot;chill&quot; kinda [Direct](https://soundcloud.com/directmusic) vibe i was going for, so if anyone can help with that, it would be appreciated.

(it&#39;s also a bit quiet so you might need to put up your volume to hear)

            <p>Haha yeah I’m terrible at chords. In most of my tracks, i actually make the raps, bass n everything else first. Chords are like last. This was prob the first time that I’ve started out with chords and it’s only 4 repeating chords lol.</p>
<p>And I was using Desktop GB.<br>
Thanks for the feedback.</p>

            <p>I like the shuffling drums. I was realllly hoping for the piano part to use a lower pitched chord after the first two that plays throughout the song but it never happened <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>iOS GarageBand? Or Mac? I like when I hear stuff that I can’t discern as a certain platform and you’ve achieved that here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
