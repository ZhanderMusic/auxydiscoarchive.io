    <title>Auxy with external synth?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-with-external-synth/9158</link>
    <description>Anyone use Auxy with an external synth?
I’m still pretty new to this, but basically, I would like to use Auxy as a sequencer, and then tweak or change the sounds, more than you can with the included automation. Has anyone done this?</description>

            <p>This would be awesome. But probably pretty useless as you would sequence in the DAW you are already using.</p>
<p>What would be amazing is if some auxy synths were released to be used.</p>

            <p>Yup, or as a melodic instrument like all the others, but providing functionality. Kind of how like in Reason you have a rack item for midi output and that’s literally all it does (or a midi channel/instrument like in many many other DAW applications)</p>

<p>Indeed. It’s a great candidate for one of those power features that could put Auxy in a different league to where it is now.</p>
<p>(I still have the old Auxy app on my iPad, so I might give it a go.)</p>
<p>It could be layered in the UI, so not presented in the first layer (where the majority) or users likely dwell, but available and configurable through secondary menus, for power users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
To quote the CDM article… <em>“Auxy is an island no more.”</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the biggest challenge to this happening (again) is Auxy’s preferred ‘walled garden’ vision.</p>

            <p>See this would be an insane feature to bring back, especially if it would route core midi to other apps. The built in sounds are great, but being able to drive multiple apps at the same time? Whammo!</p>

<p>Auxy was already the nicest melodic editor on iPad. But it was simple to a fault. Now it adds MIDI export and MIDI output - and becomes a must-have.</p>

            <p>If any of you still have the original Auxy Creator Studio app, which they took off the app store unfortunately, that features external MIDI support. It seems as if it was dropped from the newer versions because it wasn’t used enough by people when it was there. Then again, most people probably didn’t even know it was a feature. I don’t really know how well it works, either.</p>

            <p>Nice.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of Volcas and a Minilogue, plus a bunch of good pedals (and a couple of midi keyboard controllers)… though I rarely use any of them, but plan to, at some point.</p>
<p>When I get into using the hardware, I plan to scoop up a few Moog bits, likely a Mother 32, Minitaur and maybe a Subsequent 37 as a real treat.</p>

            <p>I’ve got an OB-6, it’s a collaboration machine between Dave Smith and Tom Oberheim. 6 oscillator, rich sound, and it’s fun to play around with. I’m having technical difficulties with my external audio interface right now though, so I’m unable to record off of it into my daw at the moment… but I’m working on it. I’ll be using it in my tracks when I get the recording working.</p>

            <p>Mobile is becoming increasingly credible as a music production environment, so it would make sense for Auxy to enter that space – <em>a breeze on the surface but very deep when/if you need it</em> – before someone else does, pushing Auxy even further down the chart.</p>
<p>Some power options could really expand the appeal and extend the shelf-life amongst developing musicians (while offering some stiffer competition to certain other mobile apps).</p>

            <p>There’s no hardware that has the same workflow as Auxy that I know of. Maybe a <a href="https://global.novationmusic.com/circuit/circuit#">Novation Circuit</a> but I think you might end up feeling limited by two synth parts and I think 8 drum parts? This thing is ONLY visual though, no screen lol. I would imagine there’s a bit of a learning curve.</p>
<p>Desktop software can and will do what you’re looking to do but you mentioned you already use Logic so you know that already <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I honestly don’t know of any other software that is as clear and speedy as Auxy but at the level you’re looking for… I suspect there’s a market for such a thing (a breeze on the surface but very deep when/if you need it)</p>

            <p>I’ve pushed out mixed stems and MIDI before, but only really used exported MIDI on a single (older) sketch piece.<br>
It ended up as a mixture of Auxy stems, beat stems from the DM1 app, an arp stem from Fugue Machine app and a lead line using sounds via Ableton Live, based on MIDI exported from Auxy.</p>
<p>Not live, just brought together in Ableton.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I do that with Logic, but I want to be able to adjust the sound live. I want to tweak the sound while I’m tweaking the sequencing.<br>

            <p>I do that all the time.<br>
It’s the main reason I use Auxy.</p>

            <p>I mean you could write a tune in Auxy and export a midi file and run it though your DAW of choice to control your synth, but live Auxy to external synth is sadly not possible at the moment.</p>

            <p>Wow. What a bummer. So if I want to use external synths, I will need to learn how to use a completely new sequencer?<br>
I really love how visual Auxy is, I don’t know how people use sequencers with no visual feedback. Any suggestions on hardware sequencers that would be closest to Auxy?</p>

            <p>That’s a negatory. Auxy doesn’t currently support Audiobus, AUv3, midi out to other apps etc.</p>
<p>Some sort of native synth would be great.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I have done that in Logic. But I would like something to adjust the sounds while I’m using it, instead of after.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure, although I do think there is an option to export a sample file created on auxy into ableton or FL (or any other software you use)</p>
<p>I’m guessing you should first render the project and go to the export box and there might be an option to export it as a file or sample…</p>

            <p>Anyone use Auxy with an external synth?<br>
I’m still pretty new to this, but basically, I would like to use Auxy as a sequencer, and then tweak or change the sounds, more than you can with the included automation. Has anyone done this?</p>
