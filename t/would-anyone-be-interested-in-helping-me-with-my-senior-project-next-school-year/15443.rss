    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/would-anyone-be-interested-in-helping-me-with-my-senior-project-next-school-year/15443</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for assistance in the form of a member of The community who has experience in production on multiple platforms and is educated on software, hardware, and other tech and technique, to be my ‚Äòmentor‚Äô for me to consult at least once a semester to talk about stuff to do with the project. I plan on creating a concept album that will force me to push my boundaries as a producer with Auxy and other means of production. If anyone is interested just Respond to this post and/or DM me on discord at Jacob#2744</description>

            <p>Inn thinking of using you guys as general references and help and probably going to do a deeper search for the mentor figure. As for the projects, it‚Äôs  going to be a mix of Auxy and FL, I want to learn how to apply effects and mix the Auxy projects in FL but also make use of FL‚Äôs production capabilities in full in a few tracks, which means I kinda have to hit Thebes grind on learning the DAW (I should probably get a legit copy pretty soon too considering the cracked one I have glitches <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"> im  poor lol)</p>

<p>How will you know if people are qualified enough? It‚Äôs your senior project, so you should really put some research into who you are choosing. I‚Äôd advise choosing someone with professional experience (not just Auxy).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm no professional, but I‚Äôm an experienced FL user and I‚Äôd like to say I know what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm qualified to be a mentor just yet, but DM me if you have any questions, I‚Äôll do my best to answer them!</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm looking for assistance in the form of a member of The community who has experience in production on multiple platforms and is educated on software, hardware, and other tech and technique, to be my ‚Äòmentor‚Äô for me to consult at least once a semester to talk about stuff to do with the project. I plan on creating a concept album that will force me to push my boundaries as a producer with Auxy and other means of production. If anyone is interested just Respond to this post and/or DM me on discord at Jacob#2744</p>
