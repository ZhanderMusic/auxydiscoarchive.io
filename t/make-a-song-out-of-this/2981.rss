    <title>Make a song out of this!</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/make-a-song-out-of-this/2981</link>
    <description>A bit of a while ago, I was on Auxy, and at the same time I was on my piano keyboard, when suddenly this beat popped into mind.

I couldn’t come up with anything to add, so I decided to not let it go to waste and see what you guys can come up with!
