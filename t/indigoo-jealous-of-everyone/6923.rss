    <title>Indigoo - Jealous of Everyone</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/indigoo-jealous-of-everyone/6923</link>
    <description>So yesterday I posted a track called “Jealous of Everyone” and I thought that you guys would like it and could could give some feedback on it. It’s my first track with Auxy 5, and I’m really happy how it turned out.
