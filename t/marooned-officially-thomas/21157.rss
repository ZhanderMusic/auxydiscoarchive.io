    <title>Marooned - Officially Thomas</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/marooned-officially-thomas/21157</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have returned. Is this place still active? 

If it is, then check out my two new songs. 

“Marooned” and “Love Each Other (Interlude).”

“Marooned” is the entertainment and “Love Each Other” is the encouragement.

 Here is the link to both songs: https://linktr.ee/officially_thomas 

Enjoy and have a great day 😁</description>
