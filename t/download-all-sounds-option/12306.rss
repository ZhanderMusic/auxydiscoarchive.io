    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/download-all-sounds-option/12306</link>
    <description>If I could download all the sounds and samples at the click of a button this would be perfect. Another very important thing is being able to make use of all those sounds when in airplane mode - I do a lot of composing when I am travelling!</description>

            <p>These numbers don’t surprise at all - I remember going from the iPhone 4 to the 5 and the speed difference was incredibly noticeable. At the time I was playing a lot of XCOM on iOS, and the load times were unbearable. On the 5, twice as fast. Then the 6, same thing, everything just so much faster.</p>
<p>Frankly, if I had thought to just go and get my iPhone 6 serviced for battery replacement, I woulda done that instead of buying the SE. This thing is terrible lol. Typo city! The iPhone 6 definitely was fast enough for what I wanted to do on it.</p>
<p>From 6 to 7 to 8 I just don’t think the speed increases feel as significant. These are powerful devices. I’m getting OT a bit. But anyhoo - yes, download whole pack +1 <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I suspect relatively few Auxy users are using a current iPhone, so YMMV.</p>

            <p>First of all, thanks for replying! Always good to see how active you are following discussions here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Regarding the size of the library, the mid-tier memory for an iPhone today is 256GB so I think most will be ok. But I think your suggestion of a “download this pack” option would be great - as long as it will also be available in airplane mode as well! Cheers and thanks for a great app (I come from Reason (since ca. 2002) and don’t open it nearly as often now…).</p>

            <p>Indeed! Although with a team of two, the roles are obviously less formal. So Fredrik is also a bit of a product owner, although I’m not doing any coding.</p>
<p>We also have a super special guy hiding somewhere that we sometimes bring in to help with really complicated sound stuff. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s mostly Fredrik who’s responsible for the updates, I believe.</p>

</aside>
<p>They’re not acting independently of each other.<br>
Lenberg is the Product Owner/Manager, from what I understand of how roles are broken down between the two.<br>
As such, he’ll be the person users need to convince.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/goxenar">@Goxenar</a> Referring to Lenberg as ‘Auxy developer’ is tricky. As I understand it, Auxy was co-founded by them both, with both possibly still being co-owners.</p>
<p>‘Developer’ is a tricky title to use for Lenberg given that the other member of the team is the actual (only full-time) developer, while, as mentioned above, Lenberg seemingly serves at Product Manager/Product Owner.<br>
(‘Product Owner’ is an organisational title referring to the person chiefly responsible for a product’s growth, etc…, rather than meaning the actual ‘owner’ of the product.<br>
In this case, he is also co-owner of the company that created and produces the Auxy app.)</p>

            <p>Thanks for input! This has been discussed before and duly noted. I see where you’re coming from. Just think about this though, as the sound library grows, this makes less and less sense. Hopefully, we should be able to scale the library to a size that makes it completely unfeasible to download all sounds. But perhaps a quick “download this pack” makes more sense.</p>

            <p>This is a great idea, i could benefit from it (at least for the melodic sounds; the samples are a bit massive in number. As for offline, when you have the subscription, Sounds you downloaded should stay on your phone even in airplane mode for one week, as long as the battery doesn’t die and you don’t restart your phone.</p>

            <p>If I could download all the sounds and samples at the click of a button this would be perfect. Another very important thing is being able to make use of all those sounds when in airplane mode - I do a lot of composing when I am travelling!</p>
