    <title>How to import Auxy drum samples from Auxy to Logic pro x</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-to-import-auxy-drum-samples-from-auxy-to-logic-pro-x/13799</link>
    <description>As the title says i would like to know what can i do to import Auxy drum samples from Auxy to Logic Pro X.
I know that i can render every instrument as a track and put one drum sample on every drum instrument. But that would just take too much time.
Do you guys know of a way to do this that is faster?</description>

            <p>I don‚Äôt know if anyone has mentioned it, but you can fill up a drum kit, and program the samples seperated so they don‚Äôt overlap. Export uncompressed audio and share with airdrop. Slice the audio file and bounce the samples to new wav files.</p>

            <p>If that comes to the next Auxy update that will be amazing. It will make things whole lot more easier!<br>
Thanks for all the information i will check the sample pack out. If its affordable ill buy it :).</p>
<p>By the way you talked about EQing Logic. It came to my mind are there any plans for Built in EQ for Auxy?</p>

            <p>Thanks ICS for pointing me towards this thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://blackoctopus-sound.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blackoctopus-sound.com/</a> is where you can find most of the licensed sound currently included in Auxy. In addition, Crate Diggers and Cutting Edge Percussion are licensed from <a href="https://originsound.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://originsound.co.uk/</a>. As for the default Auxy samples, you‚Äôd need to do some work to export samples individually in order to achieve the desired result, but as opposed to 3000 samples (Leviathan 2) there‚Äôs only around 120 native to Auxy.</p>
<p>Also, according to Lenberg, there may be more robust exporting features coming soon for Auxy, and hopefully one of these is individual sample exports from drum kits. This will make a huge step in helping towards importing Auxy samples into Logic, as when they are exported individually it allows for better EQing of the samples.</p>

            <p>It says the samples are allowed to use non transferably. So does that mean i cant use the samples out of Auxy?<br>
(My english is not thay good so im having a hard time trying to understand the terms lol sorry)</p>

            <p>i dont see why they wouldn‚Äôt be legal. I can still upload my tracks with the old auxy sounds that I dont have anymore and exporting to other DAW‚Äôs is a built in feature of the app too, so i dont see why that would be illegal too.</p>
<p>As long as you‚Äôre not selling the individual sounds as your own you should be fine</p>

            <p>It doesn‚Äôt, but you‚Äôre recording just the audio from it. So you could record hits direct into ES24 or just cut loops from the output of Auxy. Either would save a little time!</p>

            <p>I would connect your iOS device to your Mac and just record everything directly via IDAM.</p>
<p><small>This is more-or-less how I use Auxy 99% of the time.</small></p>

            <p>You‚Äôre in for a real long haul. You could export individual hits, cut them up and assign to whatever sampler Logic uses (ES24?) - this is going to be incredibly time consuming.</p>
<p>Your best bet would be to just do the work you want in Auxy and dump stems to Logic. From there you could do any layering / post processing you want/need.</p>
<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, if there‚Äôs a specific sample pack you really like it might be worthwhile to just get it from the source - a healthy chunk of the samples in Auxy are sourced from third party sample packs you can purchase. <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/therealjfalc">@TheRealJFalc</a> knows a bit more about it and has linked some of those exact packs here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>nope.</p>
<p>well you could do each sample and stretch the scene to 8 bars and just put each hit every bar or so (if that makes sense)</p>

            <p>As the title says i would like to know what can i do to import Auxy drum samples from Auxy to Logic Pro X.<br>
I know that i can render every instrument as a track and put one drum sample on every drum instrument. But that would just take too much time.<br>
Do you guys know of a way to do this that is faster?</p>
