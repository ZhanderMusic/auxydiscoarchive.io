    <description>Ok guys so i am going to drop an album i put all of the songs to the amuse and the cover art.At first On my cover art at the bottom it said THE ALBUM.But after a while they sent me an email that said that i shouldnt use more text than than the title and artist name.And i sent it again without THE ALBUM text here it is![image|500x500](upload://lq6ZnSJaUblL6er1nQH7S7fH9cq.jpg)
BTW UNDER THE DEEP THOUGHTS TEXT i have my logo in crimson red(The braille alphabet one)But its not in this photo cause the other one is in my comp...
And they sent me an email AGAIN saying it shouldnt have more text than the title and the artist name.Well there isnt any text more than Deep thoughts and my braille logo. By the way it says the spelling should be correct.I think it is correct.I really need help what do you guys think the problem is?!</description>

            <p>I uploaded like 30-something tracks on 2 separate releases, had to take them down to edit/fix transcoding issues, then when I tried to re-upload they (Amuse) rejected the artwork they’d literally already approved. Tried to ask/explain and got spammed by an automated customer service thing with a mess of chat-boxes like “great…”</p>
<p>On a separate release the art was hand-drawn &amp; shaded in pencil by a very talented artist in my city, scanned it &amp; re-sized to their rules but still rejected because they said it didn’t meet their “newer, stricter guidelines” for art… If I’d never taken anything down for changes it would all still be there, making a lot of time spent for nothing on their platform. Talking to them is pointless because they’re very ok with letting an automated flag tool dictate everything like a robot that doesn’t care.</p>

            <p>I agree.</p>
<p>CD Baby is great if you’re not happy with Amuse.<br>
They have a TON of great, helpful tips and articles for the indie musician.<br>
I used them to release my my LP.</p>

<p>Tbh, if they’re setting stylistic conditions like that about your artwork, I’d keep the artwork and swap Amuse.<br>
It’s one thing to say that you ‘need’ the title and name, but when they’re replying with template statements rather than meaningful, helpful info, it’s not a promising sign.</p>
<p>It may seem a small thing, but it’s <em>your</em> brand. Don’t sacrifice it on Day 1.</p>
