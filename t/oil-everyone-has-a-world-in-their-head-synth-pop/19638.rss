            <p>I’m doing a Sound Tech course at university, and the current state of my tracks are already better than they were before I started. It’s really nice to know I’m making progress! Thanks, homes &lt;3</p>

<p>I think the seeds of quality are already there.<br>
I’d certainly enjoy hearing more tracks like this one taken to the next level in terms of production finish. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>

Some stuff I need to get together first. I generally have no idea how to categorize most of my songs, hence the lack of genre tags, but I’ll run my music by more people in future so I can tag them appropriately.</p>

            <p>Cool. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
I think your track has a similar lo-fi pop sound.</p>
<p>Btw, I’d also consider having a stab at ‘proper’ artwork, something that might be more fitting.<br>
Or maybe it’s just a case of sticking your logo over the images. That way, they look intentionally quirky, because that’s part of your ‘brand identity’, rather than possibly just a random image.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
<p>Oh, and get some genre tags on there. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I <em>love</em> Men I Trust, so that’s a huge compliment! Thanks for telling me. I’ve been working on giving my future tracks more variety and movement, so it helps to know that I’m headed in the right direction.</p>

            <p>I like it. Simple alt-pop/dream-pop vibe to it.<br>
Reminded me a little of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MenITrust" rel="nofollow noopener">Men I Trust</a>.</p>
<p>Would work well with a vocal, imo.<br>
Check out Men I Trust, as that might give you some ideas about possible vocal directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
One criticism… The background riff/solo that kinda steps up a gear around 1:40… feels like goes on too long - 32 bars (over a minute, I think). I’d either develop some variety and movement into it, or shorten it (the number of bars with instrument/riff, not shorten the track).</p>
