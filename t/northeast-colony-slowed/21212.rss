    <title>Northeast - Colony (slowed)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/northeast-colony-slowed/21212</link>
    <description>I was tinkering around a bit and I lowered the pitch on Colony, one of the songs I made a while back, and I liked the way it sounded. Then I decided to slow it down and add a bit more reverb to it, and one thing led to another, here we are!

Unfortunately now I don’t have the original Colony project, so the only reference I can give y’all is the one I posted on SC:
