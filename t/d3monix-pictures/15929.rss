    <title>D3monix - Pictures</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/d3monix-pictures/15929</link>
    <description>Hey guys I made a song for my cousin who passed last year after looking back over the pictures of us hanging out. 
He inspired me to make music from a really young age and this is how I would like to repay him! 
To all who listen, I hope you all find enjoyment out of this song, and remember to cherish the time you have with people because you never know what could happen. https://soundcloud.com/demonixlive/pictures-1/s-faPb1</description>
