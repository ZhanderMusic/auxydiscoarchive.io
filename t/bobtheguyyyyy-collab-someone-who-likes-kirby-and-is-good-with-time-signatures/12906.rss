    <description>I’m looking to do a remix of a really good song... but since it’s time signatures are really weird I’d like someone with a clear knowledge of that to help me. The song is:

https://soundcloud.com/applepiemonstrosity/marxs-theme

https://soundcloud.com/kari_the_conqueror/galactic-ambition-theme-of-marx-kirby-star-allies
