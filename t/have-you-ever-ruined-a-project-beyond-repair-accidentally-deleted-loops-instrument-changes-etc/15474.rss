            <p>When I was first making <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stereofld/fade" rel="nofollow noopener">Fade</a>, I deleted the main drum rack by accident. Meant to delete one of the loops. I had to remake it, but it turned out better than the first time, so I’m not complaining <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Only when I got an entirely new iPhone. All of my projects got deleted so I had to start all projects entirely from scratch.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was pretty bummed about that. But I’m a lot better than I was now, so it’s okay I guess</p>
<p>Looking back on it those projects were actually pretty bad <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>I’ve accidentally deleted 3 songs while trying to delete finished/unused projects. I never recreated 2 of them because I couldn’t remember how I created automations and couldn’t exactly remember what instruments where in the track.<br>
One of the lost tracks that I still had a render of:<br>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/plhector/7am" rel="nofollow noopener">07:00</a></p>
<p>The 3rd track was successfully recreated so I’m pretty happy about that. It’s one of my favorite tracks I’ve worked on so far.</p>

            <p>One time an entire project disappeared overnight. That was fun, it was replaced by an older version. This was back in the 4 day’s though so no biggie xD but I suppose I ruined many of my songs beyond repair at times. Most of these songs don’t make it in the end though … although there was that one time I screwed up the drums so hard while making SFH with <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Peregrihn">@Peregrihn</a> that we had to start over practically with the drums xD</p>

            <p>ayyy hopefully not a lot of progress! has happened to me too though usually when coming up with major drum patterns so when stuff gets really good sometimes I’ll get out the app and re-enter so it could hopefully auto save up to that good point</p>

            <p>Yes this happened to me at least 4 times, those four projects were definitely mourned.</p>

            <p>Nothing “beyond repair” as in I wouldn’t theoretically be able to restore it, but I have goofed up a few times due to accidental touches / swipes in the app resulting in some headaches, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting note(s) / automation nodes while trying to scroll</li>
<li>Accidentally moving loops to other instruments resulting in them being deselected everywhere in the track</li>
<li>Deselecting note / automation loops and not noticing until rendering or, in rare cases, after the song is released</li>
<li>Pre Auxy 5, switching scene order while trying to scroll through the timeline</li>
</ul>

            <p>No but I’ve had times were I’m making a fire beat! Then the app closes for no reason <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>
<p>Then it deletes my progress sometimes</p>

            <p>i’ve had some of those goofs for sure, but so far nothing unrepairable, but still, having an undo button would be pretty noice</p>
