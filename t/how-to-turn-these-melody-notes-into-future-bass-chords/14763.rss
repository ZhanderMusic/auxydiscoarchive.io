So I came up with a great melody including the chords in my head, but I’m not exactly sure how to make these chords sound “chill”. Any insight as to how to to make these single notes into chords?</description>

            <p>When you switch a melody from scale view to chromatic mode, it doesn’t change the melody. In scale view, you see all the notes in the scale for the key you are in, when you switch to chromatic mode, you see all the notes on the whole piano roll. The scale view was made so people could stay in key, so it’s missing a few notes, when it switches to chromatic mode, it adds the notes missing to the piano roll. Don’t know if this is what you meant, but I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>Made two progressions, kinda similar. Tried to make an example of how you could use them, not the best but hopefully it will give you some inspiration. If you’re not happy with it or if it wasn’t what you were looking for, I would be happy to make another one! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smiley.png?v=7" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>P.s. No need to credit me!</p>

            <p>I’ll need more than just hearing, since my hiatus with Auxy set me back pretty far. YouTube gives some good ones, but I can’t work with chromatic, since I find it too complicated and only know major scales (Though this future core attempt is in Ab Major, I can’t use the 7th, 9th and 11th chords properly in scale view). I usually like to look at projects themselves to look into the chords and use those for inspiration for my own songs. Thanks though!</p>

            <p>Take your time, but I got a song planned for this one. Never successfully made a future core song, but this one is starting to scratch the surface. I just need some example of how to future bass-erize this.</p>
