    <title>Final Fight - XN [Drum n&#39; Bass]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/final-fight-xn-drum-n-bass/8809</link>

First finished track with the &quot;new Auxy&quot; (i put that in quotes because i&#39;m a free user so, its more of a downgrade really [spoiler]kek[/spoiler])
It was a challenge to get some good sounding drums, but i can get creative (pitched toms &amp; claps ftw)

Idk how i made this really. I just thought of the drop bass line and was like &quot;Yoooo i got an idea&quot; and just kept working with it to eventually get here:

Also i was listening to some Obsidia and got some inspiration from there too. 

enjoy.
