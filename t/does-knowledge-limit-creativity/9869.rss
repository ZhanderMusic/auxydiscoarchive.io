    <title>Does knowledge limit creativity?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/does-knowledge-limit-creativity/9869</link>
    <description>So, when I was first starting with Auxy, I had no knowledge about music or how to make it. I built tracks through experimentation, and although it wasn&#39;t always great, it was _my_ sound. It was unique and charming, and I loved it.

At some point, I started learning things. Things about chords, music theory stuff, and how to make certain genres I enjoyed. I was thankful for the guidelines and the help. My music skyrocketed to another level of quality, and I was always proud of it.

But something happened. Although it was better music, it wasn&#39;t _my_ music. It was good music, something you could dance to, but nothing about it sounded like the style I had made. It just seemed to lack **creativity**. It became harder and harder to make unique sounding chords, and I somehow forgot how I used to make them. 

I was eventually able to overcome this and now try to blend my knowledge and creativity together, leading me to finally decide knowledge both limits and enhances creativity. It has its ups and downs. Although my stuff did lose some of the originality it once had, whenever I am able to blend my knowledge and creativity, the result is of a higher quality. However, there was a long period of time when I thought it only limited it, so I was wondering about all of your thoughts. ;P</description>

            <p>I can really relate to this since i’m a percussionist. In my opinion, music theory is disgusting and I hate it but I can still make decent music without that much knowledge about it. All I know about music theory is that 7th chords are nice and that ending a phrase in a tritone will get you killed in all 50 states. (seriously dont use tritones)</p>

            <p>As someone who started making music on Auxy with no idea of music theory and developed over time, this really resonates with me.</p>
<p>I really started putting the most work into my beats at first, but then came the melodies and I’m at the stage where my own music is rising in quality. I hope. A thing I do to try and keep my music un-stale as possible is to give things time and maybe even by going out and learning something new. This happened recently when I became dissatisfied as to how I was structuring my drums, and so I’ve been taking a break where I use my electric kit more, and I’ve gotta say I’m really liking the beats that I’ve been making on it where before I felt that all the beats I made on it felt similar.</p>
<p>So maybe just try and take a look at it in another way (which is easier said than done) but really, playing around with stuff until something clicks is an alright approach.</p>

            <p>but in all reality i do think that you kind of have a point but</p>
<p>if your so called “knowledge” results in something thats not yours, that just sounds like other peoples music is it really knowledge? or is it just knowing how to copy popular music? (im not accusing you of anything btw i like your music im just saying in general) i would say that true “knowledge” would be the knowledge that allows you to make something original, the knowledge to create your own unique style</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m inclined to disagree with the notion that creativity is somehow an intuitive act that happens once the thinking has been done.<br>
Or that thinking is for craft and creativity is for the art.</p>
<p>Thinking is a creative act, as much to do with the ‘what’ as the ‘how’.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to get bogged down in over-thinking something, but that’s something you can work through as you become more familiar with your own work and your own way of working - and learn to trust yourself and not to fear failure.</p>
<p>Imo, it has very little to do with compartmentalising thinking and creating as separate parts of the process.</p>
<p>(I’m probably gonna step back out of this thread, before I get drawn in too deeply. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Yeah I dunno. Aphex Twin is known for being totally full of it sometimes (a lot?) but I recall either reading or hearing while writing at one point he spent no time listening to anything (which would suggest that you’re only building on what you know and have heard up to that point, and continue to discover on your own).</p>
<p>I think with anything, knowledge is needed to help the creative mind know how to do something, but at a certain point it can be overthunk and then that’s going to stifle creativity big time.</p>
<p>So there’s gotta be a balance for sure - you can’t just fling notes around really without some kind of structure, but you can’t be so rigid that you don’t break out of the box.</p>
<p>Much philosophical, very wow lol</p>

<p>Hmmmm. Ever thought that Art might simply be an expression of knowledge, but in another form?<br>
(What you’re suggesting implies that good Art is made in isolation from knowledge. [I’m not referring to knowledge about craft.])</p>
<p>(It’s closely related to the topic of the PhD that I still might do.<br>

            <p>It’s not really knowledge imo. It’s comfortability. As we produce more and more, we start to find certain aspects of tracks that we like: Bpm, genre, key, instruments etc. That’s the idea of where one’s “sound” comes from; the similarities that make your music <strong>your</strong> music.</p>
<p>We get better at one style of track and tha’s also where the limitation idea comes in. The more you make, the more you feel like your limiting your possibilities.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is a great question. It applies to things outside of music as well, but here’s my two pence:</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for about 19 years now. That’s older than some of you here, which is terrifying to me. When I first started, I was in the same boat. I didn’t know what a chord was, a melody, or whatever. Over time you pick these things up, maybe you were lucky and your parents made you play an instrument (I wish mine did!), or you ventured out and learned one and could apply those things to producing electronic based music.</p>
<p>As time goes on, you hone your craft, you learn more, and you get better. Better is always going to be subjective to the listener, but you can tell when you listen to the music of someone who has a mastery of the tool set vs someone just starting out.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub - as you gain this knowledge, I think you start to hold yourself to sometimes impossible standards. Before you even try something you might discard it because “technically” it won’t work or it doesn’t make sense. This is where things get difficult with knowledge and art.</p>
<p>Knowledge and art don’t necessarily go hand in hand. I think there are tethers of a link between them but I don’t think knowledge GUIDING art is the best case scenario.</p>
<p>I’m getting a little rambly? I can’t tell, my screen is so small lol.</p>
<p>Anyway, I agree that in order to “think outside the box” you’ve got to be willing to abandon the safety net of what you know and try something different. I’m not even saying try a different genre or whatever, just to get from point A to point B in a different manner. Usually you start with chords? Try drums first. Or vice versa.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Knowledge guiding art isn’t the best.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would say pure fear of doing something wrong limits creativity more than anything else you could think of.  It’s always fear at the root of these things. Be fearless with your music.  That might mean not being afraid to use the tried and true chords, etc.  If you’re really good at that and the stuff sounds great and makes you proud who cares? Or it might mean not being afraid to incorporate more advanced/weird/complicated stuff into your tunes if you feel the need.</p>
<p>See what I mean? Don’t box yourself in. Don’t be afraid. And for chrissake don’t torture yourself over your art.  That’s the worst thing you can do.  Leave that for the folks who whine all day about searching for “inspiration” and then never get jack done.  Don’t be one of those people. Put your ass in the chair, get to work, and HAVE FUN</p>

            <p>I kind of have the same problem. One of these tracks is a newer one, one is much older. While (at least in my opinion) they both sound good, they are very different styles.<br>

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/indigooo/plasma-palace-zone-2017" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/indigooo/plasma-palace-zone-2017</a><br>
Also, I agree with you on coming up with different chords. I’ve been using similar 7th chords for my recent tracks.</p>

            <p>Maybe knowledge about music theory can inprove your skills in making a song more professional with sounds that are more pleasing to listen to, but I think that you sometimes just got to let go of the things that you already know, and experiment with other stuff.</p>
<p>Knowledge can be boring. It’s the new and experimental stuff that makes a song unique and fresh every time you listen to it.</p>
<p>So in my opninion: yes, sometimes knowledge can limit creativity, but it doesn’t have to be that way if you create some space for new and fresh things that just sound good, no matter how weird it is on paper.</p>

            <p>That’s because, in the late '80s, we’d been repeatedly told that there’s no no, no-n no-no, no-n no no no no, there’s no li–mit.</p>
