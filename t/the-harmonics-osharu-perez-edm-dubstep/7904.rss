            <p>Yeah, I’m still in school, (though that’s not an excuse), so I don’t really have time to search or make a real professional cover art. I made that album when I was first transitioning from doing music as a hobby to producing music as a more serious hobby. (If that even makes sense)</p>

            <p>If it’s exactly what you were aiming for, that’s fine. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Just wasn’t sure if it was intentional.</p>
<p>(Fwiw, the teenage thing isn’t an ‘excuse’. I’ve seen and worked with some incredibly talented teenage illustrators and designers. Keep in mind that ‘design’ Ian about addressing a need. If it’s just about self-expression, then it’s not truly ‘design’.)</p>
<p>I wasn’t trying to criticise you. It’s just the combo of using the same melodic structure in every track plus the ‘faux naif’ cover art confused me as to what you were aiming for.</p>
<p>If it’s all just about having fun for now, that’s totally fine. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>S’all good. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>About the cover artwork…<br>
Please do keep in mind sir, that I’m still a teenager, so I like things to be done my way!<br>
You can go ahead and say whatever it is that you think about my artwork, and I won’t take any offense to it! I tried for so many hours, HOURS, to draw that exact artwork cover, so if you don’t like it, that’s fine by me! I like it! Later I’ll use something more professional, but for right now, I’ll keep it like this.</p>

            <p>Yes. In all intents and purposes, I tried to make them sound very similar, but unique each and every single one in their own way…<br>
If that even makes the slightest sense…</p>

            <p>I checked this out.</p>
<p>Tbh, every track sounds pretty much the same.<br>
You seem to be using the same melodic structure in every track.</p>
<p>Is that intentional?</p>
<p>And re: the cover artwork…</p>
<p>Is the artwork meant to be… erm… ‘lo-fi’?<br>
Is it a stylistic choice? It’s hard to tell.</p>
