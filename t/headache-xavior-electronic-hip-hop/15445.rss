**Lyrics**
So much stress on my brain gave me a headache
Too much going on in my mind, can’t get my head straight.

Breaking away from all my irritations
See my homies doing dirt I’m changing my limitations
Got focused
No longer worried bout who be the dopest
I’m posted with my soldiers like it’s poetry in motion
From a place where the drugs and depression give us the lessons
I maintain my essence, cause I see my life is precious
Take 1
The cancer is hitting at stage 1
I&#39;m a broker for the culture, to save em exchange funds
Give my heart to the people around me
The drama drown me
Put a price on my head like a bounty, my mind cloudy
Had my ex holding me back, feeling like such a hostage
Everyday exhausted, never feeling exalted
Work for the man, no plan to advance
Just crippling my hands tryna get another chance
It’s a war going on outside, moving internally
My friends moving different, I think they kinda deserted me

So much stress on my brain gave me a headache
Too much going on in my mind, can’t get my head straight.

I wish things could be different, my fam drifting (huh)
Say I’m the gifted one, but never got the riches (huh?)
It’s my environment, plotting early retirement
Grew up inside a lions den, hardly knew about vitamins
Tryna make the world see me for my heart
Sometimes my noblest thoughts get corroded in dark
The jealousy start to rear it’s presence
But then I look inside and notice it’s just mere possessions
I never tripped about status but it’s the madness surrounding a name
I wish I had enough wisdom to silence the lames
I give my all to people, they give me nothing in return
All I wish for in the end is the power to discern
For the mileage that I burned
Love is not an emotion, it’s action
I give it freely in an orderly fashion
But that’s the problem
Trusting these people hoping for honor
It’s harder to connect with a person than a persona
I’m the man in the mirror, it don’t get too much clearer
Feds pulling the trigger they deleting how we shimmer
It’s a different code
My claymation is a different mold
Everyday I wake up I’m standing 10 toes

So much stress on my brain gave me a headache
Too much going on in my mind, can’t get my head straight.</description>

            <p>I definitely mixed everything in GarageBand, but really the stems and everything are produced in Auxy. I want to make everything in Auxy as much as possible, because it IS possible to craft everything there.</p>

            <p>Fantastic, great meshing of genres. Did you end up doing the final product in GarageBand or elsewhere? I could definitely see giving this some love in either GB/Gadget/Cubasis or yes haha… another Xavior x ICS might not be so bad</p>

            <p>Dude. I have to say, your music is amazing. It really brings me joy. Do you want to collab? I also have had some vocal experience so I could sing in it if you would like. But no for an answer is just fine. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
