    <title>Spotify song theft</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/spotify-song-theft/16089</link>
    <description>An artist that goes by the name ‘Asleep’ on Spotify has stolen numerous Auxy tracks and released them as their own on Spotify, some amounting to hundreds of thousands of streams and Spotify playlist features, pulling exposure, credit, AND MONEY away from the artists who deserve it. Those listed are among the discovered stolen tracks:

@decruz
@Produk
@s0phont
@Fantom87
@blackocean
@aUstin_Haga
@Conux

They have also released an Auxy demo medley as their own track.

Each of you need to head [here](https://www.spotify.com/au/legal/infringement-form/) to file a report. You deserve to be recognized for your work.</description>

<p>I’ll re-iterate, I don’t know we need a thread every time for this… and I don’t want these going on too long because like anything else they get incredibly off topic after awhile.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is just report the tracks on the platforms you find them on. I would not interact directly with people who do this, I don’t think anything good comes out of it. A cease and desist from SoundCloud or YouTube directly is going to be a lot scarier and effective than anything you could possibly say to someone who does something like this.</p>
<p>Going to button this up since it seems like it’s under control and everyone who needs to is reporting these individuals.</p>

            <p>I know the guy. I’ve dealt with him before. Him and Asleep “collaborated” on my song, The Heavens. I took care of it. Pretty sure Aidan McJoseph has cleaned up his profiles a good bit, so he’s not much to worry about anymore. At least, I don’t think…</p>

            <p>I think one important thing to consider in all of this is to try not to share your project links publicly. I know that nothing is stopping anyone from downloading or ripping a track offline and posting it as their own, but having the project link to yourself could be a good way to prove that it is YOURS if it comes to that.</p>

            <p>True true. I also misread <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/obexg">@obexg</a> response up there, so I thought he was referring to something else.
