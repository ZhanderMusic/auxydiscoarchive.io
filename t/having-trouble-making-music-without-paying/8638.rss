    <description>Hey guys, Andrew here. I haven&#39;t posted in weeks, and this is why. I need help.

So, after the update for Auxy 5, I went to make music with the brand new update. However, because I have not bought any sound packs or a subscription, I am stuck with 2 drum kits and 16 drum samples. Thats all still good, but I cannot find a way to make music that is different because I am always using the same kits (and they don&#39;t really fit my style.) Because of this, I have a decision to make: Buy the subscription, find a way to make do with what i have, or find a software or app to go alongside auxy.

As music-making is no longer my top priority because of this setback, I am having trouble getting back into it, and I havent made any music for weeks. 

 But, what do you think? Are there any softwares that go well with auxy? is the subscription worth it? Thanks everyone for the feedback; Its very appreciated. :wave:</description>

            <p>Two great free softwares for computer are 1) GarageBand and 2) LMMS. Both are great and open up tons of capabilities. If you still need more drums, google “free drum samples” and download some, which you can then import into GB or LMMS.</p>

<p>If you’re serious about music production, anything really, you need to have the right tools. You don’t see contractors walking into Home Depot asking for free hammers and power tools.</p>
<p>Even if it’s just a hobby at best, hobbies usually still cost money. I can’t even think of any free hobbies because there’s always SOME cost associated with them.</p>

            <p>You’re right. I did answer my question. I guess I’m really just lost at how the idea of “we think these drums are pretty weak” went to “Let’s put them in behind the subscription wall!” and “these 16 new weaker samples will definitely get new people to buy the subscription”</p>
<p>I don’t mean to trash the devs. I know Auxy is a good and powerful app, but I also know new people just trying out the app don’t nor know that it’s supposed to be a subscription based app.</p>
<p>Really, there’s not much more I can say that hasn’t been said so I’ll just leave things be.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because the end goal for them is to have it be a purely subscription based app. Now I don’t necessarily agree with this and see some potential problems, but at least you now know what their reasoning is for putting the previously free drums behind a paywall.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stickmanadventures">@Stickmanadventures</a> A lot of the other users on the thread are raising valid points. If you’re aiming to become more serious about music producing, you are almost certainly going to run into the need to break out your wallet. It’s just a question about how much.</p>

            <p>sure you can, but things were simpler before when you only needed 1 kick as a free user whereas now you need a minimum of 2 kicks and a pitched down tom.<br>
you also need 2 snares and a clap to act as a single snare</p>
<p>Overall though, what <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/stickmanadventures">@Stickmanadventures</a> is having issues with (and what most free users are mad about with) Auxy 5 is the fact that the drums were taken away for no reason.</p>
<p>The devs said they wanted to move to an app where everyone is on the subscription, but that just doesn’t make any sense if you can’t even show Auxy as being powerful without needing to pay.<br>
They also said that they removed them as presets because they thought they were weak drums.  But instead of just adding them as free drums (since they think they’re so weak) why would they put them behind a pay wall and give free users even weaker and less drums before they even consider paying $5 a month?</p>

            <p>I’m also in a similar position where I’m stuck using the free pretty basic samples. I’ve been able to somewhat make do by using hella layers for kicks,snares n stuff.</p>
<p>As for other DAW’s. U could start with GarageBand. It’s free and pretty powerful if u can learn your way around it.<br>
It doesn’t really “work with” auxy, but u can use it to import your tracks n stuff and work on them.</p>

<p>This is most likely your best course of option. You can program out how you want the drums to sound and then recreate it in another program such as Garageband, they’re at least serviceable. If you still have any old projects with the original kits in them, you can duplicate those projects and make do with whatever drum kits were in them as well. It’s not the best solution but it’s the only other option.</p>

            <p>If you really don’t want to pay, you should try Soundtrap. It’s really easy to use, and free. It requires a computer… and maybe a MIDI keyboard if you have one.</p>
<p>Levi Niha made a video on it quite recently, calling it the only online music maker comparable to Ableton or FL:</p>

<p>Don’t use the loops btw, those require 0 creativity <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also, the synths aren’t that great, but there is a premium… you get a seven day free trial tho <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=5" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"> (use multiple emails xD)</p>

            <p>FL is great, only $200 for a well stocked version. Also the subsctiption is well worth your money because 1) it supports Henrik and Fredrik, (it is not usual to have something of Auxy’s caliber come at no cost) and 2) it unlocks so many possibilities and other new things you can do with the app. I say go for it.</p>

            <p>Auxy is awfully cheap compared to a bunch of other music software. I was in your position before, though. You should try getting the free trial and decide if it’s worth your money.</p>

            <p>This is the reason why I don’t use Auxy 5 as much as Auxy 4</p>
