Ever since BTC 25 I was inspired to create or at least attempt to create a decent piano song, I appreciate if y’all can give feedback to make a better one for the near or far future.</description>

            <p>I like me a piano piece so I gave it a listen. My basic criticism is that it’s a little repetitive and it lacks structure to generate much impact during your climax. It just seems to build and build and doesn’t end up anywhere.</p>
<p>Also, I think it’s important that you write your piano pieces with the reverb off. Sometimes, even I am caught in the beauty of reverb on the piano and I can’t hear my own boring repetition and mistakes. When I turn it off all I hear is bleh, bleh bleh bleh, bleh, bleeh. And I’m like, “jakers, without the reverb this is just a bit boring”.</p>
<p>Also, go look at some midi rolls or piano covers on YouTube, and you might pick up some cool stuff there!</p>
<p>But honestly, it’s not an ugly piece. There’s a tonne of potential. Rather than writing a new piano piece from scratch, I would go back and add onto this, and maybe structure it so it ain’t so repetitive.</p>
