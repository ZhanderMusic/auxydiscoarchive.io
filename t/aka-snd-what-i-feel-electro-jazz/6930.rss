    <title>AKA.SND - What I Feel [Electro-Jazz]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/aka-snd-what-i-feel-electro-jazz/6930</link>
    <description>First half-proper attempt with v5. Really enjoyed working on it and quite pleased with how it turned out.

[AKA.SND - What I Feel (4:24)](https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/what-i-feel) (Electro-Jazz, Electro-Funk.)

[![What-I-Feel-sml|300x300](upload://uSarPj4AC0136HgVNFhkbiMqtnr.png)](https://soundcloud.com/akasnd/what-i-feel)

&amp;nbsp;
There are a couple of things I plan to tweak (my usual &#39;go-to&#39; lead sounds _&#39;so V4&#39;_ now) ;)

Let me know your thoughts, here or on SoundCloud. :+1:</description>

<p>Not too heavy, but not too light</p>

<p>I feel the vibe could benefit from being made a little darker. For example, the vintage keys section that starts ~2:45 gets a bit light in the upper register. The higher tones are too light, imo, given the overall vibe of the main groove. Maybe not taking the melody so high would ‘fix’ it, or maybe layering in another sound to add grit.</p>

            <p>I really like it.  Great use of samples.  Not too heavy, but not too light.  It’s good.</p>

<p>I personally don’t feel that what I can produce in Auxy is as good as I want the tracks to be before a proper release, so I’m unlikely to be ‘finishing’ any songs in Auxy.<br>
(I’m happy to work with engineers, so I can focus on the ideas, the composition, shaping the sound, the base production, etc…)</p>
<p>I’ll be working with a producer/composer friend in the music biz to start properly engineering, mixing ‘n’ mastering a series of my existing and future tracks – and then she’ll start pushing them out to her label contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
That said, if I dabble in some proper Lo-Fi/Chillhop, which I want to do, I could probably get that to release-ready entirely within Auxy, so… let’s see. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Nah, it’s good to kick the tyres on how I think and talk about my music. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Sure, it would be good if there was more feedback; what’s working well, and equally useful, what’s not working so well. But, either way, I’m glad that it seems to be appreciated.</p>
<p>Also, it seems to be attracting plays, etc… faster than anything I’ve previously done, so that’s a good sign.</p>
<p>Now, if I can just catch the eye (ear) of a certain Auxy-related SC channel… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Edit: You put out so many incomplete projects and I love your tracks as they are. At this point, I suspect you have way more than an album’s worth of material. I can imagine that anything you put at this point that actually you consider finished would be pretty epic.</p>

            <p>Listening to that Bryce Fox track.<br>
My point of reference for that sound would be Jack White…</p>
<p>It would certainly make an interesting direction to take ‘How I Feel’.<br>
Interesting to wonder how ‘that version’ would turn out.</p>

<p>every dissonance must solution to conssonance</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d also challenge that. Sometimes dissonance is the thing you want, for the style and character. Not necessarily resolving back to consonance.</p>
<p>I have a little dissonance in this track, destabilising the chord. But, I like that. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It’s fine. Not angry or upset, or ‘not calm’, at all. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The issue was that you seemed to discount the track as jazz-related because it didn’t have complex harmonies.</p>
<p>I don’t doubt your knowledge. I simply challenged the assertion that it was closer to alt-rock than jazz.</p>
<p>It’s all good and all friendly. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Omg guys, but keep calm, it’s only my opinion, I’m playing in BigBand, and I played in jazz quartet so I know something about. And as you said, it isn’t impossible but it is hard, according to music theory, doin a chord with 7,9 or 11 which will sound good in electronic music is so hard. And 13? So hard guys, because every dissonance must solution to conssonance. But if you disagree I understand.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kayashokayasho/itorinormxkayasho">not impossible</a>. And not all forms of jazz use complex harmonies.<br>
Jazz is as much about flow, sensibility and rhythm as it is about harmony.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, being a fan and regular listener of Bebop/Hard jazz (Coltrane, early Davis, Monk, Art Blakey, etc…) I love a good jazz chord sequence. Those harmonic progressions are characteristic to jazz, possibly unique to jazz, but they’re not the only thing that defines whether something falls inside ‘jazz’ or not.</p>
<p>So, there’s plenty to take from jazz without it having to be based on complex harmonic progressions.</p>

<p>for me in first moment sounds like Horns by Bryce Fox</p>

<p>Interesting. tbh, I’m not hearing much similarity, other than a stomp beat.</p>
<p>If anything, my track is closer to the more electronic end of R&amp;B, (though with a heavier sound than is typical), than alt-rock, electronic or otherwise.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I don’t understand what this means. I’ll concede that without a playing surface it’s more of a pain in the butt, but, it’s certainly not impossible for the patient.</p>

            <p>So because I am a musician and it is what I’m doin for life, I can tell you one thing.<br>
Jazz, and every type of jazz has a difficult harmony. It’s  very hard to do this with Auxy.<br>
And second thing is fact that for me in first moment sounds like Horns by Bryce Fox, and it is an electro alt-rock <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Really? That’s interesting.<br>
What aspect of the track do you think gives it an alt-rock vibe?</p>
<p>It would be good to hear an alt-rock track that you think occupies a similar space to this one, to help me understand.</p>
<p>Also, what do you consider electro-jazz?</p>
<p>I’d concede that it’s not ‘clearly’ electro-jazz, but I think electro-jazz is still the closest fit. It’s just evolved a bit from there. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

It’s never easy finding my genres.</p>

            <p>It sounds more like alternative rock, than electro-jazz, but it’s awesome!</p>

            <p>Thanks.<br>
I actually wanted the beats to be more polyrhythmic and slightly broken, but I’ve lost that along the way.<br>
The 3/4 roll and slow swing dominates now.</p>
<p>Still more work to be done. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I would def say keep it slower. The off beat drums lend themselves to a slow roll tempo for sure</p>

            <p>I did a little judicial selection and chopping around, to artificially add a note here or there. Other than that, pitching it down two semitones was all I did.</p>
<p>The talkbox isn’t layered in anywhere else.</p>
<p>Simple ingredients. Good food. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as those talk box samples come in tho…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, that got me too. Played around with it and I was grinning ear to ear, <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/dont-you-just-love-it-when/2883/275">enjoying it so much myself</a> with a bit of upper-body ‘desk dancing’. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awesome, not much else to say!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks. Means a lot.</p>
<p>Needs a few tweaks here and there, and a good mix n master, but I think it’s mostly there. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
(Though, I’m wondering if it could do with a tempo nudge upwards, or whether the lazy, dragging tempo adds to the ‘slow n sweaty’ vibe.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[Edit]</p>
<p>The more I listen to it, the more I want to bring it down to a more ‘low n sleazy’ vibe (in a good way).</p>
<p>I’ll need to bring the high keys down an octave – make the break more ‘sweaty’ – and I want to swap out the lead sound too, roughen them up.<br>
Want to swap in some gospel backing harmonies too.</p>
