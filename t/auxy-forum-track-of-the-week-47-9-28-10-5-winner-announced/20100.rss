    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-47-9-28-10-5-winner-announced/20100</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* zhandermusic
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial
* Goxenar

Judge this week is: @AzureOnyx 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961). 

**PLEASE NOTE: If you change your title in profile settings from ‚Äúblank‚Äù to Regular, or vice versa, YOU WILL LOSE ALL CDS AND UNICORNS!**

            <p>Thanks, <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/azureonyx">@AzureOnyx</a></p>
<p>I really enjoyed making it. I seem to be in a fruitful mode with my Black Node stufff.<br>
And, yeah, I like vining to it too, even though I‚Äôve heard so many times.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve already got <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/wip-black-node-embers-stripped-back-jazz-fusion-electronic-thoughtful-noise/20158">the next one</a> well under way, and that‚Äôs almost all vibe.</p>
<p>So, I‚Äôll be shooting for a hat-trick soon. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>I do deeply apologize for the long wait, truth be told, there has been a lot of events that happened to me irl that prevents me from properly deciding which track is worthy for a disc.</p>
<p>That said, today, I have dedicated my time and energy to listen to all of the submissions for this week. I have decided that <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/thoughtfulnoise">@ThoughtfulNoise</a> is worthy of getting this week‚Äôs disc.</p>
<p>The other submissions were on par with this week‚Äôs winner in their own right, but based on which song I can vibe to the most, ThoughtfulNoise is this week‚Äôs winner.</p>
<p>Congratulations for your second disc, ThoughtfulNoise!</p>

<p><strong>‚ì¶hat happens?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the <a class="hashtag" href="https://disco.auxy.co/c/contests/10">#<span>contests</span></a> category.</li>
<li>If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic.</li>
<li>The winner will be announced here at the end of the week.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>‚ì°ules:</strong></p>
