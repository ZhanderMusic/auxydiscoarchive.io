    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/thrashie-the-tokyo-underground-revived-project-vip-mix/8021</link>
    <description>So a long time ago I released a song that had a very favorable response from the Vidme community as well as YouTube (less so on YouTube) it also being a favorite of my own projects, I had to make a version for SoundCloud, so here you guys go. Something I’ve wanted to do for some time now. ![image|500x500](upload://vkOYeeGMyZDqwFbdXzBgxO4egvK.jpeg)
