    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-17-winner-announced/17065</link>
    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a Soundcloud link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks can&#39;t have been posted previously. This competition is for new releases. 
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;9. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;10. Project files won&#39;t be considered. Soundcloud links only. 
&gt;11. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;12. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* ICSleepers 
* Arimyth
* Hydrans
* AzureOnyx
* Goxenar
* Blakaz
* DadMother
* MisterMaster

The judge this week is... MisterMaster. 

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961).

            <p>The entries this week were all fun to listen to.  It was quite difficult to choose the winner.</p>
<p>BobTheGuyyyyy‚Äôs  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bobtheguyyyyy/fault-bobtheguyyyyy" rel="nofollow noopener">submission</a> was up first and set the bar high, with ‚Äòfault‚Äô.  6 mins and 38 seconds of skills. Lovely piano. The likely winner, presumably.</p>
<p>Fuujiya gave us smooth trap beats with his dreamy track, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fuujiya/dreamcast" rel="nofollow noopener">Dreamcast</a>.</p>
<p>WYA77 stepped onto the stage with purple hair, white shades and a fun submission about <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wya77official/so-you-heard-about-those" rel="nofollow noopener">tomatoes</a>.</p>
<p>Dadmother dropped a metal piece, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dadmother/ebbflow/s-NXGbY" rel="nofollow noopener">Ebb and Flow</a>.  Not your typical Auxy music.</p>
<p>Octave‚Äôs <a href="https://soundcloud.com/octave-72811140/instinct" rel="nofollow noopener">track</a> had a groovy almost old-school intro and was really easy to listen to.</p>
<p>KheeshKP served up some hot Chicken Noodle Soup trap, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc81SyZMasU&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a> visualisation.</p>
<p>I really liked  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/heyimjax/new-chapter-jax" rel="nofollow noopener">Jax‚Äôs entry</a>, which was stripped back to just what‚Äôs needed.  And a strong hook.</p>
<p>In the end, I couldn‚Äôt choose a single winner, so I‚Äôve chosen two - Congrats to BobTheGuyyyyy and Dadmother, for co-winning Track of the Week.</p>
<p>And others were very close to being selected.</p>
