Hey guys. Recently I had a close friend of mine lose his life to suicide. I started working on this track as a coping method and to make a statement. You are not alone and there is always someone to help you. It is called Project Hope. Hope stands for Hold On Pain Ends. Hopefully this can turn into some sort of mega collab to take a stand against suicide. Love yall.</description>
