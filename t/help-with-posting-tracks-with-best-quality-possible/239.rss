    <title>Help With Posting Tracks With Best Quality Possible?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/help-with-posting-tracks-with-best-quality-possible/239</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having a difficult time trying to get a file of a track with maximum quality onto my PC. I tried to send an uncompressed file to my PC from email but I always get a message that says the file is too large. The reason why I need assistance is because every time i post/download the track file as compressed or MP3, I get this &quot;glassy air&quot; sound that pretty much kills the track. I&#39;m also trying to get full quality because posting the track file to SoundCloud just makes the &quot;glassy air&quot; sound even worse. Anyways, some assistance would be nice. Thank You.</description>

            <p>Do you guys recommend reuploading the low quality tracks in high quality, or doesn’t it matter that much?</p>

            <p>Yes, we’re uploading the uncompressed wav to SoundCloud and then they create an MP3 file that they use for streaming. If you download from SoundCloud, you get the original file though.</p>

            <p>Can you use iTunes file transfer to get the uncompressed way render from Auxy onto your computer?  You definitely don’t want to upload an MP3 or M4a to Soundcloud. As you noticed they convert everything to a 128kbps MP3 (using a terrible sounding algorithm IMVHO) so you’re basically converting to MP3 twice then.  Transcoding like this should always be avoided, so I’d definitely suggest you try the iTunes method.</p>

            <p>When I upload a track directly from Auxy to Soundcloud, it’s quality on Soundcloud is less than when I play it in Auxy itself. Is there a way I can upload it to Soundcloud in the best quality possible?<br>
I hear some slight distortions in some of my uploads.</p>

            <p>If you export uncompressed wav you will get the highest quality export possible from Auxy. Like mentioned above, you can use e.g. Google Drive to transfer large files. Another way is to upload to SoundCloud and then download the original file via SoundCloud on desktop.</p>

            <p>I use Audacity. It’s free and I love to use it for exporting extreme quality MP3 files. You can also record with it and much more…</p>
