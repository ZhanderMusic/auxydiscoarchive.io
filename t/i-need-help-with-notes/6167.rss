I’m not very knowledable with notes and things because I’m a drummer in my high school marching band so I don’t get much practice with them. But in this little arrangement, the first 4 bars have chords that sound kinda serious and more of a deep tone. I wanted to change the chorus around so in the next 4 bars, I accidentally ended up with more sentimental and uplifting sounding notes. I really like the second 4 bars because of the uplifting aspect but I wanted to know if the first 8 bars work together in terms of their chords. And if they don’t, then how I could change the first 4 bars so they do work together. Thank you so much in advance!!</description>
