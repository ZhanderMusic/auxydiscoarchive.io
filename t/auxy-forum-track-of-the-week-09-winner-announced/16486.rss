            <p>Awesome!! Thanks a lot! It ended up being a quite minimal track focused on beats and groove, so I‚Äôm glad you think it is replay-able! I sure had a lot of fun making it.</p>

            <p><big> <strong>‚ì¶ho is the winner?</strong> </big></p>
<p>Thanks to those who entered this week. Each entry offered something appealing, in particular the leads and drum-fills stood out across the entries. It was hard to choose the winner, but one track had a chilled smoothness and polish to it, making it easy to listen to. It simply sounded the most professional. And that overall replay-ability is why it won this week.</p>
<p>Congratulations to <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/simon2">@simon2</a>   for winning Track of the Week for a second time.  He receives another  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/cd.png?v=9" title=":cd:" class="emoji" alt=":cd:"> icon next to his forum name. And his name is recorded as a <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961">Track of the Week Winner</a>.</p>
<p>The thread for next weeks competition will be posted soon.</p>

            <p>I tried to make a latin inspired track that would push the limits of creativity. I really aimed for the prize this week and took a long time to balance the volumes and technicalities. I also wanted to make something that could get stuck in your head! Hope you enjoy and hopefully you‚Äôre grooving or bobbing your head by the end!
