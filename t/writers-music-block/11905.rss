            <p>Yes same. Even if I try to copy a song, especially not from Auxy, I end up with something similar but quite different that sounds great, and then the more I put my own ideas into it, the more different and good it sounds.</p>

            <p>I’ve been stuck in a (general) writers block loop for like 4 months at this point. I’m always stuck between like 7 ideas that I kinda like but aren’t good enough I make into full songs. So basically I just mass produce ideas till I find one I like.</p>

            <p>I find it helpful to just start writing something based off another artist or track you like. heck, even copying a chord prog, drop style/rhythm, or even arp might help u generate an idea</p>

            <p>Same.</p>
<p>When you’re in a block, doing collabs can help. I’m doing a collab with someone rn and it’s a big help to my creativity. You could also try remixing other people’s tracks.</p>

            <p>Happens literally all the time. I just got out of a two-month writer’s block. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/upside_down_face.png?v=6" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"></p>
<p>A good way to get out of one is to listen to music from other people. It might give you an idea of what genre you want to make and then you may get an idea of how you want to execute it.</p>

            <p>I’ve found it helpful to…</p>
<p>Spend some time setting out a skeleton structure for the track. Having that in place can help highlight the changes in movement needed at each step.</p>
<p>Letting a track ‘build itself’ organically can be great when the ideas are flowing. But that approach can also leave you feeling rudderless when the ideas aren’t flowing.</p>
<p>If needed, find a reference track that you like and respect and analyse the structure - where the builds are, where the variation kicks in, etc…</p>
<p>This might trigger ideas and directions for how to develop the track.</p>

            <p>Something that has been helping me recently is to put set times as to when I upload tracks. Instead of being all rushed and try to upload tracks as much as possible, I have a set upload time. Recently I have been focusing on one track a month, but now I’m challenging myself to only post tracks once every 2 months</p>

            <p>I went through the same thing about a month ago. I had started releasing tracks on SC pretty quickly, and was usually spending 2+ hours in the app. After I released the last project that I had open, I just had no more motivation to release or even start new projects; I just had no ideas. To overcome this, I just took a 1.5 week break, and listened to some good music in the meantime. If I had an idea, I just made a project and created the one or two scene drop for it, eventually ending up with 6 or 7. Now though, I feel more refreshed and I’m just going through my projects and working a little bit on them each day and slowly, finishing them 1 by 1.</p>

            <p>Going through it atm. Tends to happen to me when I feel like I should be doing other tasks, and I juggle guilt when I decide to do something else, and the toxic circle ends up in me procrastinating everything.</p>
<p>My longest stint was when I was just trying to finish Ruthless. Nothing sounded right. Draft after draft after draft. But when I made a decision and planned to quit my job that I didn’t like (had been trying to quit for months), I was magically able to finish my track.</p>
