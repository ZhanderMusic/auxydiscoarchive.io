    <title>== Auxy Forum Awards 2019 - Nominations ==</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-awards-2019-nominations/17605</link>
    <description>Howdy Y’all! Yet another fantastic year with Auxy has gone by, and yes, I’m confident to say, this has been the best so far. With 2019 marking the 5th year anniversary of the app, we have seen Auxy change, and grow into the app we all know and love. Along with the app growing, something else has too. The wonderful Auxy artists that make up this community.

Enough of me talking…how exactly will all this work?

Each person will nominate their favorite Auxy producer per category between now, and **December 31st, 2019.**

At the **end of December**, the top 10 nominees from each category will be placed in polls, to be voted on until January 4th

Just like previous years, **there are a few regulations…**

1. Each person is allowed one post in the nominations thread.
2. Only nomination posts will be allowed (off-topic posts will be removed). You can chat [over here!](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-awards-2019-discussion/17607/2)
3. All nominations must use the nomination form below to make counting votes easier.
4. Only one nomination per category.
5. You can change your nominations by editing your post, but on 31st of Dec, the nomination thread will be locked for counting.
6. You can nominate yourself if you want… further voting will be completed by polls.
7. Nominated tracks should be created completely in Auxy ( “Completely in Auxy” meaning put together with Auxy. Tracks with samples are of course allowed)
8. You can nominate remixes, but mention the name of the original artist too.

**Prize**
The winner of each category will receive a unicorn and their name will be listed in the [Unicorn Hall of Fame](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-unicorn-hall-of-fame/5411)

**Nomination Form:**
Copy and paste this text into this nomination thread
**NOMINATIONS**:

&gt; Favorite Auxy Track of 2019 (specify TRACK_NAME + PRODUCER NAME)
&gt; Favorite Auxy Producer of 2019 (specify PRODUCER NAME)
&gt; Most innovative Track of 2019 (specify TRACK_NAME + PRODUCER NAME)
&gt; One individual who has been especially supportive of your music? Either here on the disco, on SoundCloud, through Discord, etc. (specify PRODUCER NAME / PERSONAL NAME)

**One final gift…**

Because 2019 was such an amazing year, we would like to give every one of you a special promotion. Thanks to the Auxy collective, a playlist will be made at the end of December sharing your personal best. Please do not post your track here, share it on [this thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/your-best-auxy-track-this-year/17606). Make sure it is your very own, personal best of 2019.

Phew… that was a mouthful.

Happy nominating, y’all! Don’t forget to tie up your Unicorns, they get rowdy in the winter time.</description>

            <p>Howdy Y’all! Yet another fantastic year with Auxy has gone by, and yes, I’m confident to say, this has been the best so far. With 2019 marking the 5th year anniversary of the app, we have seen Auxy change, and grow into the app we all know and love. Along with the app growing, something else has too. The wonderful Auxy artists that make up this community.</p>
<p>Enough of me talking…how exactly will all this work?</p>
<p>Each person will nominate their favorite Auxy producer per category between now, and <strong>December 31st, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>At the <strong>end of December</strong>, the top 10 nominees from each category will be placed in polls, to be voted on until January 4th</p>
<p>Just like previous years, <strong>there are a few regulations…</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Each person is allowed one post in the nominations thread.</li>
<li>Only nomination posts will be allowed (off-topic posts will be removed). You can chat <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-awards-2019-discussion/17607/2">over here!</a>
</li>
<li>All nominations must use the nomination form below to make counting votes easier.</li>
<li>Only one nomination per category.</li>
<li>You can change your nominations by editing your post, but on 31st of Dec, the nomination thread will be locked for counting.</li>
<li>You can nominate yourself if you want… further voting will be completed by polls.</li>
<li>Nominated tracks should be created completely in Auxy ( “Completely in Auxy” meaning put together with Auxy. Tracks with samples are of course allowed)</li>
<li>You can nominate remixes, but mention the name of the original artist too.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prize</strong><br>
The winner of each category will receive a unicorn and their name will be listed in the <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-unicorn-hall-of-fame/5411">Unicorn Hall of Fame</a></p>
<p><strong>Nomination Form:</strong><br>
Copy and paste this text into this nomination thread<br>
<strong>NOMINATIONS</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Favorite Auxy Track of 2019 (specify TRACK_NAME + PRODUCER NAME)<br>
Favorite Auxy Producer of 2019 (specify PRODUCER NAME)<br>
Most innovative Track of 2019 (specify TRACK_NAME + PRODUCER NAME)<br>
One individual who has been especially supportive of your music? Either here on the disco, on SoundCloud, through Discord, etc. (specify PRODUCER NAME / PERSONAL NAME)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>One final gift…</strong></p>
<p>Because 2019 was such an amazing year, we would like to give every one of you a special promotion. Thanks to the Auxy collective, a playlist will be made at the end of December sharing your personal best. Please do not post your track here, share it on <a href="https://disco.auxy.co/t/your-best-auxy-track-this-year/17606">this thread</a>. Make sure it is your very own, personal best of 2019.</p>
<p>Phew… that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>Happy nominating, y’all! Don’t forget to tie up your Unicorns, they get rowdy in the winter time.</p>
