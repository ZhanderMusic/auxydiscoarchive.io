    <description>&lt;big&gt; **====&gt; ‚ì£—èùìê·∂ú“ú œÉùñã ùê≠‚íΩ·∫∏ ÔΩó—î‚Ç¨–∫** &lt;/big&gt;  

**‚ì¶hat happens?**
&gt; * Each week a new topic (like this one) is posted in the #contests category.  
&gt;  * If you want your track considered for track of the week, just post a link to your track below, before the due date listed at the bottom of this topic. 
&gt;  * The winner will be announced here at the end of the week. 

**‚ì°ules:**
&gt;1. Track must be made by the submitter, using Auxy. 
&gt;2. There are no set themes. Any genre. Any tempo. Any automations. 
&gt;3. Tracks must be 60-seconds or longer. 
&gt;4. Tracks submitted must premiere the week of the TotW posted.
&gt;5. One entry per person, per week. 
&gt;6. No collabs or remixes. 
&gt;7. You can edit your post during the week if you make updates to your submission.  
&gt;8. External samples can be used for individual instruments or vocals only 
     ie: not sections of sampled music or drum loops.  
&gt;9. Project files won&#39;t be considered - **judges reserve the right to see project files if the legitimacy of the track is in question!**
&gt;10. Late entries won&#39;t be considered. Enter in the next week instead. 
&gt;11. Please also create a thread for your track under #tracks, like usual, if you wish. 

**‚ìôudging:**
One winner is chosen each week, or possibly a draw. Judging will be totally subjective. Please don&#39;t ask why your track didn&#39;t win.  The judges alternate between: - 

* cursed
* blakkaz
* AzureOnyx
* MrSerpent
* Mr_Mooo
* zhandermusic
* Peregrihn
* Dadmother
* HexxOfficial

Judge this week is: @peregrihn

**‚ìürize**
* Winner gets a special üíø icon next to their forum name. 
* Winner&#39;s name is also listed in a [winner&#39;s thread](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-winners/15961). 

**PLEASE NOTE: If you change your title in profile settings from ‚Äúblank‚Äù to Regular, or vice versa, YOU WILL LOSE ALL CDS AND UNICORNS!**

            <p>Correct, in this case the track must be released some time between 8/17 and 8/24 (morning, Eastern time) to be eligible for week 41. If you attempted to submit after the cut off then you should submit for week 42.</p>

            <p>Yeah so, gray area. Rule four says the track has to premiere the week of. It‚Äôs definitely been uploaded this week. But it‚Äôs not a complete track.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm gonna have to say it‚Äôs not valid because people are submitting completed works, and if this is a work in progress then it should premiere in its entirety in a future week. I think that makes more sense</p>

            <p>Same question as FRUDS, did Hexx have any involvement with the writing of the track or vocals only that you fit to the song?</p>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying.<br>
Guess I won‚Äôt be submitting my uptempo jazzy DnB thing for TotW then <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>(It uses a 4-bar drum loop from Landr Samples as the main beats, albeit at double speed.)</p>

            <p>Yup so the point of this rule was that people wouldn‚Äôt bring in entire melodic loops, like a four bar loop, or a two or four bar drum loop that they snagged from like loopmasters, or an app like blocs wave, etc. That‚Äôs why judges reserve the right to see the project file if there‚Äôs any doubt.</p>
<p>If you take a drum loop, cut it up into pieces and re-arrange it, that‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm also a big proponent of taking melodic loops, cutting those up, and re-arranging the pieces. It‚Äôs a worthwhile exercise and usually sounds TOTALLY different <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Quick question‚Ä¶</p>
<p>What if the track uses a drum break sample loop as the main beats?</p>
<p>You can‚Äôt submit a track if it uses (e.g.) the Amen break in its original form as the main beats (as an imported sample)?</p>
