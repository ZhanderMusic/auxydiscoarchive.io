</aside>
<p>That’s possibly an over-statement.<br>
It’s true there are a good handful of users on this forum who have expressed that they’d like to see it return to Auxy. But, even as a % of total members here, it’s relatively small. One might assume that 90%+ of Auxy users aren’t on this forum. So, as a % of all Auxy users, it’s tiny.</p>
<p>…unless there’s another feedback channel that Auxy is listening to.</p>
<p>Point being, I think requests for MIDI i/o, AudioBus, etc… support is still some distance away from reaching a critical mass (where it makes good business sense to spend money [re-]supporting it).</p>
<p>The additional obstacle is that Lenberg believes that inter-app functionality isn’t the way forward. So, we’d need to break through his philosophical objection to supporting MIDI i/o, AudioBus, etc… first.</p>
<p>But, who knows, maybe they’ll surprise us. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yea, there’s no inner-app support with Auxy. However, you can import your Auxy song as a .wav file into audiobus, chop it up into samples and audio paste each sample into another app (iMaschine 2, Launchpad or GarageBand are great examples).</p>

            <p>Auxy does not have MIDI support or the ability to connect to external apps through audio sharing platforms, including AudioBus.</p>
<p>It’s not really known whether Auxy will support it in the future, although it’s definitely being pushed for by a lot of Auxy users.</p>
