            <p>Ok so I’m currently on The Alley (I listen backwards, sue me) and I’ve already loving all of this! I’m not sure which of these tracks were made using Auxy modern or Auxy original. I would love to try and remix Electric Vibe if that’s an auxy modern track and you still have it at <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a> I couldn’t get enough of that song!</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a>  Not much to say here honestly. I’ve listened to so many of your dank tracks. Guess I’ll give feedback on some new ones.</p>
<p>South Shuffle: Lovin’ the piano, idk about the ducker. Love the synth! The build up is awesome, and I’m shuffling to the chorus!</p>
<p>Okay, it’s impossible. You’ve got nothing to improve on. xD</p>
<p>Really like the chill feel to Late Hours btw!</p>

            <p>Your songs are all super groovy. I listened to your new release South Shuffle, and it’s really good. The new drums really helped.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/southborne">@Southborne</a> I enjoyed listening to your tunes so much. You are definitely one of my favorite auxy producers and your style is right up my alley. I still remember being new to the auxy forum, and then I stumbled upon Panther, which convinced me that making hard house in auxy is possible, so thank you for that! I love your bigroom tracks, they’re lit <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/fire.png?v=6" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:"> I also really like how you try to mix things up with more chill tracks, and they are awesome as well. My favorite tracks are definitely Leopard, Panther and Careful Whisper. Please don’t ever stop <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/v.png?v=6" title=":v:" class="emoji" alt=":v:"></p>

By the way, the introduction of Southborne you wrote is quite informative and well written.<br>
There are limited amount of information of every member and I know you need to spare time to write this,<br>
But I will really appreciate if you give us this kind of small description in every FMW(Forum Member of the Week).</p>
