    <title>EP - Images by bacs</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/ep-images-by-bacs/12407</link>
    <description>As I made this album and posted it a while ago. I personally quite not sure about it. It made me want to remake the whole album and add the original track of this project. I’m posting this here to get feedback. Or collaborate with other artist with this 5 track. Maybe something to improve on or tweak. Just let me know guys.</description>
