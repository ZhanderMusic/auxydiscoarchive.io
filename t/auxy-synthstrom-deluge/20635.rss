    <title>Auxy + synthstrom deluge</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-synthstrom-deluge/20635</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just going to put a pipe dream out there:  Can&#39;t our beloved but underpaid developer offer his genius interface to a small but very lively / popular  hardware company that (imho) desperately needs one?  Both parties have a good understanding of what simple actually means...

My current setup is nice and light ... auxy on an ipad mini &gt; synthstrom deluge stereo in...no mixer or electrical outlet needed (!)... 

I arrange on auxy, (I still haven&#39;t found anything that is remotely as fast for automation and arranging) and then improvise stuff to those arrangements on the Deluge.  Deluge is great for sketches but not for finishing real songs.  I&#39;m not a fan of their implementation for arranging or parameter / knob recording for automation.

This sort of hardware / software combination would be *awesome* and way better than the clunky / obtuse stuff by akai, roland or elektron.</description>
