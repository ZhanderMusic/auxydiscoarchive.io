</aside>
<p>I’ve used Garageband and split the track onto multiple channels, renaming the project itself and soloing the desired track whenever I chop up samples. Sure it takes longer but I’ve found it useful. It also has some basic EQ tools so I’ve been able to take advantage of those. Then again, I do it on the iPad so it might be more difficult for iPhone users.</p>

<p>For chopping stuff up I use AudioShare, it’s a real swiss army knife of audio goodness. It’s not free though (I think it’s like $3.99? 4.99?). It’s worth it.</p>
<p>I know some folks also use AudioCopy (the Retronym’s branded app) - I have no experience with it though. That is free. There are probably others but those are the only ones I’m aware of <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback guys, I wasn’t sure anyone was going to like it. It’s surprisingly hard to keep a track minimal and interesting, I’ve taken your comments onboard and will make the amendments that have been suggested.</p>
<p>In respect to the bass line I may try removing elements and building on it as the track progresses, also I’m thinking after the breakdown at the second drop I may either go full on amen jungle or maybe minimal dnb.</p>
<p>In respect to chopping up loops does anyone know how to do that for free with an iPhone?</p>

            <p>Yeah I gotta listen/look again, if you’re using any of the boom basses, one of the controls (forgot which) usually adds a bit of overdrive. Automating that while bringing the drums out of half time would be BOMB AS <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/poop.png?v=5" title=":poop:" class="emoji" alt=":poop:"> no other way to express how awesome it would be.</p>

            <p>Thirded on the repetitive comment.</p>
<p>I like the general dark vibe.</p>
<p>I feel it could go dirtier. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[Edit</p>
<p>Could sound great with some MCing/toasting over the top.</p>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqM68Cl5b80">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqM68Cl5b80</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
(I really want to give dark dnb a try. Loving some of the stuff I’ve been checking out lately.)</p>

            <p>I really like this, I agree with El though it’s a tad repetitive. Your drum programming is ON POINT, after trimming down some of the bars before the strings come in I’d LOVE to hear you just let loose on the drums at full 175bpm. You’re generating a lot of tension in what you have here and sonically it’s super interesting, it’s just a bit drawn out.</p>
<p>That first sweeper seemed loud, the rest seemed ok. Listening in the car so it’s not exactly the best environment. This has a great groove for sure, I think tighten it up and even if you wanted to wait to blast on the drums until after the last two scenes that’d be cool, you’ve built up the tension at that point.</p>
<p>If you were looking for processed breaks to cut up (ala Amen break, the Think break) check out raggajungle.biz. There are links to sample packs there, complete with loops, hit based samples etc. I was getting heavy into jungle production but I think I’m taking a different route now. However, I found these in the interim and wanted to share - it’s a great resource.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what you change! But you’ve got a real solid foundation here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Heyyyyy das pretty good. I think the feel of the track is def there. And this could become something really interesting when it’s all done.</p>
<p>But the sweeper is hella loud/ on the upper end of the spectrum. Take off the pitch as it brings the sweeper too high.</p>
<p>Second, the drop is too repetitive. You pretty much just have the same 16bar loop 4 times (das a whole lotta bars for a whole lotta nothin happenin). There needs to be something added to that lead or just changing in general. (Yeah you change up the bass pattern, but ngl, I didn’t really notice too much because they’re pretty much the same anyway. They just don’t have an 8bar pattern. They just repeat a simpler one.)<br>
Example:<br>
<a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/ftry3xg-c3TSz5NCgEX8UA==" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://app.auxy.co/projects/ftry3xg-c3TSz5NCgEX8UA==</a><br>
(Hope u don’t mind me getting into ur project, but I just added some layers w/ automation on top of your current arp/ lead. U can change it to something better too if u like. I’m just stuck with the free stuff so I didn’t have much to work with)</p>
<p>But pretty much, you can have the same patterns/ loops, but there shold be something that changes with each loop.</p>
