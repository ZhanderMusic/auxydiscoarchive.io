            <p>Ford shorter vocal phrases, I use samples within Auxy, which works fine. At up to eight seconds per sample and eight samples per kit, you can cram a lot in there. For longer vocals, I import my finished mix into Auria and add the vocals there.</p>

            <p>Thanks I usually use GarageBand, but I just recently got Adobe Audition which is awesome, after finishing the beats I export it to adobe audition and it takes a while to synchronize everything but it worksüòÇ<br>
I‚Äôm still a noob though and I haven‚Äôt release anything with (my) vocals yet but I‚Äôm hoping to before 2019!</p>

            <p>You‚Äôre awesome man, that means a lot!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/katki">@Katki</a> If you‚Äôre using Auxy to import short vocal samples, it will work quite well. If you‚Äôre planning on adding a minute or so worth of lyrics, I would suggest using GarageBand. Simply import the Auxy created instrumental into GarageBand and add a mic‚Äô over the instrumental. That‚Äôs what I do.</p>

            <p>iOS has made it kind of difficult to work with vocals and build a track in auxy at the same time; I don‚Äôt do it that often. Ableton link is a bit glitchy.</p>
