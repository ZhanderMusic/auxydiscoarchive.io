    <title>Together As One - Eswyn</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/together-as-one-eswyn/8803</link>
    <description>I started a project 3 days ago. During the creation of this track, the Orchestral Strings sound pack came out. I was actually hoping to add strings to the track in an external program, but the timing worked out perfectly! I’ve been working extremely hard on this track for the last 3 days, and now it’s finished! This is the fastest I’ve ever written a track (and it might be my best)!

This song is dedicated to those who have lost their lives to needless gun violence and have been impacted by it. Today in the US, multiple ‘March For Our Lives’ rallies were organized by high schoolers protesting for gun safety and regulation. I traveled and participated in the one in Washington DC, and the stories of gun violence victims really impacted me. I sympathize with those who have felt the impact of gun violence, and that’s why I chose to dedicate this song to them. It’s important to remember that we’re never alone, we must work together as one. I hope you enjoy.
