    <title>Angles - Trazia X Moemx</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/angles-trazia-x-moemx/6910</link>
    <description>https://soundcloud.com/razianight/angles-ft-moemx  This track took AGES to finish but its mainly due to a lack of free time lately. I wanna thank @moemx  for working with me on this track. Honestly, you gave this track a focus and direction that I wouldn&#39;t have found otherwise. We built this from my BTC #19 entry and I couldn&#39;t be happier with it. Hopefully, some of you enjoy it, and I would definitely appreciate any suggestions or criticisms (everyone is a critic these days lol). Thanks again!</description>
