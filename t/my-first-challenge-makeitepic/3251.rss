    <title>My First Challenge-#MakeItEpic</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/my-first-challenge-makeitepic/3251</link>
    <description>Hi! 
I&#39;m Cole, aka BALLISTIK, and while I&#39;m a longtime Auxy user,  I&#39;m relatively new to this forum. This is my first challenge, so I&#39;m not gonna be too strict ;-) 
The requirements are simple: take the project provided in the link, and make it as fast, loud, and awesome as possible.  Feel free to change tempo, instrumentation, key, and structure. Just keep the _BASIC_ chord structure the same, and do not change the melody.  I would prefer you to keep it in a Major scale, but I am not going to make Minor against the rules.  Also, remember that this isn&#39;t a contest; I just want to see what you guys come up with. 
Have fun!

<p>I had fun, I think it’s a very pretty song, just needs a little more progression on pug specially. I played around with it for half an hour, now it’s in someone else’s hands</p>
