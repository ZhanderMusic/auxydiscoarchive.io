    <description>Hey guys, anyone wanna make a liquid dnb track with me? (Collab) 
I’m only around for 2 more weeks and then I’ll be gone for a long time. I love auxy but just haven’t had anything good to make on my own. There isn’t much DnB from auxy so maybe it’ll be fun to do something different and I love ambient sounds. If anyone’s interested let me know, I’d love to do something!</description>
