    <title>TotW interest check</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/totw-interest-check/21418</link>
    <description>I’d like to gauge interest around bringing back the track of the week. For details on what that is please see [this](https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-forum-track-of-the-week-49-10-12-10-19-winner-announced/20193).

I’d be looking for a handful of judges, preferably folks with an open mind and able to dedicate time to listening and selecting a track when they are the judge for that week. You do not need to provide feedback as part of these, though you are more than welcome to if you’d like.

Please send me a DM if you are interested, ultimately I’m looking for about five or six reliable folks to help drive this forward. Thanks!</description>
