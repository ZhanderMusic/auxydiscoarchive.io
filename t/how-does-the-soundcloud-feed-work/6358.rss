    <title>How does the Soundcloud Feed work?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/how-does-the-soundcloud-feed-work/6358</link>
    <description>
I follow a bunch of people of Soundcloud, but often the first time I see their tracks is when someone else re-posts it hours later. 

Does the Soundcloud stream work like Facebook ie: just because you follow someone you may not see all their tracks?</description>

<p>My hunch is that it has a filter preventing the same track to be shown multiple times in the feed, and then you see the last version, which is then a repost.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s what I’d been assuming. Makes a lot of sense.</p>

            <p>I think the SoundCloud feed is a mess in general and something they’re not prioritizing in their new experience (check the mobile app). My hunch is that it has a filter preventing the same track to be shown multiple times in the feed, and then you see the last version, which is then a repost.</p>

            <p>I think this is right. You could post something yesterday, and if it got lost in the shuffle and someone reposts it today I would only see it today unless I carefully went through my whole feed</p>

            <p>Ah I see, maybe the times when you’re inactive on Soundcloud or asleep the creator uploads it, then by the time you’re awake a bunch of people have uploaded it. That’s what I think.</p>

            <p>I see that stream too… but that’s where the reposts appear before I get them directly.</p>

            <p>For me, on desktop, the very first thing I see on the top of my stream is the latest reposted/posted track from anyone I follow.</p>
