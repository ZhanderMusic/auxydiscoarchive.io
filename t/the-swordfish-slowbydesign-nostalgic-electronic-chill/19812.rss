    <title>The Swordfish - SlowByDesign [Nostalgic, Electronic, Chill]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/the-swordfish-slowbydesign-nostalgic-electronic-chill/19812</link>
    <description>This, like a lot of my music, was inspired by the good times me and my older brother had playing Donkey Kong on SNES. Good times. Simpler times. 

Because of that - the DK/DK2 soundtrack still gets me. (and just because they‚Äôre fire)
