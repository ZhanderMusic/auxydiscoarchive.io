    <title>Auxy Synthesiser?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/auxy-synthesiser/18330</link>
    <description>I know a synthesiser is a huge feature to implement; but I feel it would put Auxy up there as a serious DAW (not that it isn&#39;t already of course ðŸ˜‰). Auxy uses the preset-tweaking model used by many other desktop DAWs, but differs by having no way to create your own wave.
I would personally suggest a wavetable synth due to - and this is subjective but hey ho - it&#39;s ease of use. Starting with a complex wave and applying modifiers and effects until you have your sound is usually very intuitive and ends up with a polished/finished sound.

**Edit**  
Just noticed wavetable synthesis has been implemented very effectively for the Europa synth in the Reason Compact iOS app â€” which I highly recommend you guys go explore!

What do you all think about this idea?</description>

            <p>Sounds cool!<br>
Itâ€™s not quite the same but 7Skies offers Massive patches for The Future and something similar (canâ€™t remember lol) for Destiny.</p>

<p>I mean I agree, but yeah, funny that someone posts exactly this today and itâ€™s answered on the other thread hahaâ€¦</p>
<p>And PS yeah, Europa in Reason Compact is one of the best sounding on iOS <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I guess another option would be to build an Auxy sampler so we could at least import a WAV sample of our favourite patches.<br>
Iâ€™m aware the Auxy drum machine has external sample and pitch shifting functionality, but not in a way suitable for an instrument.</p>
