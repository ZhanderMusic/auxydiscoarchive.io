    <title>Do you need a Title?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/do-you-need-a-title/13548</link>
    <description>Do you have a song or track that needs a title, but you can’t think one? Do you have a song that already has a title, but it just doesn’t fit the song, or just isn’t interesting enough? Do you have an album with songs that have names, but you need a title for the album? Do you have a song that is in an album that has a good name, and in an album that already has songs that have great titles, but you can’t think of a good title that fits the theme?

If so, I’m your guy!

If you need a title, send me your project or soundcloud link, and I will come up with **the best** title that suits your song. And the best part about it? It’s completely free!

Titles are the first impression of every song. No one wants to listen to a song called _project-1657392_or *untitled* , and nobody will find your song if it has a common name, which is why you need the best title if you want people to listen to it.

I will not rest until you are satisfied, sending you the best title names ever thought of until **you** are happy.

Don’t waste any of your brain power trying to come up with the perfect title, save it for writing songs, and leave the title to me; Or anyone else! If you have a title you want to suggest, post it here.

(P.S. this is kinda a joke, but if you would like me to come up with a title, I will be more than happy to!
