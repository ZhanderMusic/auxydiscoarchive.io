    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/im-new-to-the-community-and-im-looking-for-feedback/1162</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had this track in my auxy library for a while that I&#39;m hoping to get lyrics for from a friend and turn into a nu-disco/future bass kinda off-genre thing. Any feedback is appreciated!

            <p>Thanks for the feedback nick, I see that the drop was pretty loud so I turned down the volume on the synths, another version will be out shortly, I really appreciate the help.</p>
<p>Also I‚Äôd be totally down to collab, but I gotta finish some other projects up first. I‚Äôll shoot ya a message when I‚Äôm ready!</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Yo this is amazing, maybe work on mastering a bit, the first drop is way too loud, but it‚Äôs a pretty solid track overall, if you ever wanna collab just shoot me a melody or something on here</p>
