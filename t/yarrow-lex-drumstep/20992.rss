            <p>Ok so the start with just the melody I didn’t like. I think that it would sound better if you had the bass and the melody with a low pass slowly going up and that’s when everything else comes in. I thought that the drums were ok but probably my preference mostly because I like slower drums. So when the drop was coming up, you kinda ruined it (not to be mean I still like the project) with the dubstep part. I don’t like dubstep that much but the dubstep part on its own didn’t really have a clear note to base itself on. Also, the second part of the 1st drop when the lead came in, was where it got kinda messy. I would also like some more variation at the end. Could be my taste for music but you kinda mashed everything you had together into one at the ending and it sounded messy. Good idea, bad execution. Besides that, I still enjoyed listening to your song, good job! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"> Post more, I would like to listen to some more.</p>
