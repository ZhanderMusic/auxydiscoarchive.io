    <title>Falter - Hern [Experimental]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/falter-hern-experimental/19070</link>
    <description>Here is a bit of a strange case where I really had no idea what to select as a single for my new album, as really any song I would pick would be misleading in some way. I have chosen this song as I think it&#39;s one of the more instantaneous and straight forward songs on the album. However, don&#39;t expect the album to be like this song.

This is a piece of experimental plunder-phonics that samples things like Primus, RATM, Justice, and Soundgarden. I don&#39;t assume that many people will be into this at all, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been so hesitant to release anything from this album. 

Anyway, the song is here: https://soundcloud.com/hernmusicofficial/falter

Hope you enjoy and if you didn&#39;t please tell me why. Try to keep criticism constructive.</description>
