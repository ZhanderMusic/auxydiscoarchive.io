    <title>Have you ever hummed a really good song in your dream?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/have-you-ever-hummed-a-really-good-song-in-your-dream/14360</link>
    <description>*(This is a pretty random topic)* but...

Ok so I had a dream last night where I was at my friend’s house for some reason and I was playing around with Auxy (for some reason I also was using an iPhone X... I don’t have one irl) and I was humming about a seriously good song. I had chords and everything, including the percussion, nailed in my head in my dream, and then I wanted to start making the song into an actual project. 

Then comes the weird part, and I got interrupted by other weird dream-stuff and then I eventually woke up this morning. Now, I remember a little bit of the idea, but I’m having a lot of trouble remembering what the chords and everything were. (I’m not making this crap up, it actually happened to me in a dream) 

Also it reminds me of the Vivrant pack video on the Auxy YouTube channel where Jeremy Olander talks about people waking up in the middle of the night with melodies in their head. 

Has this ever happened to you guys? It’s a really *really* weird question, but I’m just curious now...</description>

            <p>Usually i have lyrics that sound great in my head, but when i sing them, they make no sense and most of the time dont even rhyme. and that usually happens at 3:00 in the morning, so its rare for me to even remember what they are.</p>

            <p>Almost every night, before I go to bed I hum a melody, sometimes I sing lyrics sometimes I don’t and then It’s just a matter of whether I want to get up and write the lyrics on a sticky note or not…My laziness usually wins <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/joy.png?v=6" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>

            <p>Every time I try to lucid dream it doesn’t work. In my dream I end up “realizing” im in a dream, but I still do random stuff that I otherwise would have done in real life. Or I’ll say, “oh I’m in a dream!” And then I’ll keep on doing whatever I was doing before in my dream. It’s not really lucidity and it isn’t very fun…</p>

            <p>Yep. I had a dream about geometry dash ( mostly because I play it way too much ) and I was playing a level with a song I’d never heard before - made with Auxy - and I’m slowly making it into a full track to this day :]</p>

            <p>The way that I’ve done it started when I was really young. I used to have nightmares all the time when I was a lot younger and the way I fixed this was by trying to recognize that I was in fact having a nightmare and then once I did realize it, I would repeat “just open your eyes - wake up” to myself and try my hardest to physically open my eyes. Kinda hard to describe, but it got me out of a lot of bad dreams.</p>
<p>However, I realized that I can tell when I’m actually in a dream—most of them have the same weird characteristics and if I manage to “step back” in my dream, then I can understand what I’m doing. Also, I have to try and be careful not to get too excited because then I’ll just wake up and the dream is ruined.</p>
<p>Idk how to actually start recognizing that you’re in a dream, but I could say that if you have a weird dream and you remember it when you wake up, just implant in your mind that the memory you have was in fact a dream. Over time, you should be able to recognize when you have a dream based on some patterns of your past memory.</p>
<p>Then, once you’re actively in a dream and you recognize what’s going on, it becomes like normal living, except you just have to physically think of what you want to do and think of what you want to happen.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>I’ve had that exact same thing happen, chords, melody, and all happen twice and it’s wonderful bliss until you can’t remember it to put it in the works…</p>

            <p>This might be one of my favorite posts on the disco. Yes, this is a real phenomenon, and yes, this has happened to me, and yes, I’m really excited about this for some reason.</p>
<p>I’ve had anywhere from simple melodies to full melody / bass / drum combos run through my head while partially / fully lucid. 90% of the time I’d forget these melodies as by the time I actually got to writing them down, I wouldn’t be able to remember them anymore (I believe it’s something to do with the transition from a semi-conscious state with greater access to the subconscious mind to a more fully conscious state).</p>
<p>Anyway, the beauty of a mobile studio is, I can sleep with an iPad / iPhone next to me and immediately get ideas down as I have them. I’ve woken up at anywhere from 3-5 in the morning with some song idea I’ve had while lucid and immediately put it down with almost no loss in clarity.</p>
<p>So with everything impressive about Auxy and how powerful it is on a mobile device, I think the true wonder comes from that portable nature and being able to take music composition with you everywhere.</p>

            <p>The interesting thing about this is that i can only think of Sleep Walk by Santo and Johnny.<br>

The story behind the song reminds me of this.

            <p>I’ve heard songs often in my dreams. Usually piano. Probably since I have a playlist of piano songs I play softly to help me sleep xD</p>
<p>Used to be a playlist of Fall Out Boy songs. Often when I was about to wake up, I’d hear the songs playing and the dream would morph around them. From me singing along to it to it being heard in a professional orchestra theatre (this was for the piano songs though). My dreams are always kinda weird, though.</p>
