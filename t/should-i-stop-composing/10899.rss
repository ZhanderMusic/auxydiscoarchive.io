    <title>Should I stop composing?</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/should-i-stop-composing/10899</link>
    <description>A thought that has been in my mind for a while. A few days ago I had realised that my skills that lie in music production and playing video games aren’t that helpful when it comes to life in general. And I’m never happy when I listen to my tracks after listening to the genius works of the rest of the auxy community. I don’t think I’ll ever get to where I aspire to be, so should I just keep trying or stop it all?</description>

</aside>
<p>I’ve <em>spent</em> exponentially more time listening to music than creating, thanks to a life-long passion for listening to music and a 25 year hiatus from making it.</p>
<p>My problem is that I can hardly listen to music now without it inspiring an idea that I absolutely must try out right at that very moment.<br>
(I actually took a break from listening to new music a while back because I knew it would inevitably inspire a new idea – and that would distract me from other priorities. Sounds daft, I know – though perhaps it’s a sign that I’m doing the wrong things with my life. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/wink.png?v=10" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Yeah it’s applicable to anything really. Even now I’m listening to music, I must listen to music at least 50% of my waking hours. Sometimes for enjoyment, sometimes in a very analytical way. It keeps the gears turning</p>

            <p>Thank you for that Stephen king quote. It really hit home, because I often write music without ever really listening to other people’s music. It’s something I am going to work on changing, as I know it will help me become a better musician myself.</p>
<p>A bit off topic but I still found it important</p>

            <p>Don’t stop ever if you feel discouraged. I don’t want to be repetitive from all of the other responses, (which cover a lot of my points), but you just have to try and focus on one genre that you really like. Then, I would recommend listening to a ton of songs from that genre and once you feel like you like the songs enough, try creating them in Auxy. Even if you try to copy the melody or bass line or any element of the song note for note, it will still help you learn the basics of making melodies, bass lines, percussion, and all of the elements that make up a good song.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long you’ve been making music or using the app. However, I can completely sympathize with you. I started a year ago, a complete mess with no experience with DAWs, music production, and didn’t have any level of musicality, except for humming random melodies that I came up with for fun. The first few projects, I went try hard, and gave my best shot at making the melodies in my head. It came out like garbage. At the time, I felt so discouraged because I thought I would never be able to make anything. In your situation, I feel like you’re running into the same problem.</p>
<p>It’s also always a good thing to look up to some of the more popular Auxy creators and aspire to be like them. And as others have already said, even they probably started using Auxy in the same way, and their first songs probably sounded like garbage too. It happens to everyone. Point is, you just need to work at it. As cliche as it sounds, it’s really the only way to get better. Look up tutorials on how to make the specific types of songs that you’re trying to make and explicitly copy them. It really helps. Also look up general music guides, although sometimes they can be boring. If you’re interested, check out a guy named Andrew Huang on YouTube. He has some pretty cool stuff, some really nice songs, which he has some parts of, and even did a segment about Auxy a while back.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, keep working and don’t give up. Put the time in, even an hour or two every day if you can just to give yourself more experience and time to learn. If anyone does this, puts in the work, and dedicates the amount of time long-term, then they too can become as good as the most popular Auxy producers right now.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, if you are really not happy and don’t want to focus on this, then I would recommend taking a break for even a day or so. Come back to it later, and think about different things. If you’re still not happy, then maybe it isn’t for you. Also, don’t consider it a waste of time or something that you won’t be able to continue in the future. Consider it like a hobby for now <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>You’ll find that in time you will find the right genre that you can make easily and flawlessly, until then, keep striving to find it!</p>
<p>I used to try to make trap, but you can go see how that turned out on my soundcloud <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> then I found Future Bass, Which to me was easy, not that really what my main genre is!</p>
<p>I feel that one day you’lol find your main genre you enjoy making and listening to, like I said above, keep striving to find it!</p>

            <p>Victim mentality in the arts is a no no. You’ve got this. No one starts off good and no one who is ever good always feels good. Not liking your own work may mean that you have good taste and your skill doesn’t match YET. I am not good at performing YET. I am not good at public speaking YET. I was also not good at photography once and now I am. Number one rule is don’t give up. Bet you’re gonna fill in your free time with something else. Do you enjoy those things as much as music? If you do, do those things. However, if you love music or even like it and are just trying to double down on extra hobbies and eliminate them in favor of other more serious tasks then think again. Have fun and don’t be so cereals! You can be the best in music production… better than anyone who’s ever used Auxy, but quitting is the best way to guarantee you won’t be.</p>
