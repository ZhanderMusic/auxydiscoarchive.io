    <title>Listening to your tracks on Auxy</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/listening-to-your-tracks-on-auxy/5219</link>
    <description>last month i recal that you could listen to your tracks on Auxy and it will still play through when you turn your phone off.
ever since , possibly from an update, the music stops playing when you turn your phone off. if this was a glitch on my phone for a while then got fixed, it wasnt something that should have been fixed. 
@Auxy can yo make it so we can listen to our tracks while our phones are off? this is good for when i am walking between classes and i can listen to my track i am working on  so i can critique it with out my leg touching the screen when in my pocket and to save battery.

anyone ever remember this happening about a month ago?</description>

            <p>I like <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/cheddr">@Cheddr</a>’s thoughts on using SoundCloud, especially about being able to use comments to make notes about possible changes, etc…<br>
Good idea.</p>
<p>I personally dump mine into a specific playlist in Spotify, via the support for local files. (Done via laptop, but syncs and download automatically with my iPhone/iPad (while you’re still on the same network as the laptop.)</p>
<p>It means I have my own music and everything else in the music player app that I use most often.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://disco.auxy.co/u/Auxy">@Auxy</a>. Checked the article and the free apps it mentions (not willing to pay for apps just to try them). But I don’t think they will help me out.<br>
I like to keep things in one place, which is Auxy and I have lots of space (iPhone 7, 128GB) so I keep all my rendered projects there to listen. It’s just too much work if you have to export everything and load them back in another music player.<br>
(If Apple would only allow us to put music directly into the music app instead of connecting to iTunes.<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/triumph.png?v=5" title=":triumph:" class="emoji" alt=":triumph:">)</p>
<p>Anyways, would it be possible then to lock the screen while playing the renders? That would help out alot…</p>

            <p>When I’m not working on my projects, I listen to all my renders and I would LOVE it to be more like a music player! I thought about it many times and wished for it to have a continuous play and shuffle option. I’m sure lots of other users would appreciate these added functionalities. I understand if it’s not a high priority though.</p>

            <p>It’s possible, but that would mean we spend time building a music player, which is already available in other apps instead of working on other features that everyone wants.</p>

            <p>IDK, I don’t really get Ableton links. I was using it once while playing some game at my friend’s house, and he also has auxy, and all of a sudden his phone linked to the song, it was really weird so… yeah i don’t know.</p>

            <p>isn’t that possible to build in that function? I think other music making apps can do that, playing music in locked screen (except the youtube app -.-)</p>

            <p>I do this all the time (listening to what I’m working on while walking or driving). But, man, Auxy drains the battery like this! So I started posting things in progress to SoundCloud as a private track to save juice. Added benefit, if you can get back to your computer you can use SoundCloud comments to record what you want to edit with time stamps.</p>

            <p>No good to use it in this way. Better to drop your renders into e.g. the Files app or some music player app that you can use to listen while the phone is locked.</p>
