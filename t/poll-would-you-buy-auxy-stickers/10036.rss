            <p>Fwiw, imo, brand stickers are better when they’re given away for free as part of a larger offer - e.g. when buying a larger item of merch or a subscription.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how I overlooked that; thank you. I don’t want to infringe on <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4806:97640a.2.1">their trademark</a>. The poll is still useful, but I don’t think I’ll go through with this.</p>

            <p>You’d probably have to get them officially liscenced by Auxy or something, make sure everything’s legal. Auxy would probably make a bit of the revenue as well, since it’s their brand you’re selling.</p>
