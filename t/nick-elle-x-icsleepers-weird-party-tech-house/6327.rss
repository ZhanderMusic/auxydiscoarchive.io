    <title>Nick Elle x icsleepers - Weird Party [Tech House]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/nick-elle-x-icsleepers-weird-party-tech-house/6327</link>
    <description>@NickElle x @icsleepers proudly preset the  [Weird Party EP](https://soundcloud.com/icsleepers/sets/weird-party). 

Let&#39;s set the stage - It&#39;s been HOURS. You are THIRSTY. This seemed like a cool place to go at first. But now you want to leave. But where is the exit....

Shout out to my boy Nick Elle and Praxis Music, I had a great time working on this with you. Very different from what I&#39;d normally do but super enjoyable all the same!

**FUN FACTS:**

This actually is based off an Auxy track I wrote about a year ago called &quot;Weird Party I Can&#39;t Leave&quot; - I&#39;ve since taken it off my SC. I wanted to work on something before the new update came out and said &quot;Self, let&#39;s do something out of the old comfort zone&quot;. So I came up with four projects (of varying length) and around the same time Nick reached out. Everything was exported and sent over to Nick and he did the final arrangement and added various bits and bobs.

The EP consists of tracks 2-4 below. Track 1 is the original song that was done a year ago. Please feel free to have at these and mangle the :poop: out of them.

Track 1 - https://app.auxy.co/projects/ceZimlkowOg6m6x50q3qkA==
Track 2 - https://app.auxy.co/projects/4OW7wwJnEhdPkpi8OFoVfw==
Track 3 - https://app.auxy.co/projects/kd8dcp26UNAQ1VpE1FqYcw==
Track 4 - https://app.auxy.co/projects/ywu7eBOlXR-RQQDqN20I4g==

Anyway, enjoy! Feedback and etc is welcome, as always :slight_smile:</description>
