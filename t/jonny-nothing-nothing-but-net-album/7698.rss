    <title>Jonny Nothing - Nothing But Net [Album]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/jonny-nothing-nothing-but-net-album/7698</link>
    <description>Hey folks, been using Auxy for a few months and have produced over 100 tracks just this year and am having a blast cultivating this new talent I didn&#39;t know I had.
I did not consider myself a musician prior to discovering Auxy but I&#39;m really in awe at the power of this app. My friends are dumbfounded how I&#39;m creating so much music at this quality. 
This is my 6th concept album--I have been incredibly addicted to this app. I wrote this entirely in Auxy over about a week.
