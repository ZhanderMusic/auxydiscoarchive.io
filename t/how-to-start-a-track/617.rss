            <p>I usually make a chord progression first and then add a bassline or melody to it. I then put it in the key I want. After that I put some drums on.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I usually have a plan for each song before I even start using the app: 1) Intended tone/mood of the track (usually consistent with other tracks in the same EP/album), 2) Subgenre I’m aiming for (i.e. if I know I want to create a moombahton track, I know exactly what drum pattern to use and that makes it easier to get the beat started), and lastly 3) I decided whether or not the track is intended to have vocals or not because that will change the outcome of the track’s construction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, bass is my most important factor in each song because it lays out the foundation of a track’s sound. It’s what listeners will thump or sway too. I tend to keep bass patterns simplistic (even if the drop is 100% consistent of bass) because that’s just my style, but I always stress the importance of a solid bassline in a track.</p>
<p>Hope this helps one way or another <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I usually just start by making a 4x4 beat, duplicate it and then mess around in the copy (changing the last bar so that it’s more interesting to listen to and not as repetitive). When you are satisfied, you can blend it together into an 8-bar loop, which shapes up your song a little more. Then you can copy this 8-bar loop change it up again, for example by adding different instruments or changing the melody to keep it interesting (but keep it related to the first 8-bar loop, since you want to have a coherent song). This way your ‘jingles’, as you call them, can form the basis of your song ;).<br>
I usually work like this, since it works for me. I usually make house music though, so I don’t know if this is useful for you and the type of music you like to produce. I hope this helps you out a bit, good luck!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What’s the first thing you do when making a song? Where do you start?</p>
<p>I like to start by making a melody and some simple beats, but recently I’ve been having trouble putting loops together to form songs. I keep making little jingles and not full songs.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get going on these solo tracks?</p>

            <p>I start with a basic bass line to get the feel I want then a chord progression and then a melody. Drums come last so I can work on them separately.</p>

            <p>I start with a bassline, then I just go from there, usually chords next (btw I love to add lots of notes to make chords sound THICC) Drums usually come after the chords, and then I go to melody and ostinatos and other things.<br>
I also like to construct the drop first, then work around that.</p>

            <p>It is the timing again. Your snare and clap can either go on the 1st or 3rd beat, not on anything else. All your melodies and bass and kicks need to start on the 1st beat. This is primarily to make it easier for yourself. You can replicate that for the rest of your song. Your melody typically needs to have a sense of finallity before it is repeated again. You did good on chords, it is just finallity. I added about 2 or 3 notes to the end of each. I edited your very last scene only.<br>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Make sure the whole audible spectrum is used. Don’t neglect your high and low frequencies. They have the most energy and make your drop LOUD. Reduce the volume on your chords or whatever is in the middle and turn up your bass and high end. Make sure you have a sub or something like it, and cymbals to every beat, preferably Charge’s as it has the best high frequencies, add some layers to your kick, something with a big thump to it, like North’s or Craft’s. Use some lush chords if you are going for something like future bass. Like OCTAVES apart chords. Don’t use much percussion other than claps or kicks, as they muddle your sounds if what you are going for is loudness. Make sure you turn down the volume on your buildup and that it is a decent length, no shorter than 4. ALWAYS have 1 bar of emptiness before the drop, with a sweep up. Make sure you duck some instruments to every beat to get people nodding their heads as well. And, that’s about it! Best of luck.</p>

            <p>Hey, the chords were nice, but the tension was never resolved with the tonic (the tonic is the key of your song, so for example you were in F minor, so your tonic should be an F minor chord) You had the notes of the Fm chord, but you played them out separately and it only increased the energy that you had no way of removing. I see you used inverted chords and that added a nice touch, but all that is not useful if you cannot RESOLVE them, that was only one problem. The next major problem, was your use of the beat lines. Your whole project was not on beat. It was off by 1/16. The thicker black vertical lines are there so you can keep track of the rhythm. So, every time the playhead touches a black line, your head should move down to the rhythm  and up in between them. The third minor problem, was your bass. Most of the time it should follow your chords, but in this case, it only repeated the Fm chord. That got boring quick since there was no progression to the song. I hope you use this criticism and keep working at it. This is not meant to discourage you, but said in hopes that you get better, and eventually start giving US tips hahaha. <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/88ZoA-oMKJlO4H1kMb9iog==">Here</a> is your song, revised, so that you can see what I am talking about. I also added a little of my own flair to the chords <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . The melody you had in mind for the piano could be added with another instrument so as to not take away from the chords.</p>

            <p>I couldn’t agree with you more. I even sometimes take it further and create the track name and then the song cover. I’m very visual so this helps me to get a mood going and then reverse from there picking instruments that either just plainly remind me of the track name based off the instrument name or they give me a feeling that matches that of the picture, and title.</p>

            <p>I do the opposite thing with the title, I’ll usually think of the melody and then make a title based off the mood lol</p>

            <p>For me it’s transitions, layers and the loop length. I try not to keep repeating 4 bar loops so I use transitions or make the loops longer.</p>
