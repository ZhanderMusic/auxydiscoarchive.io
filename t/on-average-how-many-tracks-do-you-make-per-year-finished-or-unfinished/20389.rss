    <title>On average, how many tracks do you make per year? (finished or unfinished)</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/on-average-how-many-tracks-do-you-make-per-year-finished-or-unfinished/20389</link>
    <description>Mostly just curious to see if anyone makes more or about the same as me on average each year.
On average, I personally make about 600-700 tracks per year (though gonna be a bit lower than average this year with only a bit over 300 tracks).</description>

            <p>Mostly just curious to see if anyone makes more or about the same as me on average each year.<br>
On average, I personally make about 600-700 tracks per year (though gonna be a bit lower than average this year with only a bit over 300 tracks).</p>
