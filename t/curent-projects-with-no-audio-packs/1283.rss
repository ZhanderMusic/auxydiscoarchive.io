            <p>It’s a little thing people like me call <em>Personal Preference.</em> I don’t do something because it’s a trend, I do it because I wanted to do something.</p>
<p>You obviously use Panda more than I do.</p>

            <p>I switched ur needy to a panda. Sounded quite a bit better. Dude. I know its way better with the packs we have now. But i used to do this ALL THE TIME. Because i didnt have soundpacks until i got a 15 dollar giftcard in 2016. Late. 2016. Its not that hard. You dont need fancy intruments to still be amazing! You just need to be you. Keep ona rockin.</p>
