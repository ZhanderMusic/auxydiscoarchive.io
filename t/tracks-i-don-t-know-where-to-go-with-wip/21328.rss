    <title>Tracks I don’t know where to go with [WIP]</title>
    <link>https://disco.auxy.co/t/tracks-i-don-t-know-where-to-go-with-wip/21328</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I’ve got some projects I think could have good potential but I don’t know where to go with them, I’m open to collab on them if anyone wants to, they are all three very different styles. 

Bitcrushed/techno thingy:

https://app.auxy.co/projects/GPL-Ck2VWy9sTg_MmkrqwQ==

Trap/rap beat with vocal chops:

https://app.auxy.co/projects/bs5BDW5074NdRXIjR4cdsQ==

Some psychedelic chords: 

https://app.auxy.co/projects/dW_cAQLvJcGm-ElGRMyp-Q==

I haven’t made any full tracks in a while so I’m hoping to get back in the swing of things with these.</description>

            <p>I also did something with the chords: <a href="https://app.auxy.co/projects/5oQ2kf00LUxHJDXgHzo4aQ==" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://app.auxy.co/projects/5oQ2kf00LUxHJDXgHzo4aQ==</a></p>
<p>I did LoFi cuz that’s the first thing I thought of. I’m probably gonna finish but I wanna ask if you want me to release it (as a collab) or if you wanna release it (also as a collab)</p>

            <p>Hey guys, I’ve got some projects I think could have good potential but I don’t know where to go with them, I’m open to collab on them if anyone wants to, they are all three very different styles.</p>
<p>Bitcrushed/techno thingy:</p>

<p>Trap/rap beat with vocal chops:</p>

<p>Some psychedelic chords:</p>

<p>I haven’t made any full tracks in a while so I’m hoping to get back in the swing of things with these.</p>
