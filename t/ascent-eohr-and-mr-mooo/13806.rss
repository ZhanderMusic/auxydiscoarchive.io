    <description>Wow.

Working with Mr Mooo on multiple collaborations, I have to say, he is so talented and very fun to work with. (What a freaking legend!!!!!) We really enjoyed putting this fun, funky, and just overall bop of a song together over the past month, and now, eohr and Mr Mooo present: Ascent.
