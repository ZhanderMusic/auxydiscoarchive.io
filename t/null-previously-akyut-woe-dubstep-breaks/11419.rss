This release is the first Iâ€™ve felt 100% content with in a while, and Iâ€™m stoked to finally be sharing it with everyone :slight_smile:

Might be better suited for an October release, but I canâ€™t wait that long ðŸ˜… much love to everyone whoâ€™s been supportive of my music, you rock!

Until next time.</description>
